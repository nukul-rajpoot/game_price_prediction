*Abstract*
-----------

Many games feature community market systems where players trade in-game items for real money, with daily transactions often exceeding $100K to $1M. Some players even make a living through these markets, yet no formal research exists on their dynamics. Our goal is to create a predictive model for these markets or to provide a framework for future study, starting with CSGO, whose market model may be adaptable to similar games.

In CSGO, there are over 22,000 items, with more than 1 million daily transactions. Players trade these items on the Steam Community Market and discuss the game on Reddit. We suspect these discussions influence CSGO item prices and plan to test this relationship using sentiment analysis.
