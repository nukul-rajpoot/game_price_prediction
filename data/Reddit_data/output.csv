Individual keybinds to switch to each nade is more versatile, and it's really not much more work. I'll just practice these.

An awp in most circumstances is superior *in the right hands* , which is why you see more pro's using the AWP instead of the auto, although it does get used.

If an awper meets an auto, lets say they peek the same corner at the same time, if the awper hits him, he will likely kill him, but if he misses, he will likey die, because he cannot reload in time to get a second shot off before the auto gets his second shot off.

To kill someone with the auto in one shot, you MUST hit him in the head, the AWP can 1 shot with a body shot.

At lower levels: It dominates, at higher levels it most likely would have been better to buy an awp.


The P90, and auto shotty are (or were?) similarly hated on for similar reasons.
Newer players will do better with guns like the bison and p90, due to the fact they can move and shoot with relative accuracy, and they will not have developed the ability to stop and shoot correctly, spray control, trigger displine in the form of one taps, and accuracy, which are requirements for guns like the M4 and AK. So they can be compared to the auto similarly.


If you're dying to guns like the auto and p90 a lot, it likley means you need an increase in skill. A challenge: If you think its just the guns that are making the enemy win, you should use them too to see if thats really the case. If you use them (the guns you hate) and you still lose... complaining that its unfair that *other* people use them, or calling these people names, is transparent and it shows that you have an issue. 
If the auto and p90 etc DO give you an unfair advantage, you should be using them all the time untill people learn to counter. But they do not give you an unfair advantage, and a better player would not have an issue with these guns being used. It is up to you to develop the skill and mental/emotional strength to work out how to win no matter the circumstances, least of all what gun is being used.

Although practicing with the AK and M4 and AWP over the auto will, in the long run, be of more benifit than practicing with the auto and p90, it is ultimately your choice of how to play the game, and your responsibilty to deal with the enemy, no matter how he decides to play.

Sometimes the best way to learn is to be thrown in the fray, although when going into the game as long as you have the basics down (how to play), just let your teamates know that you will need help with call outs and strats. if they are not asshats they will usually help.

Otherwise, find someone willing to team up with you, and if like most of us they will have a second account that they dont care about rank, and willing to work with you on it.

Key things to note:

1. Have microphone and headset, keep sounds on for game, make everything else quiet as you need to be able to hear and pinpoint footsteps, reloads, and little things that help with gamesense

2. make sure you have time dedicated to playing comp. nothing pisses people off more then, sorry guys you have to kick me, my mom wants me to mow the lawn. make sure at minimal you have 1hr to spare per match, if you get asked to do something if it is only for a minute thats ok, but also let parents/gf/wife (i dont know your age) know that you are in a team game and there is penalty's for not only you but your teamates if you just leave a match, most will understand. just let them know how long it should take, and try and schedule around things. 

3. Communicate, but calmly, dont yell its B its B, take time with your call out and give as much info as possible with as few needed words.  (1 person pushed out to b site, still hear several in upper tunnels) or ( 3 spotted on long, can someone watch short but still check B till we see bomb) - (bomb spotted on cat, however watch your flanks)

2,2017-10-30,u/NoobHackerThrowaway,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/79m4pu/getting_out_of_nova_is_hard/dp3e7zw/,"Best way to progress in rank in this game is:

Basicaly a ""good"" game happens when

1. No hackers or smurf

2. No trolls/derankers/retards on your team

3. The match is more or less even, not one team completly dominating the other.

CSGO is incredibly fustrating because the times when all 3 criteria are met are few and far between.

I have a solid team but the enemy team has a hacker 

No hackers but theres a retard on our team

No hacker or smurfs and my team is solid, but now we're just dominating (possibly because of a deranker/troll/retard on the other team)

Unfortnatly only 1 of the things on that list are within your control and that is your teamates.

Once you have good teammates to play with, and you're playing to the best of your abilities, your rank will start to climb steadily due to the fact that you'll always habe good teamates, so 'good' games will only come down to hackers/smurfs on the other team which no game will ever be free of, even ESEA has cheaters.

Best way to find good people to play with:

1. Play good

2. Add the players from your team and the enemy team who you think are good

3. Try to play with those people

4. Realize a large % of those players you added are going to leave/unfriend or you will want to unfriend/not play with them. But a small % of those players will be consistantly good and not horrible to get along with. 

5. Rinse/repeat untill you have (this is key) 
!more than one! group of 5 players to play with at any given time. 

6. Some % of those players you hand picked and have been playing with for a long while, will also leave/unfriend/not be able to play for whatever reason. So this proccess of playing and adding people needs to be pretty well constant. Even when I had a team together, there was occasionaly members that left or had other problems that ment that needed to be replaced. You will never be free of this, although the higher you go in rank and the more serious you get, the less you'll have to grind for people to play with, even the pro's have to take on new talent or git rid of old talent.

I would go as far as to say In silver and nova finding good people to play with is even more important than winning, due to the fact that there needs to be a such a heavy heavy focus on this at lower levels.


Now you can watch your rank skyrocket as you've cherry picked the best possible teammates that will play with you, eliminating as well as possible another variable that makes csgo fustrating.

Hope this helps.

Buddy, honestly, at silver you should focus only on 2 things.

1. Having fun despite the bullshit

2. Finding good teammates

Thats it.

Crosshair placement, studder step, strategy etc. Will all come just from playing. Last year I was DMG without ever looking up one video. 

THE biggest factor in your rank progression are the people you play with. 

Even more than your skill, you can be the skill of a GNM and be stuck in SEM just by the fact that your team sucks and cant re-frag, follow directions, or any of the other myriad of bullshit players do/don't do. It's a team game and there is only so much one person can do. (However you should still try to carry games that seem impossible just as an excercise to push yourself)

What most people do is blame their rank on always getting shitty teammates, they are right by one way of looking at it, but they forget that:

#yourteamisyourfault

Thats right:

It is YOUR choice to solo q. Therfore, it is YOUR fault if you lose a game due to your teammates being a few chromosomes short of real people.

Just like how if you get blackout drunk and don't have total control over your actions, said actions are still your fault because YOU decided to get drunk.

Hitting accept on a match is like saying yes to the question of ""do you accept you may be playing with a gaggle of handicaped nerds who are about to kick you at the end of the match even though you're carrying?""

Solo quing is saying yes to this question.

So, It is YOUR responsibility to collect good teamates to play with.

If you do not understand this, you simply will not progress.

Now, there are always exceptions to the rule,  there are some players who progress just fine  through the ranks, even up to global. 

But the vast majority of players will get stuck in certian elo's if they only solo q, especialy at lower ranks due to the higher concentration of AIDS.

So how do I find good teammates?

What even makes a good teammate?

1. Skill

2. Compatibilty with your personality and schedule


Some people get better with teamates who are more relaxed, who 'table talk' and joke around. Some play worse.

Some people get better with constructive criticism (crosshair placement damnit!), some people hate being told what to do.

Teammates who you get along with are totaly case-by case, and ontop of this your tastes will probably change over time. A teammate who you initialy liked, a year later, may be a diffrent story.

You're really the only one who knows which teamates are compatible with your personality.

The end goal is to have a (and this is KEY) few teams of 5 to play with while you progress in rank, eventualy playing mkre and more with one 'main' team so that you can pratice drills/executes and become more and more familar with eachother like Lebron and Kyrie.


The actual process is fairly simple.

1. Play solo q 

2. Cherry pick the best players from that match, from your team and the other team

3. Add them to friends list

Rinse repeat 1-3 untill a good base of players have been built up.

Keep in mind, a VERY large % of the players that you cherry pick, will for whatever reason need to be un-picked or will remove themselves (called turnover)

For this reason, ESPECIALY at lower levels, you will need to be constantly looking for new talent.

The more you progress, the less you'll have to find new players, but even the pro teams have some turnover, so you'll never totaly be free of this.

Finding teamates you can trust will make progressing in rank a much much nicer experience.

It will not totaly eliminate the bullshit. Even your own hand-picked teamates can have bad games, or go on tilt. Hackers and smurfs will always be a thing, even in ESEA.

If you have a mic amd make good callouts even if your not doing to well can make the difference. I was playing in nova master to MG1( not the highest rank ik) and we had a guy on our team who had only 20 hours into the game and it was clear this was one of his first games he played yet he did not have amy sound because he wouldn't listen to us nor did he have a mic or use his keyboard to communicate so we kicked him by the 12th round because we were losing by 5 rounds and it was a close game and we won 16-14. It was not something that we wanted to do because we were once there but if your not gonna communicate or call out then a bot is better. So for advice play only maps you know the callouts if you need further assistance Cruxal on youtube is a great youtuber who makes easy to follow videos in callouts amd other tips. Learn to communicate to your team and learn fundamentals and good luck on your csgo adventure I hope this helped you see what could make a difference between getting kicked and not getting kicked.

The main draw here is the dedicated C4 drop button. Switching to C4 and then pressing drop is two actions, taking twice as long, and is clumsier than just pressing a single drop C4 button. Sometimes you need to do it quickly.

My custom binds are all about economy of motion; accessing actions as quickly as possible, avoiding displacing my fingers from the movement keys whenever possible. Single keys designated to each grenade type, mousewheel scroll up for knife, switch between primary and secondary with mouse thumb button, etc.

Technically, you don't ever have to actually switch to the bomb. Just press and hold ""use"" while on the bomb site (and not looking at a gun) and you'll plant the bomb. This is also more efficient than switching to bomb and then holding left mouse. If you want, to preserve default binds as much as possible, you could do away with the useless bomb switch key, 5, and rebind it to drop the bomb as above. I've already rebound 5 to another action, and I like having bomb drop easily accessible with a twitch, on V (my movement cluster is shifted to the right already; ESDF)."
3,2017-12-13,u/-Pelvis-,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/7jcy1e/bind_recommendation_bind_v_use_weapon_c4dropsay/dr6lnk4/,"Well, this is just a bomb drop bind. It works because there is only one single weapon in that slot. You could definitely do a ""drop pistol"" or ""drop primary"" bind, but there's really no point if you have your primary and secondary weapons easily accessible, as well as your drop key.

I use `bind MOUSE4 ""invnextnongrenade""` to quickly switch between pistol and primary with my right thumb (defaults to primary when switching from something else; double tap for pistol in that case), and I've got drop bound to `q`, so it's really quick to drop weapons; two little twitches with non-movement fingers (I use ESDF instead of WASD, so `q` is left pinky)

As for weapon drops, the quickest way to do that would be to have buy binds set up (or ""give"" in the case of cheats); press buy bind key, and then drop key.

Here are mine:

    bind RCTRL ""buy decoy""
    bind UPARROW ""buy molotov""
    bind LEFTARROW ""buy hegrenade""
    bind DOWNARROW ""buy smokegrenade""
    bind RIGHTARROW ""buy flashbang""
    bind KP_INS ""buy ak47""
    bind KP_DEL ""buy deagle""
    bind KP_END ""buy mp9""
    bind KP_DOWNARROW ""buy ump45""
    bind KP_PGDN ""buy p90""
    bind KP_LEFTARROW ""buy ssg08""
    bind KP_5 ""buy awp""
    bind KP_RIGHTARROW ""buy scar20""
    bind KP_HOME ""buy mag7""
    bind KP_UPARROW ""buy galilar""
    bind KP_PGUP ""buy aug""
    bind KP_SLASH ""buy tec9""
    bind KP_MULTIPLY ""buy p250""
    bind KP_PLUS ""buy vesthelm""
    bind KP_MINUS ""buy vest""
    bind ENTER ""buy defuser"" // you may need to use KP_ENTER on Windows; Linux bug makes KP_ENTER respond only to ENTER

So, to drop an AWP, I press `KP_5` `q`.

It runs much better on Arch with LXDE installed than Windows 8.1. I play on lowered resolution and get good fps. On startup, the game takes about 5 minutes to load. Joining games also takes about 5 minutes. After that, the first game you join WILL boot you back out to the menu for a disconnect. After that, the second game you join will work, but have intense lag spikes. The game runs stably after the second match. Exiting the game also takes about 5 minutes, I have a hotkey setup to kill the process immediately so it exits faster. All graphics settings are on the lowest. Because of the lowered resolution, it's more difficult to shoot enemies accurately. You also won't be able to alt-tab without huge amounts of lag"

I do not know how common this scam is, and if there is a better place for me to post it please let me know so I can move it. 

The gist of the scam is as follows: 

Trading Policy! ....
....................................................................................................................................................
* before trading on me, i just want to be sure that your skins/knifes/keys are safe. 
* i will ask your trade URL so that i can send you my offer directly, cause i will send it on web. 
* add me on Discord, so that i will let you choose what do you want to be offered for your knifes/keys/skins. 
* before we do normal trading on steam, i want an assurance first that your skins/keys/knifes are 100% marketable and sellable on OPSkins market site. 
* and if we clarify that your skins/knifes/keys are safe to be deposit into OPskins inventory, then we will do normal trade directly on steam. 
.......................................................................................................

You follow this process all the way until the opskins sales window, you will be asked to queue your item for sale to prove that it is marketable. You will be asked not to deposit the item on to the website, but you will get a trade request from a fake opskins account. This bot is operated by the scammers. 

OPskins never sends a request of any kind when you queue an item for sale. They only send a trade request once you have selected to deposit your skin and confirmed it. This is how they scam you out of your item, and then proceed to blame OPskins for the problem. 

If you need any more clarity or info on this scam please let me know and I will share. I plan to make a YouTube video to show how this process is done, so you can avoid falling victim to these scrubs. "

Usually when I move my mouse from one side of the mouse pad to the other side it's a little over 180° but when this shit happens, it's sometimes not even 90°

I've been exceptionally lucky regarding cases, I'll get semi good drops from the operations and sell them, open cases, than eventually get knives that way and gamble my way up. I also have a full time job now, so because I exclusively play csgo as a hobby, I put aside some money from paychecks and buy keys for trading/gambling/openings.

If you really want skins, set money aside and purchase the ones you like. Obviously, not everyone is fortunate enough to purchase a $400+ skin in a single sitting, but if you make small purchases within a year, you could potentially trade said items for something really big and shiny afterwards.

Or gamble with a double or nothing attitude and get lucky like me, lmaoo"

Start off playing casual, but don't get used to it because Comp is really different from casual. Simply use it to familiarize yourself. My suggestion would be to also play Arms Race(similar to gun game on COD) this will help you learn the different weapons and help you discover how different the spray patterns are. You can also you this opportunity to adjust your settings in game to refine them to your specs. Also mess around with a cross hair customize from the workshop. Your cross hair can be your best friend or your worst friend.  But once you are comfortable with your play style and approach with mouse and keyboard, I would then go to comp. Once you are in comp, initially don't worry about your rank and losses. YOU WILL lose, and probably a lot and that's okay. Just remember that in the end its just a game and the ranking system is still a mystery to many people. I know many people who should be at MG and are ranked in low SE. If you are not looking to play competitively, my suggestion would be to look at games such as Fortnite (which is one of my most favorite casual games) or just browse through the free to play games on steam. Personally, I would familiarize yourself with using a mouse and keyboard before looking into getting into any competitive game. Once you learn how to handle and trust your gear, you will be able to handle a lot better then learn new skill such as scouting, reacting, and handling spray patterns. "

Note that I play this game ever since 1999, bought CS:GO at release but never really did get to like it in the begining.

I did play a couple rounds every now and then but yeah, it always felt different than 1.6 and CS:S so I moved over to other games.

Last year I finally started playing it more ""seriously"" but I was well out of the loop, especially since I have spend most of my gaming time on console.

I join a ranked match and we're getting steamrolled massively, my whole team is dead again and I am still alive but the last on the scoreboard on my team because I honestly had no idea what I was doing.

On one hand, the CS series is my most played game with thousands of hours over the last 20 years so a lot of things come ""naturally"", on the other hand, having moved back from mainly console gaming to keyboard and mouse....things were not working out so good.

So yeah, I'm the last one alive and my team all goes ""clutch or kick""...I just returned to the game and didn't even know what the heck they are talking about.

Long story short, I killed them all with my trusted little USP and my team was so hyped up that we won a few more rounds after, lost the game though.

30fps is low, so it probably affects your ability somewhat. Especially if you get fps drops. Mouse, keyboard and monitor is really just finishing touches. Many good players managed just fine with 17inch monitors and 10dollar microsoft mouses back in the day.  

Your aim is something that will gradually get better over time, you can put in some aim specific practise sure. But you will probably have more to gain from getting better at positioning and movement. Peaking and not necessary comitting to a corner, but re-positioning.  Aim maps against other players is probably the fastest way to learn, not sure if people use them anymore. But if not, then regular maps against a team of bots.  
Deathmatch is okay, but you get flanked all the time so it might get to frustrating for some.

It's a good way to get a handle of every gun with no real goal in site. Don't worry about the scoreboard, it doesn't do anything for you. You can also look up workshop maps on steam for aim_levels that help you practice. Check out youtube video on workshop maps. Don't pay attention to people yelling and being dicks.

- Turn off auto-pickup in your game menu. It will screw you over more than not. 

- Use the number keys to switch weapons and not the scroll wheel.

- If you can bother to learn, switch your scroll wheel to jump (scroll up and scroll down) and look up a bunny hopping video for a quick understanding. You don't need to master this at all but it's good to understand what and how it can be done.

- Just have fun"

Or you can use this console command to mute all players it’s much easier ( voice_enable 0 ) to mute and ( voice_enable 1 ) to unmute or you can bind this command to a key so you just hit that key and you’re good to go (Bindtoggle ""Key"" (e.g. F10) voice_enable 0) hope this helps you "

Life isn't black or white. You have to keep your mind open to new ideas and new concepts. You're either oppressing people with rage hacks or you're not. 

People aren't just full blown retarded with brain damage or normal people. There is a spectrum. Hacks are kind of like steroids. You can take 10 ml or you can take 2000ml. 

Or hacks are like murder, murdering 1 or 10 people is a lot less severe than murdering 10000 people. 

hacks improve performance, Aim, game sense, headshot ratio, accuracy. Different players will result in different performance. Maybe if with ""lowkey"" hacks, you get like a 30% performance increase. Meanwhile there are people every single game with rage aim, and auto fire where they instantly kill everyone. 0 time to kill headshots. They constantly have 20-30 frags every game meanwhile everyone else on their team has 9-4 frags each. You're bitching about people using any amount of hacks and getting a 30% performance increase meanwhile there are cheaters in every game in mge and above using 500% performance increase. That's 16 times more abuse. Why aren't you 16 times more angry at them and just consider these fixes how to permanently fix hacking? I know why, because you're ignorant, autistic and you just want something to hate, and that's why you're here on reddit. The shit post website. "

It's easy to understand why because all the highlight reels showcase crazy flicks. When you watch pro games pay close attention to the kills and you will notice that 90% of the time there is no flicking involved. It's all pre aim and pre fire, the goal is to move your crosshair as little as possible, not make insane flick shots. That is the key to good aim and consistency. Even if your flicks are off one day, it should only affect 10% of your kills, allowing you to still have a good game. 

This might sound counter productive but don't waste your time on aim botz. It can be beneficial to give you an edge but you need to improve other parts of your game and be a consistent player first. Focus on learning pre aim and pre fire positions on the maps you play, holding angles, isolating fights, peeking, and counter strafing. They are all a lot more important than raw aim in this game."

Communication is the key. Talk to your team even if they don't talk to you. Tell them the positions of the enemy. Even if you are death you can still tell them positions from the view of other players. This can boost your Team so much.

Don't blame you team if you loose and never get toxic to other players. If you yell at your team they get frustrated to and play even worse. You can give them friendly tips if they did something obvious wrong.

It's a pretty good keyboard in general, I find myself only hitting multiple keys at a time when I am choking a clutch; meaning the keys are quite distinctive and far apart.

The keyboard is very high quality, though it's small price in comparison to a lot of other mechanical keyboards. It does come with Kalih switches, though; Kalih switches are made by the same company that manufacture switches for your car. I believe if you can get your hands on some MX switches, you will be able to swap them with the Kalih switches if that's your preference.

But, unlike many claims that Kalih switches feel cheap and wear out quickly, I would have to disagree with these claims and say they feel somewhat identical, if not better, than Cherry MX  switches.

Also, if you plan to travel a lot, this is probably one of the heaviest keyboards you might use. Everything that the keyboard does is located in the keyboard rather than software. For example, you control the RGB, Macros, LED Profiles, et cetera using the function keys on the keyboard. 

This keyboard has never failed me. It's always recognized when I've pushed a key and I believe it is somewhat water-resistant... Don't ask me, I'm not trying. If you're on a budget, this is a great mechanical keyboard and I would suggest it. If you're not on a budget this is still a great mechanical keyboard, but there are possibly other keyboards that are better.

Just watch some videos before actually buying it if you're considering it."

At least don't spend all 100$ you have.
You're better off buying the skins that you like than opening a case.
The odds of getting something that's actually worth it is the same, be it 1 case or 100 cases.
Many people tends to believe opening more cases will raise your chances of getting covert/knives/gloves drop; but chances are either you get lucky with only one key or give your money to our lord Gaben with 100 keys and still get nothing good.
0.26% for knives/gloves will always be 0.26% no matter how many cases you open.
If you really want to do it, maybe just get a key.
I myself got a covert drop (both USP-S) twice, with only one key each try.
But those drops negated the costs for all the keys that I have bought before, so at least I got that going for me.
Just buy those damn skins, you'll not regret it."

Thats your problem. Dont catch up to anyone, just play the game for fun. Its not a chore nor do you need to ""catch up"". The reason why I dont play MMOs is because you can get out grinded by your friends that than kinda abadon you. But in CS? I play with gold novas all the time on my LE main, and If we cant get 5 i play on my smurf. 

&gt; You cant really say it's a hardware issue either, 800x600, 50-60FPS average with drops to 20FPS, but I have seen people with worse setups than this playing 100x better than me.

... If I'd had drops under 100 I would get serious problems. ANd I actually believe that my 120fps+ on 75hz is still less than ideal, by a lot! Thats definitely fucking you up. 

&gt; But now I can understand why the whole cheating community exists; why struggle, if you can get it easier?

Consider smurfing. Also many people do it because of:

1) Curiosity or general technical interest

2) Annoyed / frustrated with cheaters / better players (like you)

3) Trolling is fun

4) Losing is horrible for them (idk why)

5) Take the game too serious and think they might get pro / to impress friends (first VAC usually fixes that)


There is a bunch more reasons, but yours is one that smurfing might get ""fixed"" in a sense to gain your confidence back. 

You seem to only look up the ladder and be frustrated, So how about climbing down the ladder a bit and kicking everybody below you in the face? Yes its a dickmove, but thats how ladders in games will always work and for the amount of times you have been kicked in the face try to kick back once. When I am on a loding streak I tend to soloQ smurf a bit, win 2-3 games come back to my main and rip everybody in half.

Sorry.

Search “retake” servers. Not bots...but essentially simulation real game scenarios in a casual environment with real players. Most shouldn’t take them too seriously...I say most

It may take some time to find one where good players won’t be toxic. But they are there. Still pretty new to the game, I would say after workshops, and using casual to get my crosshair placements / learn maps /peek angles down...the “retake” custom games were crucial to learning key parts of the game..the stuff like: when and where to throw smoke, Molly’s, practicing real prefires basic positioning and most accurate simulation of a real match in a casual setting. 

Some players take them very seriously, which is why I said it may take a few tries to get the right server. But like the other guy said down below. Don’t take the players bullshit to the heart at first. Most of the ones sweating in a casual or a retake custom have been at the same rank for years and are just mad in general.

Get used to using the numbers keys and not the scrollwheel to cycle nades/weapons, this is much more consistent and less accident prone.
Crosshair placement relies a lot on map knowledge, and knowing the timing in to predict enemy positions initially. 
Always keeping the crosshair at head level is a good habit.
I can recommend the map called ""Recoil Master - Spray Training"" on the steam workshop, does wonders if you give it a few minutes every day or so (this is spraying specifically and not so much aiming, but it helps you get a feel for the weapons).

Accuracy is how close your cross hair is to their head when you click m1. This is all in your mouse hand.   
Precision is how close your bullet lands to the centre of your crosshair.  This is all in your keyboard hand (counter-strafing, stutter-stepping, ADing).   
You are more precise, the lower your velocity is, you are most precise when you are stationary.   
Both, obviously, are necessary to get a 1-tap kill reliably.    

Basically, it doesn't matter how perfectly you line up your crosshair on their head if your first shot is more likely to land away from your crosshair than on it. If your first shot isn't precise, you're basically gambling that you hit them, no matter how sick the flick. 

I rate 2 above 3, since the majority of kills in cs:go, statistically, come from sprays, not 1-taps.   
All 3 are the fundamental necessary mechanical skills involved in CS gun-play, all are vital. 

E: obviously precision can be used to mean your clustering, ie your 'burst precision'; but the sense I'm using it in is 'how close your shot lands to where you were *actually* aiming' (the cross hair), as opposed to 'how close your first shot lands to where you were *wanting* to aim (the target).

Every gun has a trade off. A lot of people in game complain about the gay gun or the cod guns, claiming they are too easy to use etc. But the gay gun costs 5k and still requires some skill to use. Cod guns are a bit cheaper but once again, need even more bullets to kill with.

Shotguns are the complete opposite. I rarely hear anyone complain about ppl using them (except the xm perhaps, it can be abit cheesey to see someone bhopping 25 metres away from you and get a flukey headshot, but this happens with the ak aswell). Unless you are point blank to your enemy, they are basically useless and you have to rely on a CT pushing you as a terrorist or as a CT, being able to get into position before an enemy pushes site. If these things dont happen, they are essentially useless and getting 900 dollars a kill is basically the only reason i use any of these weapons.

I hear ppl complain about the pro 90, it is usually awpers as it is incredibly easy to get up close and take out 2 or 3 of these camping sluts in a single reload. I love it when they jump into pit on A long and i get in for a sneaky flank, 15k down the drain easy. the p90 is only an smg though and it is more expensive than alot of rifles in the game (rifled barrels and AP ammunition is usually what drives the price of a gun up), so it is warranted in being as good as it is. SMGs get a bad wrap in this game in general and are considered 'forcing' when you purchase one. The pro 90 is for the dedicated smg user who has a bit more money to spend.

The awp- I do not have a problem with this gun, but i do have a problem with some ppl who use it, claiming it is the ultimate measure of skill in the game. People who use awps a lot are generally the people who criticise others for using pro 90s, cod guns or gay guns. These people feel they are the ultimate in this game and any time they get killed by one of the other mentioned guns, they are quick to point out how that person should uninstall the game and those guns should be nerfed as they degenerate gaming skill. Personally i think the AWP is a high risk, high reward weapon. it can work out well for you, depending on how the enemy comes at you and on what weapons they have, but if you find yourself in a bad situation and you lose it, don't get salty, learn to use a different gun, there is more to the game than the awp"

Sticking to a few maps at a time will help you master prefiring all of the random angles people play and help you learn proper crosshair placement. Practice your aim, movement, and positioning and watch pros play and copy their movement/positioning. Play a lot of deathmatch - if you can go positive in non-Valve deathmatch then you will at least be at Nova Master level. Communication is of key importance in your rank so always make accurate callouts and try and guide your team and tell them what you think the enemies are doing. If you sense them rotating and your teammates are sitting holding angles like idiots, tell your team to rotate or at least try and get some information in a different position. Good luck, getting out of silver feels hard but once you do you will fly through Nova. And of course, the best way to improve is to play with good players, so always add the top fraggers on your team (and the enemy team) as well as people who actually use their mic and communicate effectively."

That means holding your crosshair around head height at the edge of corners your peak. You can find more of all of this on youtube.

Movement -- Movement in CS:GO is slightly unique. The movement keys are controlled by giving you acceleration, so tapping the opposite direction of moving will make your character stop on a dime. Learning how to strafe shoot can prevent you from dying too much. Most people call this spamming 'adadad' meaning just tapping the A and D keys to stutter left and right. This not only makes you harder to hit, but also gives increased accuracy for the times you are standing still. Practice stopping on a dime, and making an accurate shot.

Recoil -- Another thing somewhat unique to CS:GO are [recoil patterns](http://csgoskills.com/academy/spray-patterns/). They are memorizable, and so many people have the guns they use most frequently memorized. For example, with an M4A1-S the recoil patter goes straight up and to the right, so to counteract that, you move your mouse down and to the left during the spray. To avoid too much recoil, and when fighting at distance, try single shots, or small bursts. Watch some pro games to see how their crosshair moves when they shoot.

Strategy -- There's way too much to put here, but know that counter-strike is not purely a run-n-gun game. Using grenades effectively can win games. Smokes are great, flashes are too if you're confident in your aiming and movement to get a pick on a blind guy. Some people use grenades to lure the enemy team to defend a site, and then go to the other site. Some teams will rush one site a lot, giving you a chance to rush through the other site and come from behind. Economy also plays a big part in game. If you're playing defuse games (most popular mode) you should be paying attention to your money. Look into videos on economy because it would make more sense. Some advice about economy that I can fit in here, is when trying to regain the economy lead, try certain things, like buying a good pistol and stealing an enemies weapon, asking for a buy from a teammate, buy head armour if you're Terrorist, and skip it if you're Counter-Terrorists up against AK47's and AWPS (they will always 1 shot to the head so not a big deal). Make sure you're using weapons the way they're intended, for example, rush with SMG's to get closer, medium distance for rifles, and medium to long for snipers.

THE NUMBER ONE MISTAKE I SEE INEXPERIENCED PLAYERS MAKE: Making footsteps too loud. You need to know when you have time to walk somewhere, and when you need to run. Most of the time you can walk, and you should, because the enemy could be on the other side of a wall, and you just gave away your exact position. Sound queues save lives, and will get you called a wall hacker, so turn up that volume and get rid of the music (once you're comfortable with what you're doing ingame). THAT MEANS YOU YELLOW, STOP RUNNING NEXT TO ME WHILE I WALK AND GIVING AWAY MY POSITION! On another note, some people may find it hard to differentiate between one, two, or three people's footsteps. If you're teammate is running, you might be able to sneak in some run, or just letting off shift every few seconds, or alternate who runs and who walks, just do what comes natural.

TL;DR Think of the game as a strategy game, do research on the base mechanics, and you'll be better off than 40% of the people you start with

Watch some pro games to see what things should sorta look like, and **watch your own replays**!"

I honestly haven't done anything to the game at all. Basically I installed it, then I opened it, then I went to ""keyboard settings"" and it was like that. In fact, as soon as I click ""Keyboard settings"", there's a chance that the game will crash. It doesn't act that way with any other setting menu.

The project you listed (Dvorak CSGO config) is interesting! I'll have to take a look at that, but it probably won't do me a whole lot since I use my mouse on the left side. I can always just use my mouse right-handed while I play but it would be difficult to be as steady with it (I've heard that smooth &amp; accurate mouse movement is very important for this kind of game).

2,2018-08-03,u/Lights_n_Fire,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/945t3l/panorama_opinion/e3ivjcr/,"TLDR at the bottom.

Well this is a major UI update/release. And with every major release there is going to be issues, bugs, performance variations, and possibly have features which are taken out that were available in the old UI but isn’t present in the new UI.

Also the new UI looks very ‘Metro-like’ in design and some people like myself don’t always prefer that look. Huge part of the reason why I hated Windows 8 soo much.

The Panorama beta has being in place for a month or 2 so they had worked out some bugs... but think about it. The old Scaleform UI had multiple years of refinement and is pretty much bug free in its current state.

Even if you take a look at this recent change log on Panorama there is A LOT of change activity that is going on. And this will ramp up exponentially now that the UI change is forced to the public.

I’m not here to say that Scaleform is better BUT... there is no denying that Panorama is WAYYYYYY in its infancy and it’s gonna take some time to iron the stuff out to ensure:

1. The UI experience is smooth.
2. All bugs and glitches associated with the new design are squashed.
3. The UI experience compliments the gameplay and doesn’t detract from it.
4. The UI does everything Scaleform can currently do and have potential to do a lot more (I believe this is one of the driving factors for the redesign).
5. The new UI will work with the Source 2 engine (another key factor in the redesign and planning for the future).
6. The new design is more efficient in terms of its programming, therefor isn’t going to heavily effect low-end PC users.

So bottom-line is that this launch option to opt-out of the UI is very important to folks like myself because for me I’m a lot more patient than others and I would rather jump on the Panorama UI much further down the track when a lot of the things mentioned here are sorted out.

TL;DR
Panorama is still in its infancy and and has a lot to work on. People like myself are more patient and willing to stick to the old UI longer so that when Valve does force people onto Panorama, the transition will be smoother because it’s had more time to be worked on. Some people don’t like to change over too early and have a bumpy experience cause things still needed working out.

Hope this makes sense :)"

You just called it retarded, I know you’re 12 and hard to have proper grammar and not act like a 10 year old but isn’t that harsh even for a kid? Pal, nobody deleted the game because of a new ui, it changed nothing with the game, exact gameplay, exact game mechanics  etc. It’s a smother experience and makes the game run better, perform better , making it smoother in every way, old one was a outdated ui done in 2015, it was laggy , it wasn’t as smooth.

(eg. smoke wall in nuke, triple smoke on mirage a site) Dont forget to have fun dont let the rank system fuck u over ma dude!!! And from my newbie friends i can tell the basics they fuck up all the time is :

1. Taking forever to throw nades
2. Shit game sense
3. Too much advice from everybody causing them to panic
4. Tilt too early!!!

FYI dont tilt at your teammates! i mean i do that sometimes but its because im with my friends hahaha in public games i dont tilt at all becasue it just fucks up your team morale. in fact when you are encouraging and communicate clearly and briefly but effectively you can comeback from a 13 -2 game TRUST ME been there done that multiple times. Will make your day for sure!

ps. DO NOT ONLY STICK TO MIRAGE AND DUST 2!!!!! play multiple maps and get yourself familiar with inferno cache mirage dust 2 overpass nuke!!! i managed to teach my newbie friends all these maps and we never reply 1 same map in the day! it really helps! and within this year i brought them from silver 4 and Silver elite masters to now nova 1s and 2s :D you can do it too!"

1,2018-10-22,u/NoobHackerThrowaway,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/9q6yqn/how_do_you_feel_about_having_inexperienced/e89fyzv/,"THIS.

The mute button is OP. I mute people all the fucking time for a lot less. Sometimes its thier voice, sometimes. It's something they said. Heck sometimes I have no idea why I felt I should mute someone, my instincts just told me I should. It's not personal I just need to concentrate, and some peoples voices, even if they are great players, even if they are calm and cordial, still distract me.

Before I started playing it fast and loose with the mute, I would have shouting matches with randoms on the regular but then after, I felt like a pussy ""oh what you can't take a little critisim and you have to mute, what a pussy"" but I realized, (key) muting distracting people lets me keep as much mental energy on the game as possible. 

As soon as I have to explain something (especially in the middle of a round) mental energy is diverted. If I have to listen to a complaint, or sighing on the mic, mental energy is diverted. If I have to listen to a hackusation, mental energy diverted. If I have to listen to fighting on the mic, mental energy diverted.

Be more liberal with the mute button. Learn to read the minimap and develop gamesense so your reliance on mic callouts is minimized. (bind f10 voice_enable 0 is a life saver especially at lower ranks) 



One thing I've learned is that, basically no one can take criticism. ESPECIALLY when emotions are high in the middle of a game. ESPECIALLY with randoms. Especially if you have to go into a long explaination or start an argument as to why something is better/worse. (like how you should stick together on a 2v1 CT side, not split up one to each site) (like how its not all that bad to buy an auto under certian circumstances) (like how you shouldn't put 3 people on A-site on dust 2 every round) (like how you want some form of mid control nearly every round on T-side on mirage)(like how everyone should really learn a few basic smokes for thier favorite maps) 

For the most part, giving advice/critisims to random players is like throwing pearls to the swine. It won't be appreciated and you should just save your breath. Mute and play on. 

On the flip side, there are a handful of things I have picked up and implemented directly from pointers in game or gentle ribbing. 

-&gt; you really sprayed his feet good op
-&gt; you sure got a good aimlock on the ground, if we get attacked by midgets OP has us covered. 

These can serve as good reminders and are often absorbed much better as they have a positive tone. 

When I first started, I got the majority of tips from other players while I played. (Like the old 1.6 advice to spray at thier ankles!) I didn't reddit and I didn't YouTube pointers. Tips from more Experienced players was actualy one of the things that drew me into the game, the vets knew these secrets and I was getting the inside scoop how cool! 

Now that I've been playing a little longer, I do my own research and practice and have my own ideas about how to play the game. Now 6years deep, It is unlikely someone will show me something I don't already know or give me a novel pointer. For the most part I know what to do and must concentrate on doing it. 

But If you have to give advice, it's got to be short and it has to be *funny*. Otherwise it won't be absorbed and very likely you will just be ignored. 

Tl;Dr. Experiment with the mute button.
I am team ""fast and loose mutes"" but because you are so new, you might want to play the mute game a little tighter.

For giving advice: generally, make it funny and consise or just don't.

Just my two cents, would really like to hear other players opinions on this. "

My key bits of advice would be:

 **Recognise how important sound is.** It's a game changer, and you'll instantly improve when you start paying attention to it. Don't listen to music or podcasts etc while playing competitive.

**Learn angles.** Aim is important, and as guys like /u/furkitare suggested, DM is fantastic for grinding it: But the most important part to me of learning to get into more ''serious'' (Quotes obligatory, as we're all fucking noobs in the great scheme of this game anyway) side is learning positions, angles etc. This *will* come naturally, even when it feels like everyone else knows exactly where to stand etc all the time. You'll catch on quick. This carried me from Silver to LE. Who needs to twitch aim when you already have the crosshair in the right place for their head!? 

 **Learn Grenades**. If you're getting into competitive, or not-deathmatch games, learning grenades will bump you up hugely in relation to your team and your rank. There's loads of amazing resources for them online, but learning 1 or 2 smokes for each map will make your life infinitely easier, and people will love you for it (even if they express it through Cyka Blyat)

 **Stop caring about K/D.** Your Kill to death is actually rather unimportant, while it's not *useless*, there's more important things. Play with your team, help *them* do as best as they can do (Enabling them through grenades, smart angles, good info!) and you'll get better off the back of it. Also will make yourself some friends.

 **Use a microphone**. This is pretty self explanatory, but the more you play, the more  you'll learn just *how* important communication is in this game. 

There's various ''aim trainers'' that will help you get muscle memory in, i'd suggest googling those as i've not really used them, but they seem extremely popular - so there must be a reason.

 And finally: **Find some friends to play with**. CS:GO Pub is... Well look, it's shit. You'll get amazing games, and you'll meet amazing people, but you'll have a *lot* of headaches if your only way of playing is on your own. Easiest way to do this? Just add good players or nice players you meet in matches, group up with them for the next, etc. This community can be toxic, you gotta surround yourself with the cool ones.

Above all though, have fun. CS is a long term investment in terms of skill. But it's a blast. "

The match was in official Valve casual game and probably also works in competitive.

&amp;#x200B;

**How is it done?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Requirements:**

*AMD Graphics card.(I do not believe this works on Nividia cards)*

*Administrative Access*

&amp;#x200B;

**---Warning I am not responsible for any damage caused by following these steps. Always have a backup of your computer!---**

&amp;#x200B;

1.Press \[WINDOWS KEY\] +\[R\] and type 'regedit', then press 'OK'. If a popup come asking for administrative access then press 'YES'.

&amp;#x200B;

2.Once in Registry Editor, go to the following folders:

Computer&gt;HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE&gt;SYSTEM&gt;CurrentControlSet&gt;Control&gt;Video

&amp;#x200B;

3.You will see a couple of Folders inside Video with the format of: {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}. Find all folders with a sub folder '0000' (there may be more than one) and look for one containing a folder titled 'UMD'.

&amp;#x200B;

4.Click 'UMD' once and create a String Value by right clicking 'New &gt; String Value'. Name the String Value 'LodAdj'

&amp;#x200B;

5.Double click on the file and enter 5 as the value and press 'OK'. (value between -5 to 5, 5 being the lowest quality)

&amp;#x200B;

6.Close Registry Edit and launch 'Counter Strike : Fortress 3'

valve pls fix

Eighter you agree to trade an item, in which case the steam app doesn't stop you from doing so, or you don't agree to trade, in which case there is simply no trade.

When someone tries to scam you with look-alike items or otherwise, you would also eighter agree or disagree with the trade offer, the steam app doesnt magically check for you if the trade is indeed what you want the trade to be - funnily WITHOUT the steam app, there is less chance to get scammed, since you can view and cancel the trade for a whole 2 weeks before it's actually done.

Valves argument was to bring more security to trading and account management. I can't find a scenario in which the steam app can prevent stupid users to do stupid things, as we all know, scams are very much still present.

Eighter you are stupid and/or uncautious and have to learn the hard way OR you are smart and/or cautious and already learned from the mistakes that others made. It's not like most scam schemes are unknown, but rather that people still fall for it in masses. And why do people still fall for lowkey scams? Because of greed, impatience and lack of caution. Nothing an app could do anything about IMO.

It only hinders everyone who isn't using it - scammers use it and scam victims use it, they got around it pretty easy. But only because Valve forced them to, with no decrease in scams afaik."

Don't play religiously anymore so I'm hard stuck MGE/DMG. My settings have changed 100 times since then. But I was feeling down recently because I blamed my bad performance on my settings. So I took a step back. Said f*** it and went with settings that felt natural. 1920x1080(give me the most clear vision on my screen) and 900 dpi 0.9 sens(not too slow and not too fast, I can control it but actually turn.) Then when I got into match,  I didn't care about how I was doing and just made sure I was supporting the team( call outs, Utility's, getting the essential trades) Then I started top fragging without even knowing it until I hit tab. Then my confidence kicked in and I topped fragged even more.

What I'm trying to say is: Don't worry about kills. Worry about rounds. You have to admit the fact that you will not do so good in some games. But as long as you dont let it go to your head and get yourself down, i swear you can get an ace the next round if you dont get bumbed. Cofidence is key too. Also dont forget to have fun. Yeah, winning is fun but you should have some good laughs with your team even if you lose. I always try to throw in a joke or two to keep the morale up 

Stewie2k went 0/11 by half time in a game once, but he bounced back, so can you. I just got done playing a game it was 4/11,a complete lose for me and my team, but we didn't get toxic or discouraged and we brought it back. 16/12

""Hey there.

&amp;#x200B;

I get this bug every time I open csgo and have discord already running. I can make the overlay thingie go away if i Close Discrod, and then Open Discord again and then dont alt+tab or use the Overlay keyboard shortcut to make it pop up when i'm in-game.

&amp;#x200B;

When this bug started i also have gotten Two VAC errors where i've been kicked from games due to vac auth errors and i had to reboot in order to make cs work again because verifying the Game Cache didn't work. And no, i'm not one of those people that modify files and/or use any form of hacks so it's no other setting or file that caused it.

The \*only\* thing i did before this bug started to happen was to update Discord and ive tried reinstalling Discord and ofc i have rebooted etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, for some reason the Weather ""widget"" is usually visble on top of the game i'm running even though I never use it from within Discord.

&amp;#x200B;

Just dropping this by to see if anyone else is experiencing this issue.

laso posting it to r/CSGO to check to see if its a steam/csgo issue or a Discord specific issue.

I assume the way the ones that change based on the key your pressing use a program on your PC to capture keyboard input and are completely separate from the game.

In order to do one based on health you would have to read the games memory to find your health which could theoretically trigger a vac ban.

That being said. As I'm typing this I swear I'm remembering some kind of API that valve officially released that allowed for modifications to the game without cheating. I don't know if this could be used to make a program like this. Maybe somebody that knows more about it can say."

This, is actually insane. Not because of what the hack is doing but how boring is this dudes life? In all honesty. No salt involved. I only play casually these days (ffa, retakes).

But what forsaken was doing, he still had to engage in the game. 

This dude is literally spamming jump, and holding a movement key. I imagine doing this for hours just staring at a screen. Playing CS:GO or any video game for that matter for hours upon hours to some people is considered a complete waste of time.

But as a gamer, even I would be BORED TO TEARS within 15 minutes of this shit. Does anybody else feel that way? I mean I can easily drain a day away to a good immersive game. But this...Minesweeper looks more enjoyable. 

I can’t honestly imagine living a life where I literally have nothing more enjoyable to do than to load up a game and hold S to move (or w or whatever they use) and whatever button they use to jump. 

I’d legit rather beat off for 8 hours than do this. My god, I have a completely new perspective. Yes he’s a cheater, but damn in the real world I feel terrible for this person. 

If I had to guess another hobby that would interest someone like this. I imagine it would be watching paint dry. 

OP if this is you - and if you are lying and saying “this is my alt I play legit via hubs.” I have no reason not to believe you. But feel free to DM me if that is a lie and this is the only way you can enjoy the game. Maybe you just need a friend.

Learn how to pre aim corners, that usually comes after hours of  playing the game. Don't ever look at the ground and walk. Always keep your crosshair at a position where an enemy can walk out. Crosshair placement is one of the most key aspects of the game. Keep grinding it out playing some deathmatch and workshop maps like ybot prac arena where you could spend 10 mins getting used to your muscle memory. Another key tip every beginner needs to know : play with a low sensitivity. It hurts in the beginning and you'll suck but IT IS WORTH IT. Try reducing it to around 1.2 in game sensitivity with around 800 mouse dpi. It'll take you a week to get used to it by it helps you get way more precise and accurate.
Learn more maps and don't stick to just dust2. You should know the basic few maps along with common angles that you could play as a ct. Learn how to communicate with your team. Give info that's useful. Don't just be like ""Ahhh help me b, they rushing"". Instead keep calm, tell them you see 3 coming towards b. Try and be accurate with the callouts. Also, be very patient. Patience can get you more kills than anything else. In lower ranks, people are in a hurry to finish the rounds quicker. But why not use the 1:45 thats given to you? Play the rounds slow, allow the opponents to make the mistakes and don't over rotate. The higher you go up, the more you'll realize that people tend to split up and play for map control rather than straight up rushing b.
Please for the love of God, learn the basic smokes from each map (eg : ct, stairs, jungle, connector for mirage. Xbox  for dust2. A cross, b ct smoke for cache). These smokes are what helps you execute better and get your chances of winning the round increase.
Please don't play for frags. You can have 50 kills but it won't matter if the scoreline reads 14-16. Play for the team. Put the teams needs above yours. You may have the urgency to knife someone who's in a corner when you're 3v1. But I've seen rounds be lost that way. Be smart. Always check your corners no matter how sure you are the they won't be there.
Now the final tip I can give you for now : it's just a game, do not forget to remember that. Cs go is a beautiful game and it is well known for its community that can rage in the split of a second. Always keep your cool even if you're losing 16-0. You're not a professional and you're not going to get paid for playing. So why lose your mental health over this game just becuase some other teammate of yours is playing the game on a gaming wheel instead of a mouse. Teammates are not something we can choose and always expect to get the most toxic ones if you solo q. If you're serious about ranking up, you would wanna befriend good players/teammates that you meet along the way. Try and incorporate their play style. Watch a lot of pro matches. You'll be surprised how much you can learn.
Cheers and have fun mate. "

2. Dont forget to buy Equipment and Nades ( Yes also a Decoy can be useful. as fake flash )
3. Listen! ( Even the slightest noise a nade makes from tapping the wall can be a crucial info to winning the round )
4. Look closely ( Barrels of guns behind a corner, tiny parts of legs, arms and also chickens can give you and a team the advantage )
5. Learn the map callouts. Your team cant do anything with ""there behind that grey corner where u died the last time!""
6. Give your team some info and keep the info short.
7. Dont reload just cause you have only 29/30 bullets in your mag.
8. Give your teammates info on weapons the enemy has ( each gun has a different sound when fired. you can also listen for the sound of scopes and differ between snipers and scoped ARs )
9. almost every grenade has a different sound when they tap the wall ( but watch out for decoys since the sound of the tap is similar to the flashbang )
10. Watch your economy, if you lose some rounds you probably wont have much money and you better go with the starting pistol, even if you may not be able to kill someone, you can still be lucky and pick the enemys gun when theyre dead.
11. Plant the bomb. Even when the enemy is dead, you can still gain some extra money if you plant the bomb before the round is over.
12. Watch for splits. When 4 people are spotted on a site, the bomb could still be somewhere else.
13. If the bomb is dropped and youre a CT: COVER the Bomb. Ts cant win without a plant or eliminating all the CTs
14. If youre a T and the bomb is planted: Cover the entries to the bomb site. if you know someone is there, youre best off showing them that youre still defending if its a 1v1 or 2v2. ( Fire a few taps onto thee CTs position and stay covered, trying to get the bomb to explode ) Playtime is the Keyword.
15. A bomb can be defused in 10 seconds without a defuse kit and 5 seconds with a defuse kit. keep that in mind ( there is a option in the settings which plays music at the 10 sec mark, to make it a bit more easy for you to realize it )
16. DONT try to snipe from mid to T spawn on Dust 2 at the round start. Just dont try it please."

Spending 20 dollars on account that is just to hack on is a high threshold for some people. No one said this is harder, because it isn't. But I don't agree it goes with ease.  


Lets say a hacker gets caught in 2 days, an ideal situation. Isn't it worth the 20 dollars for Valve? They can then spend more money on the game itself.   


To reach this I would increase the popularity of Overwatch, it is a good tool to get rid of hackers, quickly and efficiently. In the past days I did 30-40 Overwatch cases, I already got half of them rewarded. So needless to say, that if you go through Overwatch, it can go fairly quick. Even in this current state where it has a very low popularity. If they were to increase, rewards/satisfaction/regular updates, idk.  


For Example.

**Rewards:**  After being at least X% successful every Y cases, you will be rewarded a random chest and corresponding key.

**Satisfaction:** Every time you successfully finished a case, not just send ""your exp is ready"", but make a 'match history' for your Overwatch cases, and send something like. ""Case # was completed successfully, player has been punished for *'offense'* and has been *'punishment'.* Thanks for your help and support, we will send more cases your way! Keep up the good work.""   
**Regular updates:** 2 parts.Firstly, Valve telling the positive effects of Overwatch. Secondly, you will get a message with your success rate, Overwatch rating, etc.  


Some of these things would take little time and effort to implement and can have good impact."

1,2018-12-15,u/tdavoulas,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/a629m4/new_to_csgo_tips_appreciated/ebtscnp/,"There are some things you are going to want to practice on a daily basis. 

1.) Raw aim/flicks
 To train these, go to maps like ""Aim_botz"" and ""Training_aim_csgo2"" which you can find in the workshop. 15-30 minutes of playing on these maps should be enough, you will get better slowly over time. Focus on accuracy. On aim_botz you can shoot stationary targets or moving ones, whatever you feel like training. I personally feel as though there is little difference so I just shoot stationary targets. 
Videos on how to set up the maps: 
https://youtu.be/wWaTzSjE5i0

If you want, you can also practice ""tracking"" a Target by equipping a pistol, knife, or any weapon with high movement speed and just holding your crosshair on a bots head while you move. This skill will greatly improve your spray as well. 

2.) Spray
You will need to know how to spray to kill multiple targets. To learn your spray I would suggest these maps: ""Recoil Master"" and ""aim training v5d"" 
Video to watch: https://youtu.be/2ccJkM_1S8w

3.) Movement
Movement is just as important as your aim. On aim_botz no clip out into the area where the bots are and try and get headshots while always moving. Practice stopping yourself right before you shoot by hitting the direction key opposite to the way you're moving. This is what many people call stutter stepping. If you're moving right, tap A to stop yourself, and then shoot. This should all happen extremely fast and fluidly. If you master this people will call you hacker for getting what appears to be ""running"" headshots. Extremely important skill, always practice this. If your shots are inaccurate because of your movement you will lose no matter how good your aim is. 

4.) Positioning
To understand how you should be positioning yourself you need to play deathmatch. To do this, go into the community servers browser and find a deathmatch server by typing ""FFA"" or ""DM"" into the search box. Pay attention to how other people are standing and how they are peeking at you, and how they are moving. I think it's more worthwhile to play on a server with more players as you get more gunfights in shorter amount of time. Don't get frustrated if you get spawnkilled that's just the nature of having 20 players on a map designed for 5v5. Your score doesn't matter here... Obviously. It's about building your skill. In DM, you will also be practicing your aim, movement, &amp; spray as well since you're shooting and moving. (Duh) I DM every day pretty much until I get bored, usually 35 minutes or so. No need to go overkill.

5.) Map Knowledge/Game Sense
This sort of thing mostly comes with time but since you are a beginner I would try and just pick one map and try and master it first before you start playing everything. Pick a map, and look up videos on how to play every position on the map. When you are in a match and find yourself getting consistently wrecked by the other team, you might consider watching the demo (recording) of the match and paying close attention to what the other team is doing. To get better you just have to keep building reference experience, so play as much as you can and try and play the same positions over and over as well. Once you feel confident playing on one map, feel free to Branch out and learn the others. Avoid Nuke.

6.) Smokes
Smokes are extremely helpful but as a beginner you really should not worry about smokes and focus on your aim and movement. If you want, there are lots of videos on YouTube that contain tons of smokes on all the maps. But pretty much just focus on blocking off where your enemy is going to come from, or using them to create cover for yourself. Eventually as you rank up you will need to learn a lot of the more complex ones. You will be disadvantaged heavily if you don't. But in silver / gold Nova most people don't know smokes either so again you should primarily focus on your movement and aim. 

That's it for the daily practice stuff, some general tips for new players is to just focus on what your team is trying to accomplish and help them do that. If you notice your teammates are all towards A, don't be an idiot and go off on your own on the other side of the map. If you're flanking from the opposite bomb site odds are extremely likely your team will either be dead or have won the round by the time you make it back to the bombsite in a stealthy manner. Stay close to your teammates and if they go down, immediately try and kill the person who killed them. This is called trading. Always watch your teammates backs if there is a potential for them to get flanked. Communication is absolutely essential in csgo so always be relaying information on where the enemy is and what you hear. Pay close attention to your sound. Don't play with music. If you hear someone reloading or jumping or moving or whatever it can give you a massive advantage. I don't know how many times I've gotten a kill just because the idiot on the other team decided to reload at a bad time. When you get to site, plant the bomb as soon as possible. Once you get the bomb planted, don't crowd around the bomb. Cover all of the entrances that the enemy could realistically come from. If the last enemy was last spotted at B site on Mirage for example and the bomb is ticking down there is almost a 0% chance he comes from ramp or palace, and even if he does there is an even smaller chance that he kills everyone and has the time to defuse. If you know an enemy is in a certain spot, use a flashbang to blind him before peeking. You can use a grenade to make him move out, or a Molotov. Try and have your crosshair pointed at where the enemy will likely be or come from. When you have the bomb down, quit moving around and giving your positions away with your footsteps. If the enemy CTs are retaking the site force them to have to clear as many angles as possible. They are in a time crunch and will probably just run into site trying to get kills, which gives you a massive advantage. You can flash before they get to you and your whole team can peek together, or you can get lucky and kill him as he's clearing another spot, etc. Etc. So do not give away your advantage by making noise at all costs. Buy with your team. Always play to win, never throw your life away. Play to stay alive. That's about all I can think of for now. Best of luck welcome to CS

5,2018-12-25,u/RaptorPrime,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/a9dgmp/juan_deag/ecihwv2/,"All right, well, it's been a while since I've told this story so pull up a chair. First of all, his name was actually JuanDiego Montoya, he played for DIAF (Die in a Fire) and FOH (Flowers of Happiness). He just showed up on the scene at a South California LAN that I worked at one day. I remember the first time this kid walked into the place. I say walked but I swear it kind of looked like he was floating on air. He was wearing this weirdass grey gui and sandals. His eyes looked like they were burning red but you could tell it was from no sleep and too much CRT. He didn't really 'talk' so much as he communicated through a series of facial expressions. Anyway, this kid walks over to the counter, buys an all-day pass, 4 bowls of kimchi, 4 cans of arizona ice tea, and looks directly at me and says (and I say 'says' but I swear he didn't actually use words) ""Valar Morghulis"". Well this was weird as fuck because only a week earlier, the local sponsor for the big $5,000 LAN we were hosting had pulled me aside and told me that a fucked up kid might show up and ask to register a 1-man team for the tournament. He told me that the kid would say the phrase ""Valar Morghulis"" and that I should register his 1-man team, despite our rules.

The first game JD (as those of us who knew him call him) played was on de_inferno. He literally sat in spawn the entire T half and allowed the CTs to 14-0. On the 15th round, he bought for the first time: a desert eagle, a grenade, no armor. He then threw the grenade directly in front of himself and naded down to half hp, then typed ""Hello. My name is JuanDiego Montoya. You killed my brother. Prepare to die."" Next thing I know, this kid bunnyhops up T-ramp, up the ladder, quick deags two mid awpers, bunnyhops down to Mexico and gets two Banana pusher with one taps, and now with 2 rounds left, he shoots one off in the sky and starts yelling at the top of his lungs ""VALHALLLLLAAAAA"" and just runs straight up mid towards the last dude who is now trying to rotate through boiler. Now this last dude was actually one of the only known players to ever master the complete recoil pattern of the para. His name was Johnny R and one time we actually calculated that he could compensate for about 97% of the para recoil... and he had a para! Well JD pushed out of mid exactly as Johnny R pushed out of boiler, Johnny R quickswitches to para and starts letting out the sickest para spray I have ever seen, like 100% accuracy to JD's dome. And then, the incident. Few counter strike players know this, but back in 1.6, you could actually anti-recoil an opponent. Basically, if you could do a pixel perfect opposite movement of the recoil pattern your opponent was inputting, the game essentially ""blocked"" that specific bullet from registering. So as Johnny R is emptying the entire para clip at JD and hitting 100% recoil compensation accuracy, JD is hitting 100% anti-recoil. It was some crazy shit to watch. Then you hear Johnny R's ""click click click"" and JD quickswitches from knife (you need to have knife out to anti-recoil) to the desert eagle, and with the last bullet, he one taps Johnny R.

Entire LAN is quiet for 7 full seconds. Count out to 7 right now... that's a long ass time. Then, before any of us have a chance to say anything, we realize that the round hasn't ended for some reason... behind JD, something spawned in Mexico. I can't tell you exactly what because all I could see was a bright white light on my screen... but I looked over to the JD's screen and his was the only one that actually showed this demon looking creature with a sceptre. JD needs to reload, demon is rushing at him, instead of bunny hopping away or going down with his knife, he starts to type out ""JAB JAB FORWARD JAB FIERCE"" in all caps into the console. Everyone's screens go black, flicker 5 times, and then light up again. JD was gone. The map was set to de_dust for some reason but in T spawn, beside a dead terrorist body, there was a chest. I looted it real quick and held onto it for years. Then, one day, I randomly thought about trying a CS GO operation key on the chest. And that's how I got my Deagle Diego Hellfire (tagged Unique, No Drop, No Loot, No Trade, No Rent, No Screenshot)."

1,2018-12-28,u/digiocky,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/aa4xpx/how_can_i_improve_my_aim/ecpmzuf/,"Ok so not many people know this. 400 dpi is true dpi making &gt; 800 is (2x 400) and 1600 is (4x 400.) Its an emulated mouse acceleration, a gimmick they invented to sell ""high quality mice.""

I would first remove all mouse acceleration from the computer, google &gt; mouse acceleration remover.

400 dpi is what you should set your mouse to and anyone telling you what input number in csgo is a moron. The sensitivity number should relate to your resolution you are using. And if you really want to be technical your FPS as well. 

Ok here is how you determine your sensitivity. Load up a solo map anything were you can mess around in without trolls killing you. Now find a spot with key positions such as dust 2 A bomb sight. Now face a typical direction and naturally flick to long a or ramp or cat walk. What part of your arm did you use? Was it the whole arm or just your wrist? There are two movements in aim. The arm which is going to be your around the corner aim, or the wrist, the flick shot and spray aim. You want to mess around in the sensitivity until your wrist movement only takes up 90 degrees of rotation meaning your wrist moment should represent your screens resolution. And your arm moment should be a full 360. 

Here are a few helpful videos that go into more detail 

https://youtu.be/wqZRpVz-u2Y n0thing

https://youtu.be/ooAxzbGUCZA Rez

Both are filled with quality knowledge.

After you get your sensitivity down it's all about timing. Most shots should not be moving flicks they should be pre determined shots that have been set up. That's why flicks get such a big reaction, they are hard to do, and if you are flicking alot you are setting yourself up to fail. 

Something I always say: ""Aim small miss small""
https://youtu.be/L8FTbA38yuc

A really really weird but accurate way to get insanely good aim is to stop looking at the aim ridicul all together and instead learn to bring the focus of the middle of the screen to what you are aiming at. Try removing your ridicul all together and use nothing. You will be surprised at how well you can still aim. It will show you how much your brain naturally lines up shots.

Lastly over thinking is causing you to not hit shots. Just shoot once its 100% on the head. A good way to practice this is do a death match server and just place your aim on people's head and dont shoot. Once you have trolled them finally take your shot. 

It takes time, and honestly you would be better learning something better then playing a video game."

&amp;#x200B;

At one point for a while the veteran gamers can argue this Counter Strike was like super cheap - you bought it once, installed it, played with friends either LAN or the WEB..

&amp;#x200B;

Skins and money and hacking and credit cards ha.. I mean when did this game become the exact experience people get when going to a shopping mall during the holidays?

&amp;#x200B;

I loved adding my real life job money debit card to my game account and buying keys - about as much gambling as I do. Seeing what CSGO turned into before it became ""Free to Play"" is the reason why I stopped spending money on the game entirely.  The skins could've been more easily attainable to players who just enjoy putting the hours in, the Marketplace should not be a forced location to visit when you want to get new skins, you should've been able to find them more in game based on your ability and achievements, as well as just because earning shit it fun.

Everyone has their reasons why they stop playing this game as it's ""updated"" and you have to wonder if there are other games out there more worth your time and energy? Some of the best games yet to come are about to open beta soon and all this raw user data people like yourself and the veteran users here at CSGO will be more than paid back once the new version of Counter Strike comes out once again. I've seen this shift before when a popular game from a difference franchise is released Steam would rather give the game away for free to show players what an FPS should be more like rather than see kids get trapped in that Fortnite life. 

This game was probably not trying to create a dark web in itself - but shit happens when you give kids access to this kind of ""entertainment"" so be critical of the games unlimited freedoms rather than the lack of scrutiny and security. The Game Maker people are probably doing their best and are blown away just as much as you or I are at how chaotic the users are."

Lower your sensitivity to something that feels uncomfortably slow and force yourself to get used to it. Crosshair placement is key, make sure you aren't looking at the ground try to aim around head level. Keep a mental note of what weapons the enemy has so you can predict thier next plays. If you hear or see an awp do not slow peak. Buy lots of tactical and learn how to use them (YPRAC has training for aim and tactical). Know when to save don't buy cheaper weapons unless you have to. Communication is the most important part of csgo and it's important to make callouts of what you see. Give your team the location and the weapon of the guys you see. M4A1-s is really accurate but if you're having issues with aiming the M4A4 acts very similar to the AK-47. do most of your aim practise with the M4's, the AK and the AWP. the AWP might be intimidating but its really just as easy as point and click. Learn to be patient, don't give the enemy any more information than you have to. Wait for pushes and aim for head level. Finally if you can find a group of players that you atleast have fun playing with it becomes so much better than solo queue. "

Next you most likely need to work on crosshair placement. Never stare at the ground since shooting your enemies feet is pointless. Try to aim at chest level at first and once you can consistently do that while running around; change to aiming for the head or upper neck. You can practice this by spawning in to a offline deathmatch against harmless bots. Enable console in settings, push the key (top left of keyboard underneath esc), type 

bot_stop 1

mp_roundtime 60

bot_kick all

bot_add t four times if you are a CT or bot_add ct if you are a terrorist

mp_restartgame 1

Now go around to different altitudes of the map like stairs and flat surfaces.

At each four different, nearby, changes in elevation stand on one and type either bot_place ct if you are a terrorist or bot_place t if you are a CT. Practice keeping your crosshair at chest to head level on the bots as you move around.

Now to practice shooting type bot_stop 0 and practice tap firing the bots to death and once you get decent at that start burst firing them with two bullets at a time. Once you can do two change to three than to four.

If you can burst the bots effeciently now you can try to headshot. Aim for the head than shoot. It's really difficult at first but do it enough and it becomes a reflex. To practice try typing host_timescale .5 or lower which slows tome to half. 

That should be a really good start if you practice that for a day or two. Then you should be good enough to practice against real players in death match.

-A somewhat decent keyboard (multiple keys at once work properly)

128 Tick Servers:
Would be great!


Overwatch:
Overwatch Should be available from Silver 4 if you have 150wins up. Players who have too many mistakes  in their cases should be getting a ban  for like 30 days. So the number of cheaters would fall rapidly. 

Keys:
Keys for cases are to Expensive when you open a case you very rarely get something good  I would suggest to low the price to 1 euro (dollar). I know the steam market would fall insanely fast but more and more cases are not good for the community only for valves profit 

Ranking system:
Ranking up is nothing special because it's boring to rank up. You don't get anything. I would make more ranks and I would give people good skins  (not p250 sand dune) after every 6-12 competitive game

Bhoping:
Bhoping Is dead in competitive servers. Skill-based movement is important in css and should be in Csgo too.

Anti cheat:
 trust factor and vac is a good combo but I hope you guys at valve improve that  in 2019 much more. Because now cheaters cheat days and they doesn't get banned. Vac and trust factor Have potential uses it!



Please make something don't make new cases and stuff like that we need game improvements not more and more expensive skins.

When I started playing i played with moise acceleration. You can't build proper muscle memory with that, since the speed at which you drag your mouse affects how far you will look to the side. Maybe muscle memory is the keyword for you. Also try joining lobbies that have an average skillgrouo maybe 3 or 4 ranks above yours.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with using a scope (i mean the awp also has one... so am I a cod noob for using awp??? no im not).

When shooting the aug, burst or tap fire at longer distances and spray on close quarters. Good positioning is also a key factor. Use cover as much as possible."

7,2019-01-22,u/Waste_District,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/aif3pf/how_to_get_out_of_silver/eenngdn/,"Ok. As you're solo queueing, it's literally a crap shoot (no pun intended!) Used to be MGE but one of my friends inv a hacker so I got put down to N4 and only just worked back up to MG1 :/

Try to find where you go wrong. Chased a kill round a corner and died? Keep running into prenades? Just not aiming well? Try to find what you can do better and concentrate on what you could try to do better (far too easy to get tilted at other people if you let yourself :/ )

I've heard people say they top frag or second every game a lot. I find that hard to believe, but I've never been in silver so I wouldn't know.

It's important to note a few things: 

-It's better to have a 1/2/3 games a day rather than ten in one go. You will rank up better/faster (as well as play better for those games.) 

-Do. Not. Leave. Games... Ever. It not only hurts your rank, but it hurts your trust factor. Losing a match doesn't matter, losing rounds does. So if you lose 14/15 rounds and want to leave, don't bother. You'll hurt your rank and TF more than if you just lose normally. (not saying you do this, but SO MANY people don't realise the loss of a match doesn't matter as much as the rounds.)

-lower your mouse sens. I have about 1.1 with 800 dpi on mouse. Seriously. It's great. It'll feel weird, but you will find you start owning so much more (at least I did!)

-If you can, play with at least one friend sometimes. If you can't get strats going with your team, you are at a massive disadvantage. 


Ok, now I'll try to run down some general things that can help. Don't know if they apply to you but for the sake of advice:

-**always aim where the enemies heads will be** Doesn't matter where you are or how many are left. Get into the habit, this is key to getting great consistency. In csgo, consistency is king.

-Don't just run into the enemy unless you have someone to trade you. Be patient and get used to playing the right angles with the right weapons. Don't hold short B to top mid with a bizon or shotgun. You're just playing with luck. 

-Stop walking, then shoot. I've seen people panic and just run around spraying. ''23 in 1 hit'' is what you'll see. Once you have that down, then work in jiggle strafing.

-Are you king of the pistol rounds? I look at my past matches, if I don't get at least 1 kill in each, then I am the problem. Do not buy a pistol. Use your starter pistol and aim for the head. It takes 1 shot. Once you have that consistently then you can get fruity with your 1st round buys.

-You're in silver so I don't know how the ''feel'' goes but try to get used to when people will rush or when people's economies are fucked. Buy together as a team. Stress the power of economy and the power of the 1st round bomb plant. Watch warowls vids on economy, it makes sense. If you sense they're gonna rush, hold back, wait for the nades and wait for the rush. Don't get greedy. 

-If you tilt, take a moment out and breathe. I just had a game today where a guy had like 2-3 kills after ten rounds. He was apologising, we just said ''no worries mate'' and he came back second half and just started started popping off. We were 4 players v 5 (a guy left 2 rounds in when we lost, idiot) and we went from like 3-12 to them to a 16-14 win to us (the last few rounds were tense!). If we turned round to him and starting throwing shade at him he probably wouldn't have done that well. Mind state is important! So is being friendly when you can easily be a dick!

-concise comms. Let's say you are stairs on CT and get killed by an awp from palace. An example is ''1 palace, hit 45'' Boom. Done. No more. MAYBE say they have an awp (but that will be obvious) try to say your shit and let the rest go for it. 

-Ranking up is hard, but getting over the silver/nova and nova/mg threshold is much harder than say nova 2 to 3. Keep trying for that consistency.

-hmmm, what else.... I've just typed this in a few minutes so it probs won't be the best. Ill try to find a couple of pages for you written by people who have thought this out more. Ill edit it in.

If you think of any specific questions you want to ask, go for it man. I'll try my best to offer my noob advice lol




(Edit: [These are the pages I actually used when I started out along with warowls videos](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=401320446),

It's very likely that you are not ranked too high if you have decent gamesense and aim, but you could be getting put up against: smurfs (higher level players playing on lower ranked accounts), hackers, people with thousands of hours stuck in gn4, and otherwise. 

As others have stated practice and learning the basics is key. As you solidify that knowledge and grow as a player you will find yourself fitting in more for your level. Practice on the workshop map aim_botz and watch some videos on smokes and flashes for a variety of maps. Queue certain maps until you get the spots and calls down. Practice movement etc. 

It will take a lot of work to get decent at the game and even more to get good. If you are looking for an fps timesink you have found it my friend.

Also, the community can be toxic. Try playing with friends or find them here. It's a lot better that way."

3,2019-01-30,u/TheTalkingKeyboard,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/albdl1/how_to_get_better/efckxe2/,"Sorry for the wall of text... You asked a lot of questions.

&amp;#x200B;

I think you're kinda over-doing things a little, and you're asking a *lot* of questions, making this all rather hard to follow. Lets start from the top

Don't put too much time into prefires and peeks until you're much better at the game. If you're looking to peek something quickly and rattle off a few shots or maybe snap to someone, you need better movement. I dunno what your movement is like, but you need a pretty good grasp on how to stop-shoot and such before you get into prefiring. Prefires are fast; can your movement skill match that?

Learning nades is great, and you should definitely work on them! I'm mostly a fan of flashbangs, and have recently been hitting 20+ EF in most of my MM and Faceit games (Legendary Eagle MM), with everyone else usually topping out with an average of 5 EF, with some better players heading towards 12. Smokes are your second best friend aside flashes in my eyes, although with you being GN in MM, I find it hard to believe that your team will wait for you to throw it; let alone cover you whilst doing so. Lower ranked people also have a tendency to just run through smokes anyways. Maybe flashes would be more useful, but you'll just get shouted at with ""why you flash me man!"" or ""stop flashing"" because your team looks into the flash; despite you communicating it.

Reviewing demos after your matches may be good, but also very time-consuming. I'd recommend just remembering your mistakes and working off of them. If you do decide to continue reviewing your own demos, I really wouldn't bother analyzing anyone but yourself at these ranks.

You ask a lot about ""How much; when; where; what"" in regards to practicing. You seem really devoted, and I respect it, but don't wear yourself out. Doing too much might just tire you out and could possibly make you perform worse; and that's what it comes down to at the end of the day: performance in-game. Maybe spend at max an hour before a match warming up.   
Spend 30 minutes working on the strategic and gamesense side of the game; do nades and some prefires here; walk round some corners and shoot at exactly where you'd think someone might be and make sure the bullet goes straight (don't do prefire maps here; load up a local casual without bots and run around the map prefire-checking anything you feel would be appropriate, whilst also being considerate of all angles.   
Then spend 30 minutes on your aim. Load up a FFA server and get ready to get de\_stroyed by all the people that are probably better than you (I know the feeling). The best part about it is when you kill them, or even when you go on a little rampage. Outside of FFA, use maps like aim\_botz and [training\_aim\_csgo2](https://steamcommunity.com/id/TalkingKeyboard/myworkshopfiles/?appid=730&amp;browsefilter=mysubscriptions) to really get a feel for your mouse (the latter is my favorite!)

How to stop crouching when shooting.. Well, it depends on when you're crouching. I often crouch when spraying, with one reason being that it forces your opponent to adjust their crosshair. Crouching at the right time may just yield you the kill. Crouching can kill you, though, due to the movement impediment.

How to improve movements and stutter stepping: This all links back to the prefire stuff I mentioned previously. It's all about being able to successfully stop and regain accuracy. If you're not doing this already: Aim at a wall, don't move your mouse and shoot once to make a marker. Strafe out to the left; stop; shoot; move back to the middle; stop; shoot. This is a pretty good routine that you could do for 5 or so minutes *before* doing the casual prefire thing I mentioned.

How to kill an awper camping: That really depends on the situation and also *really* depends on yours and your opponent's skill. Utility tends to be key here; going in dry might just get you killed; depending on who you're up against. Stop-shooting might just really help you here; especially if you align your crosshair up perfectly and hit a good prefire. Going back a little: I'd also suggest learning how to shoot in the correct location when it's smoked off: A good spam or tap through the smoke might just net you the kill if you know where you're looking.

Music is personal preference I think.

Personally, watching pros play won't do *too* much for you unless you're playing against people with a similar level of gamesense to you. The issue here is that no matter how smart you may be, if the enemy doesn't know what they're doing, you'll not be able to read or predict their plays. I personally watch Tarik's videos a lot, and that's somewhat added to the list of plays I know of, and has certainly changed the way I read situations, although I wouldn't rely on observing pro-level gameplay until you're at a similar level yourself.   
It's really all about thinking about what's happening right now. Where are you? Where's the bomb? Where are your opponents last seen? What gun did they have? Are they hit? How many players are alive? Do you have nades? Where can you go? What should you clear? Will they push you?... Lots of variables, and there are ***many*** more. In every situation, you need to think about probability: figure out what the most probable play from them is, and then think about what play is most probable to win *you* the round.

Bad habits.. Don't under-estimate your enemies; don't over-face. I'm terrible with this. Defending B as a CT on Inferno; I tend to swing out from CT spawn on pistol rounds; maybe get 1 or two, and then get rushed down. Unless I'm being flashed in at the exact correct time to catch at least 3T players in this situation: I'm going to die; I'm going to get traded within (at maximum) 2 seconds, when playing Retake and backing out would almost always be the most effective play to make.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this may somewhat help. I also hope multiple people see this...

Couple of things that have massively helped me improve my games;

Learning spray patterns. 
Download a spray training map and get used to handling that spray, memorise it for your most frequently used guns At close/med range it's key to consistent fragging. 

Learning to hold and peak/not peak angles. 
This is something that I'm still working on a lot, that is super important to CSGO. WarOwl does some good videos on this particularly about when you're visible and when you're not and between you, the angle, and your opponent how to take the advantage when peaking. Another key is when NOT to peak, how to take the off angle and how to play and angle. WarOwl and NadeKing are good YouTubers for this stuff. 

Playing with a friend that is better than you. 
One of my pals is a lot better than me and it's really helped me in terms of map sense, learning callouts and reading the opponent plays. This has been a great help to me. So befriend someone better than you and learn from them. 

Learning the economics. 
I'm shit at eco. Or rather I used to be. But keeping a few figures in mind can really help. Like how much a full buy will cost. How much a pistol round loss/win/x2 kills will net you. What the rewards are related to each win conditions for both teams. This enables you to predict for instance when the opposing team might carry and AWP for instance, when to eco, when to throw a round in hopes of winning the next etc. Or how to stop a win condition for the opposing team to put them at a eco disadvantage. 

Most important... 
Have fun and don't take it too seriously. Relax, get on the mic, be vocal, talk to your teammates, make callouts, have a laugh, have a good round, have a bad round, take it as it comes.

post)Global/Faceit level9 (I rarely play anymore) but one thing I wanted to mention is what you are describing doesn’t change. You can be high elo and still experience these kinds of people, you need to develop the right attitude towards losing.

If you lose and start going “WELL I ONLY LOST CAUSE MY TEAM DID...” Then you will continue to lose, at GN2 all the way up to global you don’t need teamwork, learn to flash for yourself, time your utility read your opponent from just the round timer and sounds(nades, smokes across the map etc)

Also if you practice for 2-4 hours of DM. Stop. Cause you can’t keep that up consistently, it’s like exercise consistency is key. You can go hard as fuck and lift insane weights, completely tear your body up but you probably won’t be able to do that everyday. Compared to the guy who is pushing it but not much and doing it everyday, he’ll have more volume.

So with aim practice, do an hour (bots, if you do DM becareful of FPS as if you lose a hundred FPS in DM servers your aim won’t be the same) practice something you are shit at (Tracking, Flicks, Spray control/transfer, movement, strafe shooting, jiggle etc etc) [https://youtu.be/ooAxzbGUCZA](https://youtu.be/ooAxzbGUCZA) \- Rez does a great short video that will help.

I’ll be honest I’ve been through what you are saying, I couldn’t rank up at all when I started (I hated the game only played due to friends) I would constantly get team mates that would cry, scream, kick people, no coms, afk, troll and I’d blame them for my loss. Now you can say it is partly there fault butttt if you take this as seriously as you say you do, then you should be looking back and say why you lost maybe you missed a shot that could of made it 3-2 instead of 2-2 and giving them the site. Maybe you had no utill to hold off a rush (SO IMPORTANT NOT TO WASTE UTILL) Your team mates may lose you silly rounds but you might lose them important rounds, when the economy round is in flux and that round decides who gets the lead economically.

TL;DR - You spend too much time worrying about your RANDOM teammates who you won’t play with again, focus on your game and your mistakes not there’s. If the game gets too much for you, TAKE A BREAK. A month off can do wonders, won’t make you rank up but it will clear your mind.

I’m in traffic and hella bored

[https://youtu.be/kdKq1j5L8AY](https://youtu.be/kdKq1j5L8AY) \- FalleN Roles video is insaneeeely good to watch even if you aren’t in a team. It’s fundementals.

Also if you are tilted you are tensing up while aiming, gotta be loosey goosey. How many times ya reckon that’s missed you a kill and be honest! It’s lost me duels LOADS of times haha

If you win consistently, then you are going to rank up. This may seem like a drag, but after you move to gn2, you will rank up to gn3 faster if you keep winning. The system will start setting you against higher ranked opponents and saddle you with equal or lower ranked opponents because it wants you to start losing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Or rather, it expects that you lose against higher ranked opponents. If you win those games, then your rating increases by a better margin. If you start losing against higher ranked opponents, then you won't lose a lot of ranking 'points' but the system will start giving you easier opponents and so those wins won't matter as much again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Somewhere in the thread you said you are playing with friends. I am not sure how CSGO handles ranking with parties, but I do know that some games tend to reduce the 'ranking points' for wins. "

1.) Communication is always key in those situations. When the enemy does something or u hear someone reload or switch weapons that’s not ur teammate, call it out 

2.) Spacing, they also use this in the military too, when ur all together like that, the team risks all getting shot or naded

3.) Playing on information. When ur teammate pushes and dies or takes shots, they either say the general area or u ask them where they got shot from if they don’t immediately tell the team; this kind of goes with communication but whatever

4.) Using ur utilities. Mirage is a hard map to play without using smokes and flashes, there’s a lot of pinch zones on that map so knowing smoke spots is really helpful

5.) Teamwork, it’s communication but also a little bit of synergy involved too. U can’t be real greedy in this game or u will die a lot so work with ur team for the objective and try to trade kills so it’s not always a 1v3"

One important point is that a number of Iranian players in the esea are colluding and easily wins $ 200 items.

The name of the player z4pheX

[https://play.esea.net/users/1663591](https://play.esea.net/users/1663591)

He earned a $ 200 prize last month by colluding with his teammates. Their way to win is to oppose the team and the very weak game will defeat their team and win the team and win the same win.

If you know that Iranian players have 100+ pings on ES esea servers, except turkey.

In Turkish servers, Iranian players are under 70 years old, and the Turkish ESEA Association is very small, so if you play on the Turkish server, there is a lot of chance you can combine.

So these players are equal and they only raise one person for the prize.

You know,I haven’t been to Zoo for a long time,so at one moment remembered that there is an American web site called reddit and there are a lot of braindead people (Americans) which replace the real life zoo,so why do I need to waste my money when I can easily visit for free an American web site and watch the monkeys screaming and jumping around,but instead of pointing a middle to monkeys(the monkeys go crazy when you show the middle finger to them) you just say the simple things which are not acceptable in the USA,but for normal countries it would be ok and understandble.
About your advice,If I lived in the USA I would probably do that,because what’s the point working all the time hard as you can,then you live in a plastic house which costs around 1.000.000$ and eating only chemicals products which also makes you a little bit disable and after 2 weeks you’ll become a typical American(fat and stupid) and let’s talk about medication which costs a mount of money.If you brake something for example in Russia they’ll treat you for free while in the USA you would pay 3000$ or even more for a broken leg."

1. Drops at the end of games. You’re most likely going to get pretty low-tier skins without a good look from this way. You receive 2 skins and 2 cases from drops each week.

2. Cases. Opening cases can get you some really high tier and quality skins... If you’re extremely lucky. The case opening system does not have favourable odds to getting any high-tier skins. Keep it mind to open a case, you have to buy a key (Costs around $2.75 iirc).

3. Betting Sites. Highly not recommended and do not use if under 18. These sites are not favourable for your profit. They can be fun, but very rarely rewarding.

4. Steam Community Market/Bitskins. These are probably your best bet for buying skins. I’d personally suggest buying skins off of Bitskins as you’ll receive better deals and such.

-Am I taking the right routes?

-Am I planting in a good spot?

-Am I making good use of the info I have? 

-Do I have good crosshair placement? 

-Am I obvious and expectable? 

You'll instantly see improvement once you start to acknowledge your mistakes. 

For aim, buy a decently sized mousemat. Make sure your pad is at least 25cm wide (45cm is recommended). Then follow this guide to find your perfect sensitivity: https://youtu.be/uxBuiD11WDM After finding a good sensitivity practice on deathmatch for 15 minutes once every morning before your comp games and once after your comp games. Try not to go higher than 1600eDPI (eDPI = sens * DPI, e.g. 2.5 * 400 = 1000eDPI) and try not to go lower than 800eDPI (in my opinion you should only go lower than 800eDPI if you have a great team and if you don't play entry frag). Getting used to a lower sensitivity is key to improving your accuracy and landing more frags. 

Also, try to stand still when you shoot, your bullets will be very inaccurate if you move. Once you get better you'll learn how to counterstrafe/stutter stepping (quickly stand still after strafing a distance, this means you can move to dodge bullets whilst also keeping accuracy)

For movement, play CSGO surf to learn how to strafe properly and to improve your coordination. 

A good YouTuber to learn from is LuckySkillFaker. He can teach you a lot about the game. 

You'll know when you improved when you start being more consistent. Once you have improved, it's time to find a team! Gamerlink is a good app to find a team on but I recommend using the in-game LFG function or add people who are friendly. You *must* remember that a person doesn't have to be good for you to add him. You can add a bad player and improve at the game with him, this will make the game much more enjoyable rather than adding a good sweaty player which will spend half his time raging and complaining about how he carried you and still lost. 

Also, CSGO's ELO system is a strange one. It rewards you more based on consecutive days over consecutive matches. For example: Let's say I won 7 matches in one day and I get 100 ELO (not accurate, just example). If I won 1 match per day for a week (7 matches total) I would get 150 ELO (not accurate, just example). So try to split your sessions across days rather than grinding in one day then skipping 2 days after. 

One final tip, be sure to have fun. Wanting to win is ok but expecting to win will only frustrate you. Staying calm and relaxed is key to performing as best as you can. Play a lot too, practice makes perfect. If you're doing good but still can't get out of S2 then it's time to make a new account.

EDIT: I completely forgot to add map knowledge. To learn maps you want to watch YouTube and streams. Also make sure you only play active duty maps and Cache (the maps with a blue/orange symbol at the top left). You will see these maps in tournaments which means you can learn very cool tricks and nades on them (you won't see Cache but Cache is just a great map to play, and they'll probably add it back into active duty after some balancing changes)

That's the end of this. Best of luck with your games and I hope to see you out of silver 2 soon! :)

My sens is 2.5 @ 400DPI if you just want to copy that rather than doing perfect sensitivity approximation (which can be very boring and tedious)."
1,2019-05-22,u/SirShlonger,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/briilf/na_gn_coaching_silvers_for_free/eoff9iu/,"Damn well I already typed out all of this so here you go for your previous comment: 

Ah yeah that's a good one. Nothing better than a nice clean 1 tap, but in my experience, striving for 1 taps all the time isn't the best mind set. Being able to control the spray of your gun will effectively double your skill in the game. Assuming your crosshair placement is already decent, if you have control of the spray, the bullets will eventually find their way to the enemy's head. There's a really good workshop map to learn spray control, with a decent amount of practice of course. 

Another thing that I learned way back is that I never had the right sensitivity for me. A good tip is to go to an aim map with bots, and try flicking to their heads with an ak or something, even a pistol. You'll notice that you'll either be over shooting, or under shooting quite a bit. You can adjust your sensitivity accordingly. 

Finally, when I was first starting out, playing in silver and gold nova I was always aiming just a little too low. Even now when I'm playing in gold nova on an alt with my friends, I notice them and many other gold novas are also aiming just a little too low, around neck and upper chest level. When fixing this for myself, I remember it feeling real uncomfortable, but when I would force myself to aim higher than I thought was right, I was more likely to hit headshots. 

All in all, when looking for headshots, crosshair placement and sensitivity is key. Knowing where the enemy's head will be, and having a sensitivity comfortable enough to be allmake small adjustments in aim when your target actually does present itself. Remember to stay relaxed, stay focused, and stay patient, and you'll be hitting headshots in no time. Best of luck!"

Trigger bot is easy to detect. They are mostly awpers with insane reactions that hit you the exact moment you shoulder peak, or they do insane peaks that will kill you before you even see them. These awpers usually have scores like 27-2, 24-1 etc.

Rage botters. These exist in prime and are usual. Similar to aimbot but you bind it to a key. This is what switching is all about. You press that key and you instantly headshot the opponent closer to your crosshair. Can't be exploited because it can be easily found by overwatch. Biggest giveaway is when theyvuse awp. You'll just see then getting every awp kill with headshot and on top of that point black rage shots gonna be also headshot. Another giveaway is when you shoot them from the back and just turn around one tapping you(after the have one tapped your entire team). They usually start with insanely bad scores. They will have many bad rounds and many times you'll ask yourself how this guy is first from the enemy and how he one tapped you 3-4 rounds in a row. 

Aimlockers. You hold a key and the crosshair locks to your opponents head as long as you hold it. They are the same as the rage otters, but easier to deal with most of the time. 

Facelaggers, are people with perfect ping that appear to your screen like they lag so you can't easily kill them. Vac can't easily locate it so it's almost unpunishable. 

Recoiless, you have absolute no recoil to your weapons. Used more rarely than the others. Dead giveaway is if the player has hit many jumpshots always run/shoots, and some people that peak while running right or left but shotting at the same time headshot ting your whole team. 
Easilly punishable by overwatch. People are too cautious with it. 

Radar hackers. Be careful those are extremely usual, hard to catch, almost never punishable. They absolute see everything in the radar. Usually this comes with a wh package. The giveaway is if the same guy always camps always the perfect spot in which your team attacks, or rushes your whole team by throwing perfect nades round after round(obviously if he does it 2-3 times that doesn't mean he is radar hacking, but if he done it like 10 times then you should maybe start thinking about it). 

Finally, wall hack. Extremely common in many tiers. Easy to understand who is using it by his amount of prefires. You'll probably see them prefiring broken(dead) angles, extremely unusual spots that are hard to guess, and generally making insane prefires in spots that they have 0 info for. If you call them out for it they will say some random ass bullshit(mostly sound, even though they prefire exactly the spot you are standing, exactly on your head) and this is because they wanna make it legit to their teammates that are watching. It's easy to make this hack look legit and is rarely punishable. Worst hack of them all by far. 

And aim bitters that you rarely see nowadays because they are soo easily detectable by vac and overwatch that are banned after 10 hours at most. 

PS: I tried these hacks with a group of friends the other day(my friend's pc) in a temporal account that we made just to see how they really work. We spent around 8 euros iirc. They usually come into packages. I never use cheats in my main account and I believe anyone who uses them is a fucking trash human being. Since I tested these hacks it's a lot easier to identify who is a good player and who is using cheats and hacks. My point is that mm is still fully infested with hackers, they are less than before, but they are still there. The obvious aimbotters seem to be extremely reduced from prime mm tho."

&amp;#x200B;

Closet cheating is cheating with the minimum amount of assistance. To closet cheat you at least need a bit of skill and knowledge of the game. If you have played the game legit over 100+ hours you can closet cheat easily. Now this is why closet cheating is fun to people who wants clout. They look legit while they're cheating. There are streamer options of cheats which hides the UI of the cheat for OBS or NVIDIA GTX recorder (whatever that called).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As I said I don't closet cheat and I only cheat at community hack versus hack servers but I know how to not get banned while closet cheating. I have over 500 hours on multiple accounts and I can play with minimum assistance and no wallhacks. I know grenade/smoke spots and many other things. Most important part of hiding your cheats is your crosshair placement and movement. Not saying that you need to bhop all the time just learn how to walk and avoid bumping into walls everytime. If you make your cheats too obvious and if everyone in the game reports you just stop playing for that day. You only show up in OW if you have 10+ reports in a day.

&amp;#x200B;

How to spot a cheat:

They usually hit double bhops everytime. Some don't strafe so you can report them for sure. A normal player can't hit double or singe bhops everytime, that's impossible. Or  just watch their movement overall. If you're in lem elo and that person walks like a retarded, report.

&amp;#x200B;

Watch their crosshair placement and compare it with their frags.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Most of them trash talk a lot. This doesn't mean the person is cheating but if you think he is cheating and if he's toxic consider watching him more focused.

&amp;#x200B;

Watch if they oneway on a wallbang spot and hit someone everytime. A normal player wouldn't risk spoiling their position just for a wallbang.

&amp;#x200B;

And look at their profiles. It's probably hidden or just the hours hidden but if it's not hidden and if person has decent amount of hours look at their friends list, groups, comments, previous aliases. If you find something suspicious report. Don't get fooled by their inventories if they got very expensive skins. Zuhn got banned several times with loads of knives.

&amp;#x200B;

The keywords you need to be searching:

&amp;#x200B;

Skeet, AW, OT, Onetap, Aimware, Fanta, Paste, HvH.

&amp;#x200B;

If they have a friend with these keywords on their profiles they're %100 cheating no way they're legit. Normal people wouldn't add HvH players, infact they hate them."

Learning the callouts is key to letting your teammates where the enemies are. Usually in the lower ranks especially half of everyone there doesn't have a mic or speaks English. So gathering a few friends who might be new to cs or decent so that you make sure to have good teammates. I learned callouts on 6 different maps by watching pro games and listening to the casters

2. Learn the basic weapons
Knowing how to use normal weapons like the AK, AWP and the USP and maybe an SMG is a good thing so you know a variety of weapons for a variety of scenarios. I'd recommend the weapons I just mentioned and the Glock for t-side pistol rounds.

3. Know basic nade-throws
Knowing throws like the 3 usually thrown on A on mirage is usually where most people start. You can look up ""how to execute A on mirage"" on YouTube. And then extend your knowledge to flashbangs and molotovs and eventually other maps.

4. Find community maps for aim and nade-throws. I personally use Yprac. Just search for it on the workshop

I hope this worked :)"

Also I've noticed Cs go is the type of game you have to play almost everyday to improve. Even if I'm off for a week or two it takes several days of playing just to get back to where I was. And the longer the break the longer it takes. Another thing is to learn how to get into bombsites, typically you don't always want to rush and you def don't peak without a flash or some smoke set up. And always set up trade kills like you rush out first or your teammate but quickly have the other person be out too to get that trade. And as a ct if you just hold angles and put up smokes or mollies and never rush you can get to gold nova 4 pretty quick. The key is just thinking about what you're doing as a T and as a CT just hold. Of course it gets more complicated as you get higher up but just that can get you to mg.

Edit: for me I noticed I would improve best if I played like 3-5 hours straight and much more. If you only play 1 game per day you don't really warm up and condition that muscle memory. You literally have to play 5+ hours hah"

Slowly until it feels right. After that, make sure that when peeking a corner, to know your angles, and peek one small portion of that corner at a time using strafe only. Then when you peek out, counter your movement with the opposite strafe key. So if you're a CT on Dust2 at peeking long coming from CT, you should peek the left side of long first, using just the A key, and if you're gonna fire, you just quickly tap D, and then fire at the same time to get perfect accuracy when you pull the trigger.

1.	Don't get invested in what others say, don't respond in a negative way and honestly, just don't respond to any toxicity. 
2.	Enable any sort of 2FA you can for your accounts. Steam has steam guard and many other sites use Google Authenticator. 
3.	Don't cheat, at all. Not only is it extremely rude to cheat, the small amount of happiness you would get from the one win won't be worth it compared to legitimate wins. 
4.	Make sure you have a reliable mouse, headset, and a decent keyboard. Everyone will have their own preference in these, but I recommend a mouse with less macro buttons, such as the G403. For a headset I prefer HyperX on the higher end, but the G430 is pretty good for the price, just never use the USB sound card that is included. 
5.	For in game settings, I'd recommend sticking with your native resolution for the time being. Now for your sensitivity, I'd recommend an eDPI in the 700-1500 range, but this is completely up to you. To find what feels nice with you, I recommend starting with an eDPI of 1200 and changing it to whatever feels good. I used to increment my changes in large jumps, but I get used to New sensitivity quickly. Players such as woxic play amazingly well with an eDPI of 3200 and this is because of my next point. 
6.	Consistency. The key to getting better at any game is consistency. This can be as little as 10 minutes of aim practice before you play, to having the same schedule everyday, like getting home from school, do homework, play for 3 hours, eat dinner, sleep. This all depends on the type of player you are. 
7.	Make sure you keep an eye on your real life. I understand using videogames as an escape, but if your grades start suffering or your work performance drops, prioritize those instead. 
8.	If you really want to get good quickly, then I have some maps I would recommend you use. The maps I mostly use would be the YPRAC set of maps by Yesber. His maps have many routines to help you learn the mechanics of CS:GO, but most skill comes by just playing the game. 

That's all I can really think of for now, but if you have any questions, you can ask me here or add me on steam at steamcommunity.com/id/rustiii or on Discord at rusti#0001"

Also my ping was usually 110-140 (now 90 minimum). Funny thing was when I started off as gold nova 3 I assembled a team of randoms. After few weeks of playing only with them I got MGE. That time I met my first LEM in enemy team smurfing. He was really good. When I got to DMG I lost it quite fast and thought that staying there is harder cause players use different tricks and tactics and OBVIOUSLY you begin to have complete noobs unbefitting their ranks as your teammates. After 2 weeks of playing (not everyday) I got to a point where DMG was quite easy.
 If you want to invest in ranking up and being better than maybe buy good set of headphones, mouse, keyboard. Good equipment gives you a very big advantage. Next, adjust configurations, i.e. turn off useless music, sound, reduce voice chat to 10-11, use 10 second alarm music. Bind hotkeys, set your own comfortable sensitivity, etc. For example, I use 4:3 screen ratio with low graphs. As soon as I started using good computer I became LEM in a week. 
Now before you start playing MM make sure to warm up about 15 minutes. Play custom game (aimbotz is good map where you can shoot running bots from every weapon). Play some ffa servers or deathmatch. Let your muscle memory flex. When you are playing a hopeless case don't invest too many emotions and efforts. Just play for fun and try doing some crazy stuff you don't usually do, train your aim. 
So in conclusion
TL;DR buy better equipment, set your own comofrtable settings excluding useless custom ones, warm up before game, find a good team of same level and non toxic relationships, don't get too upset and try new stuff."

1. Crosshair placement!
Many players often dont realise that they are aiming at the ground because they are too focused. But thats the key problem. If you hold up your crosshair then you A: Do more damage cause of bodyshots/headshots
B: You dont have such a long way to be on the head!

2. Movement:
Csgo is nothing like all the other FPS Games out there.
You cant run and shoot at the same time. Its called „Walking Penalty“. If you run you will have a very low chance if hitting your enemy. Stay still and also maybe crouch to get the highest precision.
Another thing i am going to include is peaking. If your mate dies to an Awp on long range, dont try to peak him too. Try to use other possibilities and ways. 

3. Communication
You need to talk to your teammates and tell them what is going on at your position. And also be precise. When you see 3 people rushing you, dont say “ALL B”
Be precise.
If your teammates dont give any calls or information, encourage them to do so. Without information you wont be able to retake a site as a CT or rotate to a site as a T for example.

I‘ll also include Map knowledge as the (4):
Knowing where to go and where the best spots are to defend a site is also important because if you stand in the open you could be killed by 1000 different angles. 
Learning the angles for smokes, nades, flashbangs and mollys is also very useful to keep the enemy of defending their position successfully.

And the last tiny advise i‘ll give you from now on is:
Practice! Noone is the best from the first minutes of playing a new game! You need time to find your style of playing and having fun with this unique game called 
COUNTERSTRIKE GLOBAL OFFENSIVE (CSGO)"

If coming from another FPS (especially arena shooters) you need to relearn cross hair placement. Another important factor to note is ""camping"". In most FPS this is frowned upon, but when holding a site, being able to hold an angle and only moving around in a very small area is key to protecting a site on the CT side and T side after plant. Get to know the maps, try and figure out timings so you can hold the correct angles to entry points. 

Utility is also massively import, know where to smoke, where to molly and use he grenades to soften up opponents that are pushing or holding a site. Timing is everything, a well placed molly can hold back enemies just long enough to reposition or for help to rotate."

First of all, /u/lowerachiever, i'll let you know that you could have added some keywords to what i said, like ""CSGO"" or csgo for example ""CSGO VAC AF 2.0"" and if you scroll waaaaaaay down on the first page you can see a very relevant topic for you, although it is on unknowncheats forum it is not a cheat and a simple tool to solve your vac auth errors (Requires reboot for 100% effectiveness, although it will solve in most cases the temporary issue and will allow you to reconnect on your pending match)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, if you add 2 and 2 you can see that the topic is leading to ""VAC AUTHENTICATION FIXER 2.0"" TOOL, in short VAC AF 2.0, now you have all you need, just google ""CSGO VAC AUTHENTICATION FIXER 2.0 DOWNLOAD"" and here you go, another relevant link literally in front of your screen(again on unknowncheats but if you dig enough on youtube I think you can find a non-expired working link to it, if you don't trust unknowncheats which generally is very very cautious with uploades and are verified manually in a VM before letting users download it). But whatever, you REALLY couldn't find anything, I'll just spoonfeed you, no problem, you're just living up to your username anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

You can also try and fix it without that tool(it was originally posted on reddit, not on unknowncheats and whatevernot, it's been a year or two since the tool dissapeared from reddit and everywhere really), here's the batch script ([https://pastebin.com/MjKQXnp7](https://pastebin.com/MjKQXnp7)) you can run that does what VAC AF2.0 does (FYI a batch script is a .bat file which u can create with a text file (Save as, name.bat (all files) click ok), run and wait until it finishes, it will also restart your pc on it's own when it's done.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope you have a good day.

I personaly buy my skins I dont much momey into it. There are other things out there that are much better than buying ""pixels"". It is pretty dumb to put lots of money into it, But its their money and it makes them happy. Opening cases is pretty dumb as well. It is really rare to get a knife by unboxing one. You see youtubers and streamers unboxing rare dopplers and shit. Realistically most of them blow INSANE amounts of money on cases and they dont make any profit but most of them just want a knife and dont care about profit. But blowing all that money is really a investment too, Most unboxing videos make lots of views and they easily earn the money back and might make profit depending on how much money they dropped. But if your just a average player, Theres a really high chance that by the time you actually get a knife, All the money you spent on cases will be much more than the knife is worth. You could unbox a rare knife and make profit that is if you didn't blow $1,000 on cases and keys like lots of players i've met have done. I really dont get how some skins are so fucking expensive. Like the souvenir awp dragon lore is $20,000 like who the fuck will pay for a sniper with golden stickers on it? With that much money, I can build a duel gaming setup with 3 240hz moniters or maybe triple. I'm not getting in details with the specs because you get my point. Its really not all ridiculous though. Gaming is consideres a sport now. Like having a signed football is like having kennyS signature sticker in a sense. Like having a baseball signed by babe ruth is worth absolutely way more than the all the rarest skins combined. So there kind of the same except the sport itself. They have there perks though. If you have a rare baseball, pokemon card, football, And etc. You have to keep it in mint condition or else its not worth much. If you have a rare skin, You don't have to worry about preserving it. You got to worry about the economy not going to shit or people duplicating the skin, Getting scammed, getting vac or trade banned (if you cheat/scam), Or more people unbox the skin making it less valuable. So that is my opinion on that matter. Dont cheat or scam because thats a shit thing to do."

COUNTER STRIKE on the other hand is a well rounded game that has constant updates and lots of attention from people who want to support the cause (ie, game map developers and the mod community). Not to mention that counter strike involves SO MUCH more strategy and timing that becoming good at the game is a challenge. That coupled with a rank system makes counter strike a WAY better game, it's like the other commenter said: ""don't fix what ain't broken""."

3,2019-08-02,u/bluedream4766,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/ckyyf6/best_case_for_starting_out/evrwjt0/,"The odds are absolutely horrible no matter what case you get in all honesty. You're almost always better off just making a realistic budget and buying the skins you want individually. If you're opening cases to get knives prepare to sink hundreds of dollars into case keys, and on the other end, it makes no sense to spend 20 bucks on keys if you're looking to get a 20-50 dollar skin. 99.9% of people you see in games will have this grandious story about trading or hitting it big and trading up, when most of them are just embarrassed to admit they spent their parents money or are an adult that spent 300 dollars on a video game knife. It is very possible to trade up and hit it big with cases but the odds are just insanely against you. My advice would be go on csgo stash, browse by case, get familiar with what cases have the items youd like and take it from there.

 Bitskins will generally be a cheaper place to buy skins in comparison to the steam market. Go on steam app and set up 2 step verification if you havent (trades will take 2 weeks to process without VS instantly with it), this process takes 7 days to complete so do it asap.

Also, a site like lootbear will allow you to rent things like knives for a ""reasonable price"". Since items have a 1 week trade cooldown every time they are traded, you essentially add 7 days worth of credit to your acct (1-5 dollars per day on avg depending on knife) and get to use a knife for a week. I reccomend this because personally I would never advise anyone making less than 6 figures a year to consider buying a csgo knife (just my personal opinion) without an extensive knowledge of what is going to rise/drop in price and the potential to profit from your buy.


Last thing I want to add is that every ""case site"" is bullshit. The fact that most of them advertise as ""easy profit"" just shows they're looking to rope in diluted kids. What type of business would they be if the odds were in your favor lol? Ignore those sites like the cancer they are. Good luck brother"

3,2019-08-02,u/mz68,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/ckyyf6/best_case_for_starting_out/evstgdz/,"The odds are pretty bad. You've got an 80% chance or so to get a blue which usually means you lose most of your money. Even if you get a pink, which is already rare enough, chances are it's barely worth the price of the key. Let's not even talk about reds, knives or gloves.  


But anyway, google ""Convars CS:GO Case Simulator"" and try your luck. You're not going to lose anything when you open cases there (since it's just a simulator), and you'll get a good idea of what'll happen with your money if you do it on Steam :D

If you want an item, find it on market, and buy it outright. Cases are a fast way to lose all your $$$ and get nothing in return.

I would start with a glock skin, a USP-s skin, a M4A1-S skin, and an AK skin, then an AWP skin; to hit all your bases.

Sure you CAN hit a knife or nice item, but more likely than not, you spend 2.50 on a key, .03 on a case, and get a 14 cent item. Lol..  


Notice the recurring theme of all the comments: Dont open cases. Its not smart at all. Just buy what item you want, in the quality you want.  


If you look, you could prob find a Elite Build AK47 for about 8-9$ that is .00XX quality, AKA almost perfect quality. I got mine for 8.34ish and there was another one I saw that was .00XX quality for a tiny bit more IIRC. Maybe its gone now but.. nice looking AK skin (one of the main weps you should be using and mastering) and very very inexpensive."

Learn individual maps, dont queue for ranked for all maps (I suggest playing scrimmage mode to get a feel for ranked with no punishment as well and I also reccomend dust2 as your first map to master as newer maps have a lot more going on in terms of wonky/multiple angles to watch) .

Csgo seems this ""worth it"" now because you cant play it, once you can and the feeling of it being new wears off, you're gonna look at steam everytime you open csgo, see the endless selection of awesome games you couldn't play on ps4 and feel bummed you were too anxious to wait and blew your money. Is csgo great? Yes, it it worth paying essentially the price of another ps4 to play (Crap laptop + game + mouse/keyboard)? No its not

Edit: also brother if you're 17 get a part time job, sell some weed, cut neighbors grass, go on craigslist and look for part time gigs passing out flyers. $10 hour 20 hours a week will give you about $300 more in 2 weeks. Work hard and itll pay off."

I remembered back in the day where I was hardstuck gn3 and then after a lot of coaching from my higher rank friends and tons of practicing, I finally ranked up to mg1. The key here is tons of practice, play wif higher ranked friends and tell them to teach you tips and tricks on anything, watch pro players play and learn from them, (also be aware of their mistakes and take note), csgo youtubers also help sometimes 'cos they tell you infos that some pro players don't know. Other than that is just spending a lot of time into the game. Play at least 6 hours or more (depends on you, this is my opinion, really) and if you're not feelin' it, just take a short break and jump back into the game. If you're tired, don't push yourself too much and get some sleep, then hop into some games, or maybe come back for it tomorrow. Warmup games also important, and I recommend playing retakes and 128 tick ffa dm. Retake servers really helps you with how you retake bomb sites, smokes and flashes that'll help you etc. Ffa dm servers can improve your reaction time, flicking skills and such.

For that, your aim should be always on head level. Do not go around the map looking at the ground and then flick to the player. That's a common mistake of begginers.   
You should know that with pistols (not deagle) and smgs you can walk while shooting. Deagle, rifles and snipers you have to be still for max accuracy when shooting. There's also the recoil on weapons, (tip: on the ak-47, just get ur aim on the body of the enemy and shoot, pulling your crossair downwards. The first 4/5 bullets will kill him. You don't need more. Iz tutorial of how to frag :D) but you have to research that out on your own.  
You need to learn how to strafe. Ex. while moving to right, using d, the fastest way to get your speed reduce to 0, is by pressing a, while letting go of d. That will make you stop so that you can shoot where you are aiming at, at that moment. (When you see someone that killed you while walking and then stopped, that's a strafe. On lower levels you will see people saying ""RUNNING HS AHAHAH VAC"". Just a little reminder so you don't make a fool out of yourself like those people) You can also do the same thing by using the Ctrl button to croutch. The effects are the same. By keep walking you will do a ""crab walk"" which is a nice mechanic on Csgo.  
By aware of the minimap and sound (and chat if you wanna know if your team sent any smokes flahes etc). Very important tool that people don't use until they get to mg or smth xd  
Spam is important (Smokes, he nades, flashes and molotovs). Try to use it wisely. When you get to better ranks, people will ask you flashes and that's when you know that your playing a more serious cs.  
You can get your own binds. You will need a jumpthrow bind later on. You can instabuy equipment by pressing numbers, say sentences and other things.  
You will need an autoexec with binds and other codes (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\userdata\\999999\\730\\local\\cfg) destination folder.  
When running csgo on steam, useful launch options ""-high -refresh 144 -tickrate 128 -novid -nod3d9ex1 +exec autoexec"" If you have a 60Hz monitor change to ""-refresh 60""  
Get a nice crosshair or make one on your own. There are maps on workshop that can do that.   
[https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=730&amp;actualsort=trend&amp;browsesort=trend&amp;p=1&amp;days=-1](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=730&amp;actualsort=trend&amp;browsesort=trend&amp;p=1&amp;days=-1)  
Map 1, 2, 4, 6 you should give them a look.  
Having a good monitor, pc, mouse, keyboard ofc it helps a lot. Having 300fps and a 24'',144hz monitor will give you a huge advantage against people with laptops and not so good pcs.   
When you win most of your duels, know the maps, use spam, (a skill level like lem) if you wanna get to the next level, your should play faceit and get a team. Btw, the higher ranks on matchmaking have too many cheaters so you're just wasting your time. Climb on faceit and after lv7, you will start playing some real cs.  
These are long run tips. Start S1mple, get CoMpLex. If you wanna play the game for fun with no general goal just take a look at the basic mechanics like strafe and good crosshair placement. If you wanna get a little spicier, you have the starting tips here. Watch streams, get more knowledge, get better. 

Csgo is a nice game but the community isn't that nice cuz of retards with cheats. Cheats don't give skill and is a waste of time for everyone playing in the server. I hope I didn't scared you with all this text eheh. Gl hf."

3. Communicate! Dont‘t be afraid to talk and try to be nice. Most people will help you, if you tell them you‘re new to the game.
4. Learn when to eco (Don‘t buy under 2.000$).

This shoud get you to mid gold nova, after some time. After this you can learn nades, full spraypatterns, exequtions, etc. But this will take time.
Don‘t buy expensive stuff like a gaming mouse, keyboard or those stupidly expensive 144hz monitors. This won‘t help you a lot, if you‘re a newbee."

The game is completely economically based, sometimes it's better not to buy one round so that you can get  gun and armour the next

Each gun rewards different amounts of cash per kill

Rifles reward $300 each except the AWP which is $100
SMGS reward $600 each except the P90 which is $300
Pistols reward reward $300 except the CZ75 which is $100
Shotguns reward $900 each
Grenade kills reward $300
Knife kills reward $1500

First round of each half is the pistol round, most people buy armour some will buy a pistol and a couple of grenades.

Depending on whether or not you win the pistol round will decide on what you buy the following round.  Genuinely if you lose you don't buy anything for one round so that you can full buy the next (M4/AK, Full armour, grenades, defuse kit) if you win the pistol the standard buy is SMGs and armour and a few grenades (called an anti eco as they reward a decent amount of money per kill and the other team will rush a site if they are on eco)

Each gun has a different spray pattern, mastering how you use each weapon is a key factor as only a few weapons allow you to aim down sights (4 snipers and 2 assault rifles).  

Running and shooting isn't advised unless you're using a SMG and it affects how accurate you are."

That being said the second half of this video told me without doubt you dont fully understand csgo. Heres why I think that;

1. Spray, is an integral part of the skill curve if the game. Getting better at csgo is synonymous with getting better at controlling the different recoil patterns.

2. There is no negev or auto sniper meta. Look at the guns purchased so far in the ongoing major. The gun meta has been ak/ m4 and awp. The new meta is this plus kreigs and augs plus more low cost smgs been used.

3. No mention of the pro scene. Its like reveiwing football without mentioning any famous players, teams or tournaments!

4. Whilst its subjective I respectfully disagree with your sentiments about dz being just another tacky battle royale. Dev support for it has been really good, including implementing new, creative and inovative mechanics that add depth and make it suprisingly fun
 
That being said,

I agree war games is fun, most importantly though I cant praise you enough for the production value of the video. Editing is on point and and your voice/ manner suits this style of review, reminded me a bit of dunkey.  regardless, ive subscribed!

Maybe u should thank russia for single handedly beating the germans and finishing ww2.

Maybe u should thank greeks philosophers for defining the democratic values and political system and for a huge amount of philosophy,
Geometry, architecture, awesome mythology that inspired different works of art oh and for building the basis of modern WESTERN CULTURE. 
Thank greeks for kick starting the liberation of the Balkans . 

Ooh if greece was so bad, then why do people risk their lives to immigrate here?

Turkish culture , idfk anything about it but their religion is anti-freedom and sexist but then again idk much about turkey.

Poland hasn't done much tbh but i reckon it's not a toxic culture because it's a ripoff of russian culture. 

Russian culture isn't toxic, like why would people continue marrying russian women if russian culture was toxic?

All cultures have their pros and cons but the cultures with the least cons are the best and they are pretty much all of western cultures.
The worst cultures are those of indigenous african nation and asian nations .

For example chinese people have a bullshit belief that eating a tiger penis is therapeutic and tigers who are already endangered continue dying for that. This is part of their culture .

Indian culture has *shitting, cleaning dishes , drinking and washing themselves * as part of their culture and this obviously is a bad culture as this damages the ecosystem and nature in general (their culture belief is that nobody should clean their river it is ""sacred"")

Africans continue to kill some women and albinos becuz their bad culture believes they are witches and cursed.

Just know that western cultures are the best.
I'm saying that all cultures are not equal and that my country's culture and generally western cultures are the best .
But western cultures are not perfect and there are still lots of stuff that we can get from other cultures too."

One of my friends - Space Toaster, wanted to play a game of CSGO, I said sure and jumped on with him - from round 1 we were bombarded by these three Spanish guys who were aggressive, racist and just down right toxic towards both myself and my friend. Repeatedly dropping the N word in chat and making monkey noises whenever possible - all three were swiftly muted but then proceeded to team flash - block team mates into corners - team damage and call out positions to the enemies.  

Nobody wants team mates like these surely, if anyone has any knowledge of how to report them with a more serious manner than the ingame report then that'd be great.

You can focus on kills or you can just be a good player. I usually do the second. I make sure I enter first, land my smokes, cover my teammates, and plant/defuse the bomb. This gets me MVP points and I rank up fast. More kills is nice, but it isn't about all that every time. 

Just get yourself some poaitive skill difference between you and the other 9 players so the game knows you don't belong with those ranks. Do it consistently, even if you lose and bottom frag.... like I did recently, and you could rank up accidentally."

Steam expects to be installed on the C: drive. It sets up the Steam Client Service to point to C:\Program Files (x86)\...

If it's not on the C drive Windows won't be able to run the service

To check if this is your problem:

* Run (Win + R) services.msc
* Right click on Steam Client Service and go to Properties
* Check the path - make sure this points to your steam directory

If the path doesn't match:

* Run regedit
* Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Steam Client Service
* Double click on ImagePath and change the value to match your steam install (e.g. ""D:\Steam\bin\SteamService.exe""  /RunAsService) *dont forget the last bit*

Go back to services.msc and start the Steam Client Service"

4. CYAN

For custom crosshair color:
• set cl_crosshaircolor to 5
• make a cfg file with the following commands:
cl_crosahaircolor_r (0-255)
cl_crosshaircolor_g (0-255)
cl_crosshaircolor_b (0-255)
• the values 0-255 will vary the intensity of red,green, and blue
• name the cfg file something like crosshair.cfg
Finally:
bind &lt;key&gt; ""exec crosshair.cfg""

*Sidenote* this method requires more keybinds for more crosshairs.

3,2019-10-01,u/dumbthrrowaway2000,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/d9birj/new_cheat_being_used_to_get_players_overwatched/f23gs09/,"this feature only appeared in December when they released the Danger Zone update, when Valve changed the animation code. Previously, there was something similar called fake angles, when the server animated only the first movement command in a batch (choked packets and then sent packet) which means the server would use the angle from the first packet to animate the hitboxes and then send the last packet to the clients for them to animate it. They changed it so the server animated all the commands in a batch and sent the last command to the client. Good, right? Nope, this made the problem better but still exploitable.  
  
 Using the same methods cheaters can desync their abs angles (goal feet angles) up to 58 degrees away from their hitboxes (amount is based on velocity, moving is about 25 degrees, that's one of the main reasons cheaters use a feature to walk slower than normal), and the reason the legs are twisted is because there's an angle named LBY (or Lower Body Yaw) which is self explanatory, and when standing still it only updates if it's more than 110 degrees away from your viewangles or every 1.1 seconds, which means cheaters can predict when it will update and tell the server ""I'm looking in this direction"" and choke the packet (so it's silent) which makes the pose desync range larger.  
  
   Valve could fix this easily by only animating the last packet in a batch on the server, instead of all of them. There's an addon for community servers that fixes the issue. The cheat provider the guy in the video is using recently added this feature as a legit feature (instead of a rage feature) but completely messed it up on release, making it so you couldn't climb ladders and your legs kept sliding (since they weren't fixing IN_ keys, which are used for the sliding animation when counter-strafing away from your velocity direction)
  
  
EDIT: Overwatchers won't be able to see if The Suspect is desyncing, but they can see if allies or enemies are desyncing. This is not Overwatch bait, people just think it's just funny to do versus legit players, but the main usage is so closet cheaters miss head since the aimbot aims perfectly at the head hitbox. Legit players won't have much of an issue unless the enemy is desyncing at an edge like in the video"

Introducing the X-ray Scanner for users in France:

— The X-ray Scanner allows users to reveal the item inside any container.


— Each user’s x-ray scanner comes preloaded with a one-time exclusive non-tradable item—the P250 | X-Ray.

— Users in France must first claim this item to use the x-ray scanner again.

In France, every container must first be placed into the X-ray Scanner to reveal the item inside before purchasing a key. The X-ray Scanner will consume the container and reveal the item inside. To use the X-ray Scanner again, the revealed item must be claimed; it is not possible to scan another Container without claiming the revealed item.

In France containers can no longer be purchased from Steam Community Market, but can still be sold."

&amp;#x200B;

The used razer mouse is (in my opinion) not worth keeping depending on how used it is, razer mice are prone to double clicking after use and it'd happen soon to you if the mouse has age. Price of it regardless is about $20 used. Keyboard isn't worth anything really, $10 max, and the wifi adapter could be a cheap $5 from ebay for all we know.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall that's a cost of $254 of parts he's listed. Of course it comes with a case, a motherboard (for a very dated cpu), power supply, and those sorts of things. Is an unspecified case, outdated motherboard, and power supply worth $146? Your call."

Death match and bot maps will help as aforementioned. Basically everything EnvylesS said is vital. Though i do recommend finding a good viewmodel and finding the right sensitivity over time.  Also learning grenades will also help in the long run.[https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=365126929](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=365126929) (Crashz viewmodel gen) 

Good movement and strafing will help, it'll make it harder for the enemy to shoot you(there are tutorials out there and itll take time to develop)  
Learn where to prefire and also recognising whether you should aim for the head or not. If the enemy is far away it'd be better not to engage or aim for the body.(The only exempts are certain pistols which do low damage and armour penetration). There isn't much to say other than playing the game, a lot of what youll learn develops over playing the game. CSGO has a large learning curve and there'll be some points like any other game where one day youll be doing horrible but the day before you were playing at an excellent standard. Play with friends and it's completely fine if you do not enjoy the game. During your first 3 or so months youll definitely recognise the improvements in your performance. (Btw dont get toxic over it, itll harm your performance and your teammates as well)  
Main Points:  
\- Enjoy the Game(Whether it's in the wall of text or not)  
\- Learn spray  
\- Understand that some days are just not your day  
\- Recognising when you should engage in a fight and what's the most efficient way if you do.  
\- Practise on bot maps and deathmatch  
\- Keep a level headed manner  
\- Patience is key  
\- Suitable sens and viewmodel  
\- Have FUN! :\]"

So that brings the total to 1968$

It isn't as hard to spend as you might imagine, the first case I unboxed was August 19, 2014 (a ST five Seven Nightshade), which makes the total amount I spent was 393.60$ per year which is 7.57$ every weekend. 

Overall I am definitely in the negative, I acquired enough stuff to trade for a karambit blue steel mw but I later sold that for cash. 

So was it worth it... probably not but I didn't spend that all at once so I didn't really notice and tbh it's interesting looking back at all the different items I used to own. My favorite still being the awp boom as that was one of the fist skins I got from a trade up contract."

Cause I sold the AK and the ugly knife and got a knife I really love instead. 

But in the end, I'm glad that buying cases became impossible where I live. I've spend too much money on keys for dropping almost only ugly skins. Now I won't spend a dime in skins. There is a real problem with skins in CS : we got only the shittiest skins on the market when there are hundreds and hundreds of amazing skins in the workshop.

Hello everybody.

I am making this post to address
the issue of this one notorious hackers, 
'BOT Vladimir'. 

He is normally found in deathmatch sigma
and the flying scoutsman modes. He also has a hacker friend which goes by the name of 'BOT Chet', and the two of them reek havoc on servers.

Whenever you click on them, you can not see their profile and they only talk in russian. This is just one of the key pieces of evidence I have towards their demise. I believe that they use wallhacks and spinbot but I am not sure. I need this community to bond together and take down these hackers.

Everytime I join a game they ruin it and make me lose and most of the time, ragequit the game. They are ruining my change at a professional deathmatch and flying scoutsman career. 

Thank you very much for understanding!"

The purpose of any anti-cheat is to block all cheaters from accessing the game servers or permanently remove them from the game servers.  
That means all. Doesn't matter how little or much he/she is cheating. It's still cheating.

Honestly i have seen a huge increase in the number of cheaters (per number of games) and that happened after Overwatch came out as a ""anti-cheat feature"" and even more as CS:GO went f2p.  


What concerns me is that even though there are ways of dealing with cheaters which haven't been implemented into the game, Valve just chooses to stick to it's methods and launch a gigantic ""middle finger"" to all the honest players by not doing anything about the cheater problem.  


Does anyone remember AMX ModX from CS 1.6? Do you guys remember that there was a very useful (although a bit tedious) feature that allowed a private server admin to trigger a screenshot command onto the client and thus creating an actual image of what the client was seeing on his monitor.  
I remember it clearly since i was an admin and i saw a lot of interesting things from cheaters who were trying to minimize the visual output of the cheat so that they might avoid ""detection"".  


Don't you think such a feature would be better implemented into CSGO as well?  
I am obviously not talking about the ""Screenshot"" feature that Steam has but the ""Print Screen"" button on your keyboard which, when pressed, it capture the actual graphic rendering of the screen at the time of the press."

2,2019-12-16,u/Igrado,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/eb5d9d/how_to_be_average/fb505lz/,"In 2018 I climbed out of Silver and peaked at GN3 I stopped playing because it was a lot of work to keep my GN2 rank and I burned out.

For that climb, I practiced specifically every day. My goal was to practice one round's worth of time every day I played. (This was part of the reason I burned out, so find your personal limit). It was a good plan for getting better, and I enjoyed the success of seeing my game and my rank improve. 

The first commitment I recommend is developing a warmup routine. For me, my warmup routine is aim practice and lasts 10-15 minutes. I do this every time I play. When I skip this, I absolutely play worse. My KD and HS% directly reflect this.

I chose aim practice as my warmup routine for now because I've never been particularly good at aim. Getting out of Silver is going to require smart play, and improved skill. (Side note: TALENT is natural, SKILL is learned.) You're going to end up in a shitty PUG 20%+ if the time, and the more you can minimize that, the faster you will rank up.

Next commitment is skill improvement. Any day you have time for 2+ rounds, take time pre-war up to learn a new skill or practice an old one.

For me, this was learning smokes. It took me only a handful of sessions to learn 8 Mirage smokes. Now I just practice them about once a week. I can repeat this with Molly's or move to Cache, or whatever. Look for YouTube videos or check out practice maps in the Steam Workshop by DOLNMA.

You could choose a different skill though that fits your style more. Such as recoil control, hitting moving targets, peeking corners, retakes, etc. Choose one and work on it until you go from 'noob' to 'great for my skill level'.

The key is to keep improving. On purpose. And to never forget to revisit the basics every day. It's just  like any sport. Even Aaron Rodgers has to practice the handoff. Imagine that."

You don't have to do WASD specifically just don't use arrow keys cuz that is legit going full retard. Why even bother with a keyboard if youre going to use 1/100th the potential of it?

1.) You will rank probably silver-ish.

2.) You will learn slowly because of your opponents and atmosphere.

3.) You will probably lose 50-60 (or more, who knows) of your games.

4.) Matchmaking system will then think it has your accounts rank figured out completely and it will take you **TWENTY FIVE WINS, IN A ROW, OR MORE; TO RANK UP EVEN ONCE.**

========================

Do it my way (learn outside of comp, literally anywhere else):

1.) You'll learn faster.

2.) You will place much much higher in placement matches (starting rank).

3.) Your account can actually rank up when you win. Doesnt require a TWENTY SPREE of ONLY WINS to rank up.

So you tell me, which sounds better? Lol..

And yes you can do scrims!!!! They are NOT ranked, just 'competitive'. AKA you should try your hardest, listen to teamwork, and try to improve. I literally ONLY play scrims, so long that my comp rank expired and I cant see it visually until I win another match. The new 'breach' map is low key prob one of the most well made maps ever made for CS. Its much much better than the active duty maps, IMO. Especially if youre a nerd like me and learn the smokes/flashes/mollys/strats.

Normally 30-50 fps and on particularly lucky days I get 60-70. So the first thing, video settings all on low, no fxaa no graphics. Go as low as you possibly can. 

Personally, when I turn the music off, I can sometimes get away with a trivial but still rewarding 1-2 fps. 

Next have a keybind to clear the commands in the console command history, the animation cache, bombs and debugs with this command: 

bind t ""clear;clear_anim_cache;clear_debug_overlays;clear_bombs""

You can replace the ""t"" with any key you would like. Everytime you press ""t"" or the key you binded it boosts my fps back to 55 or sometimes even 70. Again something personal but one of my biggest ways to boost fps. I literally just spam t when I start lagging and I'm fine. 

Also another big one. Other games with a high storage takeup really hurts the fps. After I deleted some I got a boost of about 5-10 fps. 

My computer specs are:

CPU: I can't find it but it's a 1.6 GHz 

GPU: Intel HD 1200 

Random access memory: 4 GB

Storage: 128 GB

Don't jump all the time unless you need to. Don't move while shooting. Learn the recoil patterns as weapons have specific patterns that you can counter by moving your crosshair a specific way (tutorials everywhere including a workshop map you can use).

Use your ears!!! Sound is key to positioning and learning where your opponents are.

Change that crosshair! You might want to keep the default one for a bit though.

There are plenty of youtube tutorials on how to play, just look up a problem you have and an answer will be there. An important thing to learn is how to ""counter strafe"".

Learn about what workshop maps are, you might know what they are already but getting some recommended ones can help you with playing the game.

Watch that tilt! Wouldn't jump straight into competitive first thing **especially alone**. Play with a friend for some support and pointers while playing. 

The community server browser offers different ways to play csgo (chill playing).

Positioning and nade placement is more important than aim, but aim of course is still a large chunk of the game.

Don't get discouraged from the mistakes, learn from them and don't take the embarrassment like a punch to the face.

Play hard, play competitively, have fun!"

It will work with anything you had equipped last, but I don't see any reason to use it for anything other than quick unscoping.   


Also, the 'alias' command is simply a way for you to write your own commands that aren't a part of the normal cvars. So you could do ""alias  +unscope"" or any word you want that isn't already used by the game. The important parts are making sure the + and - are used with the same word. The + means ""when pressing/holding down"" and - means ""on release"".

1,2020-01-15,u/iTzFuZiioN,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/ep4sz3/need_some_tips/feh2v3d/,"You should probably start playing with premade parties. In CSGO teamwork and communication is key. Being in a discord/teamspeak/etc. together helps a lot. You probably will have to get used to giving infos, but with time you will learn how to do it. Watching Pros or Streamers with high ranks can give you a sense of how to communicate properly, without talking too much. Even when somebody doesnt talk, being in a team which is used to play with each other will take a lot of the random factors out of the game. The lower the rank gets, the higher the randomness of the game rises. 

If you don't have enough friends who play cs for a 5 man party, try finding people on steam discussions or reddit, there are plenty. 

In addition to that try practicing your aim and learn some grenades, it will make upranking way easier. And very important: Buy grenades and use them. From my own experience I know, at lower ranks people like to not buy grenades and if they do, they won't use them. Rather use a grenade when it's unnecessary, instead of not using it at all. 

Maybe try switching up your crosshair, viewmodel, sensitivity, etc. settings and find the ones that suit you the best. 

Last: Try to rationalize as much as you can and reflect on your own mistakes, blaming others is easy, but admitting your mistakes and thinking about them will make you better. This will get less if you have some friends who you play with on a regular basis, since you will get used to each others play style and will know how to adapt to it."

In fact it's simple, you just need to do what I said but also let each command not only change the bind but also call the other command. Like that each setup will activate and change your bind to call the other setup.

To make it simple i rename each setup ""bhop"" and  ""normal"" to do it type this :

Alias normal ""bind MWHEELUP invnext ; bind MWHEELDOWN inprev ; bind z bhop""

Alias bhop ""bind MWHEELUP +jump ; bind MWHEELDOWN +jump ; bind z normal""

Now when you type normal in the console it will set your mouse wheel to scroll weapons, and when you type bhop it will set your mouse wheel to jump. But there is also the [bind z normal/bhop] in each command so when you press z it not only change the setup but also switch your z to call the other setup next time. Now you can bind z to bhop to start the cycle (you can put any key at the place of z but remember to change it in the 3 commands lines).

In short, type this :

Alias normal ""bind MWHEELUP invnext ; bind MWHEELDOWN inprev ; bind z bhop""

Alias bhop ""bind MWHEELUP +jump ; bind MWHEELDOWN +jump ; bind z normal""

Bind z bhop"

But, there is a purpose. *Speed* is key to playing csgo effectively, because it gives less time to react, and having a knife out means you're running as fast as possible, which also translates into effective bunnyhopping (faster still). On top of that, you can switch between a knife and a weapon fast enough to keep the speed you gain with your knife out, and have a weapon ready at the same time. 

But those are multiple actions within a matter of milliseconds. And it takes time to learn them. Until one gets used to b-hopping, forget quick switch. In fact, rebind the keystroke from q to, say, the minus on the numpad until ready."

Licking is key if you really wanna make your team mad just lurk in the opposite direction of your team every round no matter what strat they call and just practice shooting the enemy team in the back every round as this is probably the only way you can get kills also it’s a good idea to probably just mute your entire team they only serve the Purpose of getting on your nerves as I always say quite team is the best team i mean who do they think they are speaking to an absolute god I mean I’m so insanely above them and they try to speak to me like wtf just sit shut up and take my carry like the little boy they are but people continue to amaze me they always find some stupid remark to make about you that makes no sense cuz I’m the one with 30+ kills every game I’m the one who such a beast that I can take on the entire other team and my own team at the same time and sometimes I do just that I love reminding them of how small they are how weak they are in my wake sometimes I wish people would just step aside witness my awesomeness.

We have the game sensitivity, and the mouse sensitivity. And cartain mouse configs also affects the sensitivity in other ways. 

To simplify what i mean as low sensitivity follow this simple rule:

Your mice must have a 360 degrees turn ingame going to the left side of your mousepad until the right side. Bigger pads, lower sensitivity.

Go to a offline server. Point to a place and then make your character make a complete turn and look at the same place. This complete turn must be your entire mousepad.

If you have a gigantic mousepad, pick the sensitivity aspects of a pro player you like and copy. 

If you have a small mousepad, think about investing in a big one. Mousepads will protect your mouse, witch is the most important tool of a CSGO player. People usually bother too much about mechanic keyboards and stuff, 144hz screens or high end pcs when a simple mouse with a very good sensor will make you play a lot better. Usually Zowie mices are the best and what most pro players use. But you can search what sensor the zowies use and follow other low cost products with the same sensor. The rest like ""dpi stuff, Collors, etc"" are just propaganda and Will not affect your game at all.

People sell you things like speed mousepads or control mousepads, but this is acctually about confort. Pick one who have a good aderence to your desk and stay in position while you play. The rest is just the skin and the material you like.

Do not change the sensitivity too fast. You most adapt a few points at a time. You will realise each time you lower your sense it will become easier to kill your enemys."

If you read the estudo de demo archive, you Will figure it all several bind keys to slow motion or acelerate, pause or moving beyond rounds. The screen will be much cleaner as well so it will help you to pay atenction in the game you are watching.

Hit the dropdown for Disk Drives, and take that long string of characters (minus ""ATA Device"") and do a quick Google search, it should come back either Hard Drive or Solid State.  In your case though, my guess is you will find it to be a HDD given your symptoms and I'm also guessing this is a pre-built?

Step two change your password from your web browser on your phone (NOT YOUR COMPUTER) you will need steam guard to get the confirmation code to change it

Step three change your email password from your phone as well do not try to log in on your computer to your email or web browser after this you might have a key logger 

Step four scan your computer for any viruses or malware 

Note: this happened because you probably did something stupid like signing to a 3rd party site with your steam account (DONT DO THIS) 

If they have yet to take your accounts inventory changing your password will trade lock your account for 5 days they try to send you messages to distract you and give themselves time to do that they need to in order to get your items
 
The reason for changing your password on your email is because they can use your email in order to fully take your steam account and disable your authentication app

I solo queued and muted my team. Just played normal game and tried to get atleast 1 kill per round, maybe 2 if possible. But they should not be exit kills. If you give your team an advantage in the beginning it sometimes turns out to be game changing point.

Total no of kills are always more than number of rounds, defuse and bomb plants whenever you get chance. Gradually you will rank up.

Teamwork will definetly help you win more games but you get that rarely. I made friends but instead of giving info they start telling their story of how they died instead of giving any useful info.

There is no point in talking or giving any info. Also silver and gn ranks have bad aim and are scared to do anything, don't keep track of time, bad settings like auto pickup on, keep complaining about bad mouse, keyboard, internet and when they finally get a clear shot.. They fuck up spray. You can clearly see they don't know it at all.

It is fucking disgusting to play MM. I prefer faceit more, which only improved my game.

Also the reason all those streamers talk about it is just bc its hyped up and marketed really good, not bc its some godlike game. For example on the 3rd everyone was streaming about it because they knew everyone was gonna be on twitch trying to get a key for the beta, and they had like 3x the viewers they notmally have because everyone was on twitch trying to get a key.

Idk how the gunplay will be and it might be allright, but the look of a game is important too, for a lot of people.

CS:GO uses a modified GLICKO-2 ranking system. Many factors contribute to your rank including k/d, k/a/d, utility damage, enemies flashed, “round influence”, perceived teamwork by the algorithm, and w/l ratio, amongst others.

In a GLICKO-2 system the expected outcome of the match also weights the gains/losses to your rank. Based on your teammates and opponents skill level the expected outcome is determined and if the actual outcome lines up with that prediction the bumps/hits to everyone’s respective rank are less than if the opposite outcome is achieved.

If you are in a match that the system expects you to lose and your team ends up winning, then you and everyone on your team gets a higher bump to your stats than if it was a match that your team was expected to win. Likewise for the opposition.

Many components are kept as a “black box” that the public is not informed of to keep people from abusing the system entirely.

Movement is a big problem for many players, now heres my catch,
I love csgo.
If I had the time (which is limited by either my mom or my team not wanting to play and solo q being shit) I would have more than 800hrs rn.
I know many things were'nt intended but didn't got bugfixed because those are cool features; bhopping, surfing, not getting falldamage if you land on weird angles.
Which is all movement based, since I aint got the best reaction time (I think never tested it) and don't have the best aim, I heavily focused on movement in cs when I started.
Reading that the movement doesn't feel good makes me sad since I think csgo has the best movement I've ever seen/felt.
I like the abilities tho and since its gonna be developed by Riot games, we will probably have many updates, I play league of legends aswell and the amount of times you needing to wait for a teammate that didn't notice a update is stupidly high XD.
I love the idea with the abilities.
But here's the thing...
Its Riot games.
We will find way to many OP stuff.
everytime Riot games released a new champion in league, he was meta.
There was a ""toplane"" meta consisting of Mordekaiser, Garen and Darius. We had Sett for a while and the amount of rage quites and broken desks he caused is huge. He just broke through the scores and is now the #1 toplaner.
Also a big problem is point and click.
There are champions like garen who'm I mentioned earlier that don't require any skill and will win way to many fights just because of their abilities. Garen is good, not the player playing him. Which is gonna be a huge problem in an tactical shooter aswell. If there is some ability that is low risk high reward (which exists way to often fuck you Riot who the fuck invented fiddlesticks or master yi?) then he will easily the topfragger in everygame, getting into an rank he never should've been. (Which can't happen in league that much since not many characters can 1v5 because 1v5ing in league is different than 1v5ing in csgo)"

Firstly, i toyally recommend you not to play awp too much until you are a consistent player with a rifle. You will play with a rifle mostly, so you need to be a good rifler before taking the awp in your hands. 
Watch movement videos on youtube (made by warowl for example) and other players and also practice what you see there. Movemement and crosshair placement is key in winning duels, so you might as well want to improve that. 
Do play respawn, but from the community server browser. This combined with workshop maps for your aim/reactions/flicks. I have a very good one, will post it here after i find it on youtube. You need to develop muscle memory and also trust your muscle memory. The best way is that aim map and playing a lot of respawn. You ll see that after some training and when you ll see the improvement, you ll be able to flick much quicker and much more effectively.
Watch pro games so you develop your gamesense. That will win you many clutch rounds that would look lost, or will help you spot when you should rotate, when you should call for help etc. Gamesense and they way you judge a situation may be just as important as your aim.
Last but not least, when i play soloqueue i never trust my teammates. Always play like you are 1v5 because that s what will keep you alive. Of course you ll have to take risks now and then but usually never blindly truat that your teammate will hold your flank, flash for you, help you in any situation. In matchmaking that usually doesn t happen.
If you have any questions i am more than happy to answer them."

It's likely because you're not performing up to the other players' expectations, which is pretty shitty, if you ask me. Unfortunately, matchmaking can be quite toxic at times.

In my experience (about 3 years of playing Global Offensive), very little factors *can* contribute to getting kicked out of a match: Missing a kill, getting killed constantly, not following meta rules (when to eco when to go full buy, how many players go where), not planting the bomb on time, not saving a highly valuable weapon (the AWP, for example), not following dead teammates' instructions in 1vX scenarios (this one is silly though).

If you want to play matchmaking, then I suggest studying the game mechanics a bit, not just by playing casually. Watch tutorials on YouTube, and perhaps some tournament matches on Twitch. It's going to assist you to be better at matchmaking when it comes to tactics and decision making.

I also highly recommend queuing with friends who are familiar with your skill level. Or finding friends in casual game mode who are performing around your level and then invite them to matchmaking. It's also key that you don't get tilted when some harasses you. The best way to go about it is to mute any players who show any sign of agression or intent to harass. You can also report them.

So in short, study the game a bit more, get into MM with people you know, keep cool and be friendly, mute and report anybody who verbally abuses or tries to harass you."

MGE-LEM is the true ELO hell. You can win like 18 games in a row at LE and you'll still be the same rank as you started. (Source, went on an 18 win streak with my friend at LE and he didnt rankup, we lost 2 games and he went to DMG). The average games ranks were LE too for those curious. 

The thing you gotta realise, is pretty much what the other guy said, consistency is key. But also enjoy being at a lower rank. The game is easier. Try to spot the smurfs in your games and take those guys on. Theres nothing worse than going higher than your skill level and getting rekt every round. 

As for improving your individual gameplay. Just spend more time watching whats happening around you. Counter strike is an FPS game. But gamesense and strategy can be your best tools. If you know where the enemy are going and what theyre thinking, your odds of beating them increase exponentially.

Finally, theres no such thing as a shit team, if you learn how to work around all different kinds of players then you will win more games than those that cant. Learn what your teams strengths are. What site is being lost every round. How you can support them to play better. My little brother started playing the game at christmas. He has 500 hours now and hes chilling around MG2, hes absolutely trash, but we can play around him, and in turn, despite his lack of solo ability, as a team hes still holding his own at his rank."

1. Navigate to your `config.cfg` file. It should be under *..Steam\\userdata\\&lt;user-ID&gt;\\730\\local\\cfg* (I'm not exactly sure where it is exactly located on macOS, if it's following Linux' file hierarchy standard it could be in the *.steam* folder in your home directory).
2. Make a back up of `config.cfg`. Simply do a copy-paste inside the folder and gave the copy a name without any spaces (e.g., `settings.cfg` or `autoexec.cfg`).
3. Modify your game's launch options to load your configuration file upon game launch: Open **Steam** \-&gt; Go to your **Library** \-&gt; Find **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive** \-&gt; Right click on the game, then select **Properties...** \-&gt; On the *General* tab, select **Set launch options...** \-&gt; Add this line: `+exec your-config.cfg` (yes, the plus \[+\] is necessary before *exec*; e.g., `+exec autoexec.cfg`) -&gt; Click **OK** and close the *Properties* window.
4. Launch the game and verify that the game loaded your configuration file. If it didn't, then bring up the console (`\\`\`/`\~`key) and type in`exec your-config.cfg\` (without the plus \[+\] this time).

Did the game load your settings now or are they again overwritten? If it didn't load your settings, then verify that the newly created `.cfg` is still in its location.

**To fix** `video.txt`:

1. Navigate to the location of `video.txt`. It's supposed to be in the same location as the `config.cfg` from the previous instructions.
2. Right click on file and select **Get Info** \-&gt; Select **Sharing &amp; Permissions** \-&gt; Click on the **Read only** option.
3. If the steps above didn't work, follow these instructions carefully [https://chriswrites.com/how-to-change-file-permissions-using-the-terminal/](https://chriswrites.com/how-to-change-file-permissions-using-the-terminal/) to change the file permission to read only using the terminal.

Also you get matched in games based on your trust level. So if you have cheaters as often as you describe then your trust level must be on the same shitty level as theirs.

Also Easy Anti-Cheat is running on kernel level like vanguard. Anti cheats have no business running on ring-0 ever. Period. You administrator account doesn't even run on ring 0. The only acceptable way an anti cheat would run on kernel level is if the PC is used for nothing other than video games and you never enter sensitive data on the keyboard or connect sensitive hardware to it. Never ever.

So yes, I'll take my VAC with occasionally encountering a cheater. I have a hard time believing you are playing against cheaters every second game."

Try going into offline games and learning new nades, watch demos and pro games to learn tips on several maps. There are also a lot of youtubers who put out great csgo content for you to learn from, ex WarOwl.

I would recommend killing 1000 bots a day, takes about 10-15 min to improve your aim significantly. Practice spray controls for the primary weapons. But most importantly try to enjoy the game and stay postive and dont overplay the game. 

What I mean by overplaying the game is not spending 130+ hours in 2 weeks since it usually tends to make you play worse in every game. 

I could also recommend surfing sometimes since it helps with your movement, remember to have proper mouse and keyboard settings to make every action more fast paced instead of using the scroll wheel. hope some of this helps and have a good day."

You need to have a plan not just for countering the enemy team but also for how you're going to respond using your tools, like your mouse and keyboard.  Seeing you say you jump at unintentional times tells me that there must be moments when the enemy knows where you are because you'll sound queue and it could be the difference of you one tapping him from behind versus him turning around and catching the off angle.  Working with teammates is huge, and having a microphone is essential for the reason that you need to make callouts in the middle of getting shot at, because again, this might be the difference between your teammate quickly avenging with a trade versus the enemy gets both of you and now has the bomb site.  It sounds to me like you've done most of what you can until your other worldly limitations are able to interfere.

if that doesnt work, an easier way is to put 2 autoexecs on your folder “crosshair1” and “crosshair2.” 1 will be normal, 2 will be the smoke chair. then you can bind 2 keys, for example:

    bind ""key"" {

        echo ""2""

    }

Is undeniably simpler than 100+ chars line (and not only for coders)

    bind ""key"" ""echo 1; echo 2; echo 3; ...""

It also greatly simplifies ""consequent commands""

    alias mycommand # { echo ""1"" }, { echo ""2"" }, { echo ""3"" }
    mycommand mycommand mycommand mycommand * outputs 1 2 3 1 *

which are often used in more complicated scripts. For example, you can create a HUD color changer in just a couple of simple lines:

    bind ""alt"" + {
        bind ""/"" # {
            cl_hud_color ""1""
        }, {
            cl_hud_color ""2""
        }, {
            cl_hud_color ""3""
        }, {
            cl_hud_color ""4""
        }, {
            cl_hud_color ""5""
        }, {
            cl_hud_color ""6""
        }, {
            cl_hud_color ""7""
        }, {
            cl_hud_color ""8""
        }, {
            cl_hud_color ""9""
        }, {
            cl_hud_color ""10""
        }
    } - {
        unbind ""/""
    }

Now you can change the color of your HUD by pressing ALT and scrolling through the variants with the slash key. It would be much, much harder and more error-prone to implement without the language:

    alias +colorchange ""bind / colorchanger""
    alias -colorchange ""unbind /""
    bind alt +colorchange
    alias colorchanger _cl_hud_color1
    alias _cl_hud_color1 ""cl_hud_color 1; alias colorchanger _cl_hud_color2""
    alias _cl_hud_color2 ""cl_hud_color 2; alias colorchanger _cl_hud_color3""
    alias _cl_hud_color3 ""cl_hud_color 3; alias colorchanger _cl_hud_color4""
    alias _cl_hud_color4 ""cl_hud_color 4; alias colorchanger _cl_hud_color5""
    alias _cl_hud_color5 ""cl_hud_color 5; alias colorchanger _cl_hud_color6""
    alias _cl_hud_color6 ""cl_hud_color 6; alias colorchanger _cl_hud_color7""
    alias _cl_hud_color7 ""cl_hud_color 7; alias colorchanger _cl_hud_color8""
    alias _cl_hud_color8 ""cl_hud_color 8; alias colorchanger _cl_hud_color9""
    alias _cl_hud_color9 ""cl_hud_color 9; alias colorchanger _cl_hud_color10""
    alias _cl_hud_color10 ""cl_hud_color 10; alias colorchanger _cl_hud_color1""

Or, for example, to implement

    bind ""key"" { echo ""two   words"" }

you will have to create two configs, while GOS will conveniently do it for you.

&amp;#x200B;

I also believe that it won't be so hard for config creators to learn this syntax to simplify their work

&amp;#x200B;

Btw if you will you can still use `bind ""key"" ""echo pressed""` or `bind ""key"" { echo ""pressed"" }`"

These guys operate on another level, and have the mechanics down almost immediately. Purely from mechanics, these level of players know where the skill ceiling is.

I never said valve was the gold standard...I don’t think i mentioned valve other than using it in an example to show how arbitrary your point was about LoL success = valorant success.

I’ve already provided you with actual evidence that it will flop, but you’ve ignored what I said, and made arbitrary points claiming them as the reason valorant will succeed.

Beta launch = 1.7 million viewers on twitch.
1 week ago   = 800k
Today             = 400k

Interest in the game is RAPIDLY declining, even while I’m closed beta, with beta keys available from multiple big name streamers.

For how new it is, the game would have had to hold much higher viewership numbers for a longer period of time. In basically 2 weeks it’s dropped 75% of its viewership. That’s REALLY BAD...really really bad; that statistic is indicative of a fad game.

Pair that with the fact that vanguards “impenetrable system” was a complete fail/lie, and you’ve got a disaster of a launch. It’s also an intrusive anti cheat that operates as a sys file on ring 0 (leaves a massive backdoor for hackers to infiltrate your entire system).

How about a bonus of the fact that RIOT is paying these streamers to play their game. Did you know that? They’re being payed to stream the game. That means the actual interest in the game isn’t as high as portrayed."

For the record, I play/love plenty of other FPS games, and am sure that valorant won’t kill established scenes in those respective games either. I’m not speaking out of concern for survival of any game.

My problem with the game, is the fact that it was marketed as the 5v5 tactical shooter, that finally solved all the big issues in CSGO. This is why I’m drawing the comparisons to CSGO. Now, if riot had delivered on that assertion, then I wouldn’t really be bothered. Yes, the game is still in beta, but the longer it takes to tighten up the game, the higher the chance of a flop. This is the honest route I predict for the game.

Streamers have already started playing much less, most active streams are replays of streams, where streamers scam thousands of dollars while dropping beta keys. The initial hype hasn’t exactly delivered, and if things aren’t fixed soon, I don’t know if it can recover. 

Viewership has already dropped by 89% since launch, and id bet a large number of the remaining 11% are idle watching stream re-runs, in order to get a key drop.

If the game doesn’t live up to its initial purpose of being the answer to all of CSGO’s problems, then you’re just left with a cartoonish version of CSGO, that is easier to play/takes less skill. At that point, the game will be a moderately played casual FPS, and definitely won’t be able to sustain an esports presence."

4,2020-04-29,u/Jimmy-Sanders,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/ga58r8/facts/fp002j5/,"Going to get downvoted to hell, so I've switched accounts here. 

I really feel like almost all of this is wrong. Being someone who's played all these games for hours upon hours, as varying as they may be, I really believe that this idea that VALORANT is just a cross between games is wrong. Let's start with Fortnite. 

I don't see how this game is like Fortnite at all. Fortnite is a battle royale third person shooter which revolves around your ability to build. Not sure where that applies to a tactical and strategic based FPS with no building and no battle royale gamemode. 

TF2 is another one I don't understand. How does the game play like TF2? We'll ignore pubs and focus on the competitive 6v6 gamemode, which revolves around 2 scours 2 sollys 1 demo 1 med, where the typical gamemode is 5CP. These matches revolve around fast movement whilst also being able to both correctly position yourself and then read the enemies plays. The midfights that occur are very much one big scrap around a point with people juking each other, and if you've ever seen it you'll know what I mean, and how none of TF2 plays out as a slow and methodical game. TF2 has a lot of strategy in it, but none of that could ever be applied to VALORANT. 

Rainbow 6 - I see this compared a lot more than the previous 2, but still don't understand why. R6 is slow and methodical like VALORANT, but the only two things that the two have in common is the ability to aim down sights and that both games revolve around information. Even then, these two things in common are very much a stretch. The sights are rarely used in VALORANT, whereas in R6, anything that's not Infront of you you'll shoot looking down sights. The sights themselves are very different. The way the game plays is very different, with one game being about attackers slowly flushing out roamers to gain control of an area whereas the other game is about directly hitting a site and then holding it or playing map control to give yourself more options. The way information is acquired is also very different, with R6S getting information via a drone that must play stealthily to ensure that it gets what it needs and not be destroyed, whereas information from VALORANT is a simple ability that can be placed down or launched in a bow. The two games again play very differently and have little similarities. 

Overwatch. The game has abilities. VALORANT has abilities. The two games abilities are very different in their usage. Overwatch's abilities are a key to success, as are VALORANTs. However, the difference here is about the way the game plays out. The abilities are designed to counter other characters abilities, which is why matches have constantly changing characters. Players can freely change their hero as much as they'd like in overwatch, so if their tracer is melting your team, maybe you'd go McCree to counter her. She sees this, and decides to swap off to another hero to try play against you. The game is constantly changing, and you keep trying to outplay the enemies picks. VALORANTs team composition is NOT around countering the other teams picks. It's about building a team that compliments each other. The fact that you can't swap mid game makes it this way. VALORANT dosent have hard counters or really any counters. VALORANT simply dosent play like overwatch does. However, there is one game that it does. 

CSGO is very similar to VALORANT. Can't deny that. The gunplay, the movement, it's all very CS like. Which personally, I'm fine with. It is CSGO with a different take. Everything else feels entirely unique, the abilities, the fights and the strategy. At its core, it's CSGO, but the extra details make it play like an entirely different game. 

I'm a big fan of both. However, I'm not converting to VALORANT. I still find CS more fun. I just really hate all the VALORANT hate coming from the CS community, it feels really unwarranted. 

-Just so I can show I know what I'm talking about, here's some stats from the games I've played:

-CSGO - 2k hours, MM rank is Supreme, Faceit level 6, ESEA B-

-Overwatch - (Not sure how many hours) Diamond DPS and Support, Masters on Tank, been playing since S1. 

-TF2 - 1.8K hours, a lot of experience in 6s and Highlander. 

-Fortnite - Have to say I haven't played this as much as the others. Played from S1-S3, then the game kinda got boring. Still watch the occasional game or two, but haven't played it since. 

-R6S - Haven't played since August 2019, but was consistently Plat 2/Plat 3 and had a 50% winrate in ESL tournaments. 

Of course, this is all just my opinion. I love CS and VALORANT, and I don't see why the two communities can't get along. The games are both fun and unique in their own ways. No game will kill the other."

I used to too much of death matches and workshop maps but less competitive matches so in the end the practice didn't help much
play more amount of competitive matches and also practice
try to practice the first few bullet of your spray in death match. you can shoot in different styles, however u want tapping, bursting or spraying.
if u are bursting practice moving between bursts, it will make it hard for opponent to hit you and u regain the accuracy. 
when you are moving and spot an enemy don't forget to stop moving by tapping opposite movement key and then shoot otherwise u will take a sec to stop even if u leave the movement key and your first bullet may miss."

In a few months i got gold 1. But the climb from gold one to MG1 (where i am now) was so hard. Not because i sucked but because you get queued with retards almost every match. i fo have some advice tho:

1. Add people in your game who speak English and play good. This way youll have someone who you know is good to play with.
2. Dont be toxic, this was the hardest one for me. If i see a degenerate playing like a monkey i cant help myself. I just have to insult that retard. But team spirit is one of the most important things is cs. Be nice and give compliments if your team does something good.
3. Be confident. Before you queue a match you have to tell yourself that no matter how bad your teammates are gonna be, you will carry them because you are a good player . Even if you arent this should help you, cs go is more about mentality and confidence then people think."

no. 2: know the economy. no matter how good your aim or gamesense is, you will not progress if you dont know economy. and thats where the term hardstuck silver comes from. anyways, not many people in matchmaking (even in higher ranks) know how to manage this, and most people just buy whatever they can every round instead of doing an eco (saving money for the next round) youtubers like TheWarOwl has countless toturials on how to not only manage economy but also play the game

no. 3: learn the basic weapons. ak-47, m4, and awp are the three most used weapons in csgo. right after sg553 and the aug that were both recently nerfed to shit. but you can expect at lower ranks, that people are going to be running at you with an smg, holding down W and MOUSE1. how do you counter this? 1. stand at range with a scoped weapon like the awp, be patient and wait untill they peak or youre told that the terrorists are attacking the other site. 2. never ever stand at close range, that is the bread and butter of smgs

no. 4: learn your maps. id suggest just learn 3 for your first 50 games or so and then start expanding. only queuing 1 map is going to take anywhere from 8 seconds to 8 decades to find a game, depending on the map and region youre queuing in. id suggest start with a normal map like mirage and learn dust 2 or inferno afterwards.

no. 5: grenade throws on all maps are key to winning and learning flashbangs and smokes can win many rounds. there are countless youtube videos on them and you can be sure to find some use in them once you learn where the cts like to stand. just dont get cocky once you have thrown a set of grenades because they dont make you invincible.

anyways thats it. there are still countless things more to learn but im not gonna continue writing this because as said multiple times there are youtube videos directed towards teaching you basic skills, and personally i like to listen to things rather than reading them. but thanks for reading and good luck ascending through the ranks! cheers!"

Valorant has very little potential of becoming a big esports contender according to many seasoned (ex-pro) gamers as it's just plain boring to watch. Just look at the streams right now; nobody is watching the game, they're just there for a key to try out the game that's so hyped and not gonna lie it's a genius marketing move from Riot, but strictly speaking from a game design PoV, Valorant is garbage.

It's kinda unreal how so many people overhype this mobile looking game which is part of a ""pump out different genres of games with the Riot brand on it and see how far we get"" strategy, even though the game offers literally no new dynamics as a game. The dynamics of Valorant literally feel like minecraft with slower csgo gun mechanics.

There is definitely for sure no way to improve your chances when bhoping in a vanilla server. You would have to be able to be accurate to within 0.01 seconds on your scrolls/key presses in order to do it 100% perfectly on a 64 tick server which is just completely and utterly infeasible. I get that you're not talking about 100% accuracy but it's still infeasible considering that people start scrolling even before they land which just proves my point about them not knowing when the tick will actually happen.

3,2020-05-05,u/_JuK3b0x_,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/gdlw6t/what_just_happened/fpjhtat/,"Also you generally don't want to peek with both forward and sideways momentum as it makes counterstrafing much difficult to execute properly.

(in case this is confusing, I have some insight here:


In CS:GO you move your character by applying force using the directional keys (WASD or the like), this means that you aren't directly in control of your speed, but rather indirectly affecting it. 

Now in order to shoot precisely you need to stand still, but when you let go of the directional keys, you do not stop immediately, but rather drift on for a while as your character loses momentum it has gained. 

You can drastically lower this period by 'counterstrafing' - pressing a key to move in the opposing direction which counteracts the movement of your character allowing you to regain weapon accuracy faster. 

When you strafe with A/D it is fairly easy to do so, simply press the other key to stop, but when you run with both say W and A at the same time, to do so would mean pressing both S and D making it way more difficult and unreliable.

There are some great videos on YT regarding these mechanics if you want to go beyond what I just said or see it in action.

Some keyboards with low roll-over may not properly process multiple key presses depending on how the roll-over is implemented in the keyboard. Originally each individual key had its own set of wires with a control chip monitoring every individual key switch, over time keys got what’s called “multiplexed” and there are some other techniques. Some keyboards only support a small number of simultaneous key presses. Not saying this is for sure your problem but it would be something to look at. Look up the specs for your keyboard and see how many keys it has for “roll-over”, if it’s n-key that means it can handle every key at the same time. If it’s a small number it could be dividing the keyboard in to sections and the keys you are using could be in the same section and causing a conflict, ctrl-w isn’t necessarily a common shortcut that I’m aware of for everyday computing (like ctrl-c/v for copy/paste) so the keyboard manufacturer may not have foreseen that as an issue. Again this is just speculation and something to investigate"

 I like the steelseries apex series for keyboard and for the mouse for me at least its logitech g pro or g900/g903.
But im still a silver and i dont think you need these to get better or have a better rank.

Or watch the LinusThechTips vid on cheap 144hz gaming monitor!

Just yesterday, I (a measly silver 2) got matched against SMEs and GN2s which just sucks. Low to mid silver games are riddled with smurfs and returning players who have deranked, which is stucky for us who are now getting deranked because of this stuff. Be lucky if everyone in our team has mics even

With managing toxicity the main things to do is turn down your voice scale and bind a button to mute everybody. Both of these are console commands.

To adjust the voice scale (how loud team comms are), put into the console ""voice_scale"" followed by 0-1 based on how high you want it (I have mine between 0.5-0.75 most of the time.

To bind a button to mute everybody, bind a button to the commtand ""voice_enable_toggle. I've set mine to the 'u' key, so I put ""bind u voice_enable_toggle"" into the console. This will mean that whenever they're spamming the mic or yelling at you in a clutch, you can hit the button and get on with it. Just remember to unmute when you're done ... that's if you want to at least

A very important thing with managing toxicity is to not, under any circumstances, be toxic back. If they team kill your other teammates and even you, they'll get kicked sooner or later for too many kills or damage. Even if they're getting in your way, blocking you, sit back, wait for either them to stop or the other team to come and kill you all. Ultimately, toxicity relies on a response and a reaction, and if you give them none them they might stop. Also, if you manage to lower your trust factor, your games will become more and more toxic, so it's important that you don't if you want to get out of this

For me, staying cool usually involves staying silent unless you really need to comm something. If you need to, individually mute people on your team who never give any info, and make sure you mute the enemy team so if they send toxic stuff you don't see it. My mindset usually revolves around that even if my teammates are bad, it doesn't make you any worse of a player. You'll need to play the game on a more individual level, going for picks (not crazy ones tho), solo-holding sites, etc, and relying on you and only yourself as much as you can. You still need to play somewhat as a team tho, but you'll need to be more flexible. Me myself am a b player, but half the time I have to play a because three go b every round. And I've won a lot of 1vX situations in toxic teams because I've just stopped, hit my mute key, focused on the game and played, just like I know I can. At the end of the day, you can't really play as a team if they're not either. And if they're playing only on an individual level, you still should try play as a team, but don't rely on anyone unless you have to.

At the end of the day, you've proven that your better than your rank tells, and sure, they're bringing you down now, but you'll get a break one day, maybe even using something like ESEA or FaceIt might be the solution for you, even temporarily until you can solo comfortably get out of silver. Just remember, like a lot of people out there, even me to an extent, you've got what's needed to keep climbing the ladder that is matchmaking.

I know this is a long message, but I hope it helps."

However, about the abilities, it is actually a great feature imo (once the balance is set).

What I say is that the nature of the game is an unsolvable equation. It's like trying to mix water and oil together. It doesn't go along. Proof of that is that every main issues (like I've already pointed out) of the game derive from one problem : Trying to mix abilities with CS:GO. And of course CS:GO tweaks stuff around, but the main difference is that they're trying to solve a solvable equation, but Riot is trying so hard to solve the unsolvable.

""However, about the abilities, it is actually a great feature imo (once the balance is set). Riot basically takes Overwatch's approach but makes it more tactical (since Overwatch is just a giant mess of abilities and no skill required whatsoever, I hate *that* specifically).""

The abilities can't be a good feature since it creates so many big unsolvable problems. I've never played OW so I can't speak about it.

""You also have to consider that a lot of people who have invested thousands of hours into CS are bored of it, and would like to get a fresh breath of air with the abilities in Valorant (I might be wrong, some people may disagree with me here).

Trust me nobody is bored of CS:GO. It's like saying that people are bored of football, just because it's been around for hundreds of years. If the game is good and has no realistically reachable skill ceiling, it'll be around forever. And again Valorant by nature can't be balanced. Do you want to know what is tactical hardcore shooter that's balanced? CS. Simply CS. But, if Riot doesn't come with something ""original"" it'll be hard to sell the game, so they've had to add abilities which was the dumbest thing ever. If Valorant had only utilities just like CS it'll be the best game out of the two, because all the problems mentioned before wouldn't exist and the game will actually be owned by a company that really cares about their games..."

Don't get me wrong, the CS awp is good for peeking, but it doesn't let you run around while scoped. This feature allows you to pre aim angles with the scope in and just delete anyone that stands in your death line.

I think the main thing is nobody uses the Operator like this because it seems like the strictly incorrect thing to do. It seems too stupid to scope in, then peek the angle while running, but it works. I have to think to use the AWP, I have to hold W, A, or D to use the Operator."

Best thing to do is just hop into competitive and play. 

Practice your crosshair placement. Never look down, always have your crosshair at head height.

When you’re shooting someone who’s far away, fire in bursts or tap, never spray. When near, spray. When spraying, move your crosshair down as bullets rise as you spray. While spraying you should be aimed at their feet so the spray hits their body or head. Try to learn some common smokes such as the CT and stairs smoke on Mirage from T spawn. Try to practice holding angles and working on your positioning. All these things should help. 
CSGO is much harder then Valorant. Hitboxes are smaller and there are more things to worry about in terms of angles and utility. Practice is key. I got lucky bc my friend is global and taught me how to play."

Thanks for the help, I know a bit of cross hair placement because I have 800 hours on Rainbow Six but are there any ways I can practice spray patterns?"

Hell only spent $25 on a mechanical keyboard and mouse kit and they still work. Sold the keyboard to a friend who wanted to buy it for $20 so I have a $5 mouse that has lasted 3000hrs of pure gaming. My friend who uses Logitech on the other hand has replaced 4 mouses in the past 3 years. Cheap and Chinese doesn’t necessarily mean low quality and horrible

I've switched to a Razer Deathadder then and I can't even remember when it was that I've got it, same with Black Widow keyboard. I think they are 2013 models but I'd have to check and I'm not at home right now. I know they are not $20 but god damn it I had beer spilled on them over the year at least twice (gave the keyboard a proper deep cleaning) and they are working fuckin' perfectly. Best money spent ever.

Same stuff with Logitech G35 I think, the very first series. I've replaced them after 7+ years but if I had the chance to get the very same model I'd not hesitate."

Anyway, I dug a little deeper myself. I've attempted the following and problem still exists:

* turn off CPU virtualization in the BIOS
* disabled GSync in the NVidia drivers
* disabled FreeSync on my monitor
* disabled XMP profile for my RAM
* turned off my overclocked profile in MSI Afterburner, GPU is now running per factory/stock
* performed a Windows Memory Diagnostic with no errors
* reinstalled Steam
* reinstalled CS:GO
* crash has occurred on maps de_chlorine, de_infurno, de_vertigo, de_anubis - possible related to defuse maps?


I've also installed Windows Debugger (WinDbg Preview 10.0.19528.1000) and had it analyze the dump files. In every case, it appears ""engine.dll"" is causing an INVALID_POINTER_WRITE_ONE_BIT error. See below. Perhaps it is some sort of stack overflow issue.

I've started a new support ticket with Steam Support and hopefully they will forward what I found to the devs.

Private schools are ussually better but it costs a lot. And if someone doesn't have enough money to afford it, they have to register to government schools, and since government schools are free, the teachers are usually worse. They don't have national English speakers like we do, and as far as I know most of them are learning some eastern languages like Arabic, or others so they can't really focus on English as much as we can. And the answer to your second question, I really don't know an accurate answer but to guess, Turks mostly play CS as crews, at least with 4 people. And they are probably gonna bully the fifth player because there is literally 4 Turks and a perfect environment to bully the fifth guy. But maybe that is not the case.

Sounds like it is worth it to just buy prime though. When I got this ban it was from a game which my teammate started the vote (his f1 key was broken so he said he couldn’t vote unless he called it). Idk if it counted that or if I just had this cool down pending beforehand. 

I understand that in some circumstances kicking teammates would be bad, like kicking low skill teammates and not giving them the opportunity to grow (which I don’t do). However, I feel like the current implementation this feature encourages players to keep the cheaters on their team. As it currently stands, at least from what I have heard from players in game, right now cheaters are able to use .lua scripts to completely avoid Ow and bans. With that exploit in game, kicking is really the only option to make the game fair. I hope in the future valve either fixes ow or removes this reason for cool down."

But as others have said CSGO has a perfectly even playing field which is key to its competitive success and you’ll just never really get that with valorant; maybe if they made gunplay more CoD and less CSGO it would work better in its favor."

okay, so turns out switching drivers back to 442.74 fixed the fps problem, Im back to 240-300 fps! hooraayy, thanks alien for the help.

For those who are having the same issue here is how you fix it.

1. Download DDU from here: [https://www.wagnardsoft.com/content/display-driver-uninstaller-ddu-v18025-released](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.wagnardsoft.com/content/display-driver-uninstaller-ddu-v18025-released)
2. Download Nvidia Graphics drivers 442.74 from here: [https://www.geforce.com/drivers](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.geforce.com/drivers)(make sure to enter the correct details of your graphics card)
3. open DDU, there should be a prompt for you to restart in safe mode, click to restart in safe mode. If a prompt does not pop up, press your windows key + R and type in msconfig. Head over to boot and select safe boot with the option minimal ticked. then restart your PC
4. Once in safe mode open DDU and click the clean and restart, let DDU do its thing and you should reboot into windows again. If you did not reboot into windows and instead are still in safe mode, go back to msconfig and go over into boot and untick safe boot and restart.
5. once back into windows go to where ever you saved your graphics driver 442.74 and click on it to install. from there everything should go back to normal and you should be able to play CSGO at above 200 fps!

If this helped you please comment that it helped so others can see this thanks. 📷

Thats what I have done, join some tournaments what would have organizations playing in it, sometimes get an offer to play for them after showing my skills, then maybe to get a chance player higher skill level qualifyers etc. About 3 years but I know I dont have drive to go full pro because there's other jobs to do than be on an entertaiment based job what CS and other sports are."

1.) FIRST PRIORITY: Counterstrafing. You do this before you shoot ANY bullets (non SMG / shotgun weapons)

2.) Watch war owl perspectives video

3.) Right eye peeking

4.) Bunny hop tutorial. Dont have to hit the hops but you HAVE to be able to jump and let go of W key and use A + (move mouse left)    =OR=     D + (move mouse right) to gain speed. YES, you GAIN SPEED while you are midair and 'syncing your movement with mouse movement. In other words on the ground you move 250 with knife out but if you jump + synch movement you can go faster than that 250 speed cap.

5.) Plant vs after plant spots. How to play a 1v1 when the bomb is down and you are a T. So when you plant the bomb, your plant spot should be dictated by where you will try to hide afterwards. Be close enough that you can hear the defuse kit beep when they start the defuse. Wait 3 seconds then peek out (usually you move only a few steps because of good positioning) then shoot them in the face ORRRRRRR get them to shoot one bullet or move 1 step. You will either kill them or get them off the defuse. If they get off the defuse you need to jump back into cover and just wait till you hear the beep again, wait 3s, then do the same thing. This will both kill the most amount of time, make you harder to deal with, and give you the best chance of winning. If you are the CT you should understand this is how you 'optimally' play the situation, and either bring a smoke to defuse with or try to just sneakily kill the last T by making a good guess on where he wants to hide given a certain plant spot.

6.) Know how to trade kills. And position well. DO NOT be a baiter. Dont watch your teammate die or wait for your teammate to move before you do so you can bait him. TRADING kills is different than BAITING for kills. In rare situations a bait might be worth it but you wont be to this level of play until much much later so dont bait!

7.) Learn how to running right click toss a flash bang and have it land behind you when you are peeking out. You can use flashbangs with right click + (forward momentum) running in almost every situation. Lets say you are on inferno at the top of middle pushing as a T. You can throw the flash bang right click while running to the right side of top mid, then peek out and look to the left (with good timing, takes 3s to pop) and force your opponent to either try to fight you while blind or look away while you peek into them.  


8.) DO NOT open crates. Want a weapon? Save your $$$ and buy it. Dont be that dumbf\*ck kid who tries to rationalize burning 99% of his $$$ because 'its fun to gamble hurrrrrr'. So many f\*cking morons in this community get hooked on gambling, and lose a shit load of money and end up spending sooo much and getting essentially nothing in return. Want a skin? BUY IT. [cs.money](https://cs.money) is a good website. DO NOT go to [cs.money.com](https://cs.money.com) its DIFFERENT. Obviously the steam market is okay to use, too. If you get any items that are decent make your inventory private. NEVER add randoms to avoid getting scammed. NEVER log into random websites. NO they dont want you to play in a tourney, its a scam. If it seems like it might be bullshit, its bullshit. DONT get scammed.

And lastly. DO NOT play competitive until you have 500 hours MINIMUM under your belt AND have ALL (100%) of your core game mechanics down very well. Or you WILL 100% chance f%ck up your rank 'health'. There is NO WAY to fix this problem, currently. Other than making a new account. Which is a pain in the ass."

So, one thing I noticed is that your keyframes for things like pan/crop and the scope transition are a little rigid. In After Effects and Premiere, you can press F9 to 'easy ease' your keyframes which makes them look much smoother. Vegas has an equivalent to this you can use by right clicking your keyframes and choosing the option you want. Here's a [video](https://vimeo.com/5936542) explaining, but really it's just 'fast' 'slow' etc. But it will make any keyframing look a lot smoother. This will definitely improve the flow of the edits.

And yeah, CC a lot of the time comes down to personal preference. I use Magic Bullet Looks, which is a plugin for both AE and Vegas. Imo it's the best colour corrector, but it's a little tricky to learn. You could also use LUTs to tweak individual colours, but MBL has that built in. I'd highly recommend it man"

800 / 2.5$ = 320 cases.

The chance of getting a knife in a case is 0.26%.

This means the probability of not getting a knife is 99.74%. (Because 99.74 + 0.26 = 100%)

If we calculate it, the chance of getting 1 knife is:

1-0.9974^320 ≈ 57% (I used 1 - ... because if 99.74 is the chance of not getting a knife then the inverse is the chance of getting a knife.)

So the chance of getting 2 knifes is:

0.57 * 0.57 ≈ 32%.

So you hit about a 1/3 chance by getting 2 knifes :)

Edit: the chance is more like 1/6"

5,2020-07-16,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/hsedjg/reason_why_your_trust_factor_is_low_horrible/fya0gc1/,"I tested 9 accounts

First account I played normally on deathmatch without pressing Windows key while the character is moving.

I played Wingman, there are no cheaters at all.

Second account, I played on deathmatch and press Windows key while the character is moving for 1 times.

I played Wingman, there are wallers.

Third account, I played on deathmatch and press Windows key while the character is moving for 10 or more times.

I played Wingman, there are spinbotters ready to hvh

The rest of the accounts that I test repeat the processes above and found accurate result.

So in conclusion:

Short explanation: Running, jumping or walking while instantly clicking windows key or alt+tab will instantly wrongfully cause low trust factor in any gamemodes except workshop map.

Long explanation: Whenever the character CSGO has any form of movement momentum such as jump run or walk. The momentum is still lingering. While the momentum is still ongoing and the user click windows key simultaneously, the character will have movement while CSGO is tab out to Windows. Vacnet will then assume that user has a walkbot because there are still movements momentum while CSGO is being tab out. Vacnet will then wrongfully put user in low trust factor. This happen in both full screen and borderless windows.

Usually, this problem can occur if player accidently click Windows key while their character is moving.

So my solution right now is to disable Windows and Alt+Tab keys while in CSGO. After that, my trust factor go back to green and never met any cheaters and recently got a rank up.

Valve please fix"

1,2020-07-16,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/hsedjg/reason_why_your_trust_factor_is_low_horrible/fya5hpz/,"I know exactly why but it is a bit difficult to explain but I will try.

Because Vacnet will think that you have a walkbot.

Walkbot will automatically move your character automatically. It is a tool for people who want to get to level 2 fast to play competitive or simple generic tool for derankers. Usually, 99% of the time, users who possess walkbot have cheat.

Vacnet will detect any movement while CSGO is close or tab out via alt+tab or Windows key.

For example, if you are able to move around and headshot people while CSGO is being tab out, which is impossible which mean you 100% have walkbot and aimbots.

Valve will detect movements or aim movements while CSGO is being tab out which is a great feature to bring these kind of people to low trust.

BUT

Valve made a huge mistake.
When you press aswd to move or you press spacebar to jump. You still have some movement lingering left. You don't instantly stop while when you lift your finger from aswd. And, you certainly won't stop and freeze on mid air when you are jumping.

Valve then mistakenly detect these lingering movements and wrongfully believe that the user is using walkbot when user press alt+tab or Windows key to tab out of CSGO.

That's is what trigger low trust factor.

Remember, alt+tab or Windows key alone won't bring you to low trust, you have to have movement via aswd or jumping in mid-air and instantly simultaneously press alt+tab or Windows key to trigger low trust.

The more times you do that, the more trust factor penalties you will receive.

Valve please fix"

1- Adjusting your video settings, trying to get the maximum framerate that you can

2-Seeing if your aspect ratio suits you, for example I play on 4:3 and its much easier for me

3-I would warm up 20-30 Minutes against bots in a custom game. There's a lot of different custom maps made for practicing. First practice doing One taps on the head, so you get used to flicking between targets, then focus on spraying enemies, learn the pattern of the Ak-47, giving 20-30 minutes every day to practice will make your skills skyrocket.

4-I would focus on some maps (1-3 maps and focus on them), pick the maps that tou like the most, and focus in learning how to correctly play it:
 -For example if you play CT Inferno, learn to play a single site, and then the other. Start by learning how to control the Banana so the enemy doesnt rush, for example by throwing a molotov against the wall close range(On banana right after the barrels) and then following it with a nade, then falling back to site and waiting for the enemy team to push, so then you smoke it off and waste a lot of time for the enemy. That's just an example.
Playing intelligently is the key. And learning how to correctly utilize utility is a life changer.

5-Playing premade will make you not get frustrated so much, and will make it quite easier to defend and atack in synch.

There is definitely a lot of other things that I can tell you. But remember to have fun, and if you want to go beyond that, be prepared to put some time in to practice!"

Now if you u are not using Nvidia and you u are using AMD, i think they have a similar recording software too, just google it because i use Nvidia. And there is no watermark or anything. Check my video in my profile, you will see how good it is. Now remember, this is only for recording your video. If you want to edit, then use Adobe Premiere Pro or Sony Vegas Pro. Both are paid software but you can download it from torrents for free (I know it's not the most ethical thing to do). I use Premiere Pro and it's pretty good.

Think about how the Howl works in particular. It's Contraband so there is literally no way to increase the supply. With CSGO re-surging in popularity the demand for this skin in particular is almost guaranteed to increase. My reasoning behind this is simple economics:    
    
Supply will steadily be decreasing. Sure, some collectors might try and cash out to profit on it. But, the CS community is currently stronger than ever according to steamcharts, meaning, there are people trying CSGO for the first time and eventually they will come across skins. The first 2 **GUN** skins that most new CSGO players learn about are the Dragon Lore and the Howl. Both legendary skins, key difference being that it is still possible to unbox a Dragon Lore, even if the starting price for a Cobblestone souvenir package is about $470 USD on the steam market. Even if only 10% of these new players ever start seriously trading and buying skins, that a rather large increase in demand with an already limited supply. This clearly indicates to me that the price for a Howl will rise in the long term and probably significantly so. Obviously there is risk involved. The biggest risk and only *loosely* plausible one is: Valve being Valve they could decide to release a new CS game at any point, bringing a new skin based economy with it which would tank the CSGO economy. But I don't see them abandoning an entire multi-million (potentially billion) dollar economy that they created. If a new CS comes out Valve will likely transfer the skins to the new game in order to avoid alienating part of the player base, but also because its a large revenue stream for them. IF they released a new CS and tried to start a new economy all over again, people would be weary and not invest nearly as much in the new skins as they did with CSGO because they would have seen what happened with CSGO skins. That's also ignoring the possibility that it becomes a 1.6 vs Source split again, but that's a whole other topic that would make things much more intricate.

If you are motivated to play cs you can do it but be aware that there are many things that valve hasnt fixed yet like cheaters and boosting services. If you are to do what i said then you could get somebody to play with or play solo which i dont actually enjoy its your choice after all , in your way up to level 21 be sure to only play scrimmage maps and avoid being toxic or making people angry its for fun so dont rage , also you should try to find your favourite weapon in-game like rifle(ak or m4) or an awp depending on you which is better for you , try aim_botz map you could search it on the internet and download it , you can also search on youtube about daily rutines and styles of training your raw aim , you must aim at the head to kill someone faster so make sure you got the reflexed , training is key in this game so you could train like 30mins a day and try to get better aim. After you have prime you become to know more about the game and know what is your rank and your goal , depending on your goal you can either become a casual player or a better and better one  make sure to grind alot , one day you will make a faceit account since matchmaking is bad and doesnt represent skill at all or it does but rarely. You need to train before you play to be better , after that you can play more or not your choice but if you feel that you play worse than last time you need to train and also another thing about the game you must speak english in game , communication is key in game , in serious matches you need to say any piece of information that can help you win the game or round.

I just spent a few hours setting up CSGO to run 30fps on an old Dell Inspiron with an older version of Intel HD graphics. 

Once you get Steam and CSGO installed run CSGO and go into the game menu and enable the console. Once enabled activate the console by pressing the ` key. Enter the command net_graph 1 and it will display the frames per second, ping, and other game information. This can be turned off with net_graph 0 in console. 

To get more FPS try the following settings and system maintenance. On the computer take a look at the power plan and make sure it is set to maximum performance. Play CSGO with the laptop plugged in and not while on the laptop battery. You might want to update the Intel graphics driver. In the Intel graphics menu look for settings that say prefer max performance over quality. I don't know anything about Linux Mint, but hopefully its a lot less bloated than windows and doesn't have tons of back ground processes running. You might want to look into Linux OS specific tutorials to get the system running better. You would probably see the biggest improvement from using a SSD instead of a HDD. It would load maps faster but wouldn't help with FPS unless your system is struggling with memory and causing HDD activity that would cause hitching during gameplay when a system is struggling with performance. 

In the game menu go to Video settings and set the resolution to the lowest setting possible just to see if the FPS improves. Most players use a lower resolution anyway because it increases FPS and makes it easier to get headshots in the game in my opinion. Set all the graphics settings on low. Try using multithreaded on and see if it helps improve the FPS. Disable vsync. Go through the mouse settings and set mouse acceleration to off to keep a constant and consistent mouse movement to better develop muscle memory for repeatable aim. Set the mouse sensitivity to something you are comfortable with. I usually set mine to where if I jump and move the mouse a comfortable distance I land exactly 180 degrees facing the opposite direction. Then over time I decrease it slightly to improve forward fine aim control. There is a lot more to mouse sensitivity, but I'm assuming you don't have a gaming mouse. If you do then you will have to try out different DPI and Polling values and see what works best for you. I also recommend setting the crosshair to be a dot and not a crosshair and making it static and not dynamic. Then learn how to tap and burst the rifles for recoil control and how to pull down the recoil pattern for each rifle.

If CSGO is still only playing around 30 FPS there are more advanced things you can do to try to get the best experience possible playing CSGO on integrated Intel HD graphics, but I would recommend doing a google search and following a FPS tutorial for CSGO. It will give you a list of more advanced launch option commands in Steam that do actually work. The goal is at least 30 to 60 FPS. Get a lightweight gaming headset that has a hardware mute switch like mute when rotating the mic boom up. This game is all about sound. Where are the foot steps and where are fire fights happening. It is possible to actually play CSGO on a laptop with Intel Integrated HD graphics, but it takes some effort to get playable FPS. Good luck."

I used to play 1.6 on a Pentium 166 with the lowest res possible, and then by using the ""-"" key making the screen box size as small as possible. Would get about 5fps. Crosshair was misaligned.

But I still got kills . Still had fun."

Putting everything in one autoexec file is nice, but also has drawbacks. Mainly the fact that you can't just write methods like in java. Swapping between different crosshairs for example is doable in one config. However, if you want it to be easily readable or changeable, its gonna use a LOT of alias commands.

You CAN play scrims, thats totally fine. Just DONT play 'ranked' competitive. Honestly swamp/mutiny are really well made maps.

2.) Practice counterstrafing. Learn that first.

3.) Watch 'war owl : perspectives' video on youtube.

4.) Learn how to bunny hop. You dont have to learn how to hop but you should be in the habit of letting go of ""W"" when you are airborne and using A/D and mouse to strafe / turn (because you literally gain speed in the air if you airstrafe properly).

5.) Learn about 'right eye peeking'.

6.) Practice Team Death Match every single day to learn mechanics and get your counterstrafing down.

7.) USE TEAMWORK when you play casual or scrims. If youre a terrorist you should 100% of the time be going with your team. Dont be that dumbf#ck kid who blows d#ck at the game and thinks hes 'too good' to go with the team. Seriously. Just go with the team. If you die by a teammate he can get a 'trade kill' and your death wont be for nothing. If youre off doing god knows what on the other side of the map, your death is meaningless, and your kills are meaningless. So BE A TEAMMATE. This isnt call of f#cking duty. Its CSGO: A TEAM GAME.  


8.) Set up an 'autoexec.cfg'. In there you should bind jump to both mouse wheel and spacebar, have a quickswitch button for Q (not mandatory, but recommended), and have a jump+throw bind for grenade lineups. You should learn how to code a little bit. Dont worry, its not hard at all. Seriously 0/10 difficulty, and most of the sh#t you learn is easily found on google or youtube. You should also have grenades individually bound. Dont be that dopey f#ck who has scroll wheel for 99% of their inventory. I use mousewheel up for pulling knife out, and mousewheel down for jumping so I can do a lot of movement tricks with just my mouse wheel and mouse (and A/D on my keyboard when Im airborne). Hopefully you have a mouse that has some buttons on the side. 1 should be for push to talk, and the other for like... smoke grenade.   


9.) Speakin a which, always buy a smoke grenade. Its OP as f#ck. Also learn how to right click grenades. Watch a video on how to use flashbangs.   


10.) Make an grenade practice .cfg file. So you can open console and type in 'exec smoke' and it will set up an offline bot match to have infinite grenades and such. (youtube will help you here). Just practice throwing flashbangs and peeking with them, and throwing smokes into certain spots, and how to use right click nades. And left+right click to 'medium toss' nades. And how to jump and throw a nade while you are moving upwards to make your trajectory change into a more upwards one (really good with right click nades). Same is true with movement. When you throw a grenade you HAVE TO be walking exactly forward ONLY when you toss nades.   


11.) If you like a certain map, learn a few smoke lineups. Takes no skill to learn, just memorization. Your jump throw bind will come in handy here. Some lineups need jumpthrow."

Nooby plays just Crouch for this effect but lower ranks dont sim for head, sim for cheast, if u Crouch u Crouch into a headshot"

This meme plays on the fact that a lot of players use this keybind to also unscope the sniper after a shot so they can scope whenever they see fit, instead of after a fixed amount because of the recocking of the awp.

It usually goes like this: you are scoped and shoot someone, tap q and now you are unscoped and ready to shoot someone else. 

It also has the added bonus that you can silently unscope this way. Right mouse button would play the “salt shaker” sound"

bind &lt;key&gt; ""slot3; lastinv""

Should do the trick.

You can replace lastinv with something like slot1 if you only want to switch back to your primary.

Edit: I forgot to mention the script I use.
The issue with the bind is that you need to press the key twice to do the trick.

You could use something like -

alias ""+quickswitch""  ""slot3""
alias ""-quickswitch"" ""lastinv""
bind &lt;key&gt; ""+quickswitch""

You need to place this in your autoexec , since you need to define aliases everytime you launch the game."

As one of the key players of ‚P90Fuckers‘ I only can recommend to use the weapon at some point. My buddies and me introduced the cache p90 b rush tactic and this worked better than we ever expected. We won between 12-8 rounds per match for t-side, because most ppl, even in higher ranks like mge or dmg did not know how to stop us. Instead of handling us they were crying:“mimi noob weapon“. I was always surprised, because after the second rush these players could have been prepared.
As a bonus, the enemies started to hate each other, if they lose against 5 man p90 rush.

The conclusion: The p90 is actually a highly situative weapon and will work worse with every rank you earn (till DMG, but not higher). However it is sometimes funny to troll the enemy with such weapons, because they cannot handle such rushes."

Try to get rid of bad behaviour like useless rushing 5 man banana stack it will matter if you try to climb. Don't over hunt for that 1 left kill most of the time enemy will have Los bonus so even if you kill him it will not matter and maybe hurt you're economic more than the enemy.

On CT don't overpush if CT on inferno there is no reason to push down banana we 5 Terotirst alive and  even than if you die you potentially give the enemy a free weapon and a b plant. When you defending try to change up you're postinging if sit in the Same corner every round player will adjust to that and just prefire it even if the blinded or somked is just essay so spam a corner. If you switch you're positions call it to your team speczialy if you holding something like connector on mirage so you're mades on spot don't get fck from behind. If you want to defend a other spot ask someone if he switch with you so you not end up with 5 players on b in round start. Comucitae clear just call what you see not what you think. If die just make you call and the be silent you're teammates have a headset to. And nobody likes it to get scream at by 4 dead people just let them play. If you're team talks to mustch just mute them. And for god sake use the shift key don't be that elefant how gets shot every time. Peaking peak ones to get info twice to kill. Never peak a AWP twice in the Same angle. Learn the money management is the most important part.        Ant the last hero moves sometime you want to do a flashy play like push down mid it will works one time maybe twice but the enemy will adjust to it and will just get a free kill on you plus the opening to push the spot. 1 AWP per is enough. Sometimes if you have to clutch planting enemy's and you last alive switch the AWP for a other weapon like ak or something we are unfortunately not kennys or JW so a p90 M4 ak will usually kill a bloting AWP if it is alone and not at a super long angle. Try to get rid of bad behaviour like useless rushing 5 man banana stack it will matter if you try to climb. Don't over hunt for that 1 left kill most of the time enemy will have Los bonus so even if you kill him it will not matter and maybe hurt you're economic more than the enemy.

That's how you properly learn the game because it involves team play and tactics and is fast paced. If you want to improve your aim, look for ""ffa"". That means free for all and is a better death match mode than the regular game's one.

Oh, and watch tutorials on how to improve and some pro matches and try to adapt their play style as good as possible. CSGO is 90% game sense, the aim and spray control comes naturally. 

And get a headset so you can communicate with your team. You might wanna remind the push to talk key to something that you can press fast and without letting go of WASD and dont be afraid to use comms.

1,2020-10-12,u/DeusXNorus,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/j8ws3m/why_people_like_csgo/g8kpq21/,"Simply becoose is has the most refined gameplay. Is a game how the time you putting in to memorize maps. To learn weapon patterns and smoke are matter. There are no equals to experience ins this game no noob protection and least amount of rng you can get in a shooter. And if you ever get a one deag in a 1v1 wen it stands 15-14 for you team you will understand the beauty of this game. Csgo will teasch you every thing you need to know about shooter 1. Recoil management simple maintain a low dpi about between 800 and 1200 effective dpi some main awps used to play high dpi but I do not recommend being a main AWP if you do not play with 4 of you're friends losing an AWP can lose a game sometimes. You will learn how to analyse and abuse the strength of a weapon recoil patterns in cs are not Radom if you stand still but most of the time 3 shots should be enough for a enemy. you will carve the patterns of you're weapons into you're muscle memory so you will reasch a point how you can truly trust you're aim
 2. Economie you will learn to manage the money and hp pool you have since you only have 100 hp a useless rush will come at a cost. The management of weapon armorand utility like smoke and flashes comes to play. 3. Map arwareness comes to play memoryzing angles and vision lines on maps you will slowly build up a spider sense to a point how you can read the enemy. 
4. Communication since csgo is a team game you will and need learn to communicate with them. Making clear call outs and only telling what you know not what you thing all b wen you only see 3 players are not a good call I might will open a crack in the defensive of you're team. Call what you will do request for eco rounds or stacks say what position you want to play. So you don't end up with a 5 man scout stack on middle. 

5. Mind games sometimes you will encounter enemy's how have a same skills as you that are usually most fun games becoose both teams have to do some tricks like taking a push on some point or double triple faking. The hardes mind games a 1v2 situation how you have to make noise to distract them or fake flash by trowing Ur pistol becoose you have no flashgenades left. Man reading the enemy is a big part of cs


After you master all this you will be able shine in most fps and surpass the most player with ez. Becoose you not only rely on your aim but also at your skill to turn a situation in you're favour by manypolating you're fight with position and desition making. That's the reason why most csgo players a feart on fpsgames. Don't be to harsh to u self at the start we all were silver strash for sometime. But if you a wild to improve you will quickly realise that cs refined to fps skills. 


To archive the get gud every body is talking about I recommend watching warowl guides on YouTube he explains everything about cs go you need to know 


I can understand every player how say I don't want to spend several hundred hours to archive that get gud. And for them are the casual shooters like cod and battlefield but there have a loot of rng in terms of patterns and a high ttk. Since most of them are only required a fast reflextime. There guns king of feel all the same and poorly have character. 



At least some Tipps to get started with cs

1. Play low dpi
2. Play with a static crosshair
3. Use you're shift key to walk without sound and get a headset to hear that rhinos
4. Watch you're economie don't buy AWP if there all ready one on you're team
5. Smokes are not walls player and bullets can surpass them
6. Make call outs and learn the names of positions.
7. Don't dead talk if you die call what's kills you and there like 1 CT apps mag-7. Give usefully Infos if 5 enemy's are alive the position of that guy is more important that that you made 50 damage to him. Never dead talk like is bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb. Is likely youre teammates have a headset to. Mute people how give trash call or dead talk to mutch( not the hol map is callt ct^^ ) 
8. If you're thing somebody might cheats report them and than play you're best, guys with walls can usually be ez baited in a bad position becoose the want to get that essay kill. Don't talk with cheaters questions his mother origins will not make him stop.
9. Switch position don't do the same shit every round 5 man banane etc the enemy will adapt to that and ez prefire you.

It's the same reason they won't make the anti-cheat changes people have requested for pro matches (i.e. ""fresh"" peripherals for players, cameras on mouse / keyboard and logs for keypress etc): if they made those changes, and pros were caught cheating, that would SERIOUSLY fuck with their cash from these tournaments.

At 35-36, LEM was my highest and I didn't deserve it. I must have achieved that from playing drunk/high kids. Those days are over. I stopped playing for 4-5 years, came back, forgot how to really play. The game even looks and feels different.  Needless to say, I wasn't LEM anymore.  To my credit, I am playing WiFi and hit registry varies with it. It started me at MG2 and kids I played w/ were saying I must have gotten boosted :D

I remember playing the original CS in beta pre-steam. Back then there were WONIDs (World Opponent Network) and I didn't even have the game. A friend lent me their CDKey, but you could also use CDKey Cracks -- that's how simple and stupid the tech was back then.  My IDs were low when I finally purchased.

We would play it after school. Some kids that knew how to hack would be perusing WindowsXP code for an admin password or opening... they eventually got it and were able to install the game on school computers. Nothing beat those days when you would go home, play CS for a few hours on original Dust, and then rag on your friends for camping the dugout near spawn.

A few of those kids went pro-am. Not me. I was better than some, but with WiFi 802.11B back then, it was always another wrench in the wheel of reliability.  Today, with enough coffee or the right amount of booze, some things come back.  At this age, how you sit in your chair (using sidearm or sitting forward) can make all the difference.

That said, I bought a new account to try and work my way up. I can't even join a competitive match (as a 5-man or solo) even with setting ping to 250.  When I do join a match (after 20 mins) it ends up being HVH and I'm at a lost. It seems everyone cheats now, even in casual or on deathmatch -- what's the point? Sigh.

If you’re peeking the enemy, it might be that your movement is giving them easy shots while giving you harder shots. You need to be moving perpendicular to their line of sight using only one movement key where possible. You also need your crosshair placed exactly where they might be if they were to appear on your screen at that moment.

If you’re being peeked, it could be that they’re doing the above to you. You shouldn’t be sat still on an angle unless you have an AWP or a headshot angle, otherwise their crosshair placement will be right on you and you’ll get headshot as soon as they see you. Instead, you can peek-unpeek, where you stay completely hidden and every few seconds peek out with your crosshair correctly placed to see if anyone’s there. This works because they’ll pre-aim your angle, clear it and then when they no longer have their crosshair placed for you, you peek out and kill them.

Utility usage can also help a lot. Blind enemies can’t aim at you."

Work on crosshair placement my man is flickin left and right

Learn the recoil control, try using workshop maps they work wonders

You're movement is good and counter strafing shouldnt be something i would worry about right now, just try and stand still more

Get keybinds for guns and nades, should help in clutch situations and make the game more practical, you can look into using scrollwheel for jump but its all personal preference

Try and not reload after each kill like a cod player, you will notice this will fuck you up a lot in higher ranks because there will almost always be someone who try and get the trade for their teammate after you get the kill... my advice is try and only reload near 10 bullets cus if it takes 10 bullets to kill someone you deserve to die

Please tell you're teammates to make comms and shut up🤣

Positives:

Your aim is on point and you got tap and burst firing down

You peek angles very well for a silver and you might not notice it but you peekin wide like a pro"

For example if a new collection of skins drop out the prices might go up or down, since people will use the market more etc. If you sell the skin via steammarket the money will go to into your steam wallet. People often want their money on their bank so what you can do is sell it outside the steammarket. If people add you and ask you stuff about your knife, just don't bother, ignore them since they will never offer you anything in your interest (or it's just a scam attempt most of the times).   


Afaik skinbaron (which I personally use nowadays) and bitskins (I've used it before skinbaron) are trusted sites. Before you do ANYTHING trade/sell related please check this: [steam API key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). If there's any key registered, delete/remove them all.

This looks like a skin that you might find in a map collection, and I think it lacks the personality of most of the well-established skins that are around these days.

When making a skin, think about what color themes people might use them for, or if they would go well with other existing skins.

The main thing I think this skin needs is a personality, right now it's just a design (which is cool, don't get me wrong) but it needs something unique... some of the best skins in the game like the kill confirmed or the dragon lore have cool designs, but they have a central feature that the design revolves around and that gives it it's name.

That's the key to getting a featured skin, if that's what you are going for: good color themes, and a personality.

Some ideas: if you are going for a water/wave effect, maybe draw something in the middle that is making the waves. If your design is like the inside of a clam shell, with a pearly texture, maybe put a shell texture on the fringes of your skin. You could put something special, like words or a sea creature, on the clip or the body. Other nice skins with designs such as this have those defining features, like the aquamarine revenge. Just trying to give you things to think about."

When you hit your shortcut, or open the shadowplay menu and hit Save on the Instant Replay, that past 3 minutes is saved as a video. So its constantly recording and dumping out files in the GPU till you hit record, and it doesn't affect your fps much at all. There are some games that have an option to save recording for you, but I've never turned it on because on Xbox GTA V would record hundreds of short clips for barely any reason.

With your teams calls, you can change in settings what audio is recorded in the recording. On the pop up menu (using your shortcut keys), on the bottom right of the menu there is some icons like your mic and stuff where you can change what it listens to, you can let it record your voice or not, the audio from Discord or not, whatever you want it to hear though its not always perfect"

Some people to it to gamble with them (there is gambling sites where you bet with your skins). There are a collectors. There are investors buying skins because they think they will go up in value. People paying them because they look nice.

You can get skins two ways. One is thru drops, these skins are usually only worth cents. In these drops you can also get cases. These cases require a key. These keys are sold by valve and cost 2.35 dollars. They main thing you usually look for are knifes the chances of getting a knife is 0.0025% of a 2.35dollars purchase.

With this many hours you probably have bad habits that will only embed further if you only warm up and mm.
Personally I would try and forget everything that I know and develop a training schedule. Dont mm for a while. Break your training up into key fundamentals. 

An example of unlearning would be for aim. I woupd go into aimbotz and try 1 taps but dont go at your own pace. Go slow. Go as slow as you need to 1 tap say 500 bots without missing. Then increase your speed.

Watch pro games. I find that it sets a pace for tge game in my head.

Spend time in servers alone practicing utility.

Personally, I'm not very good at games and I'm getting old now but this year I started playing csgo. I've played 400 hours (300 or that probably training) and got to mg2. Not a crazy rank but as I said, I'm bad at games. So I vouch for training."

 A lot of player make big mistakes in these situations, like taking unecessary fights as a T after planting the bomb, or not being agressive enough during a retake, they will reach the edge of the bombsite and wont let go of the fucking shift key (THERE'S A BOMB DUDE) even after they give away their position, so the bomb ticks down to like 10s and the guy is still sitting in the same spot waiting for the Ts to pop out, so he and panics dies.
 LET GO OF SHIFT and start clearing angles, maybe click on the bomb to bait out a defuse and see if you can figure out where the Ts are hiding, you dont want to get on the bomb at 10s whit a living T, because he's just gonna wait for you to defuse  before peeking from an angle you cant possibly reach whit those 10s and then go back to the bomb."

The stars used to add to the coin progression are calculated by the ones you get to spend. So if don't complete all your missions each week, but earn all your spendable stars, you can get the diamond coin."

1,2020-12-13,u/slickpicklerick69,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/kc1v4j/tips_for_a_complete_beginner/gfmumb9/,"Heyo new player friend. Just play the game and figure out how much you like it. CSGO is a game that you can dedicate 1,000's of hours learning about the game and still not have it all figured out. 

1. Play DM's on active rotation to get a feel for map layouts before hopping straight into competitive 5 mans. 
2. Don't label yourself as a certain role on your team if you are solo queuing. (Ex. Entry fragger, awper, support player) 
3. Start with a small amount of maps selected when you play 5 mans to allow yourself to learn strats a little faster.
4. This game isn't cod or battlefield. Playing the objective and contributing to the overall team goal is what is most important. Don't let yourself get down in the dumps just because you aren't top frag.
5. Learn a few key smokes and flash bangs to assist your team. (Yprac's map guides on the steam workshop are an excellent place to start learning lineups.)
6. Play some community servers! There are so many fun things to do like surfing, bunny hopping, and kz that will help you improve the way you move in game.
7. HAVE FUN and take the game at your own pace. All of the tips I have put above are no where near mandatory. At the end of the day, CS will be what you make it. You can take it serious or just relax and have fun. After playing CS for almost 15 years now, I have found that there has to be a balance. If you aren't progressing your skills then the game can become very monotonous playing the same maps over and over.

Hope this helps some, I don't have all the answers by any means. If you want someone to play with, send me a DM and we can link up."

1,2020-12-26,u/1HP_Cait,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/kkph19/gaming_health_performance_ama_from_medical/gh3vgw3/,"Hey Spacious,  


I'm sorry to hear you've been dealing with this for so long. The shoulder is a pretty complex joint, and there's a lot that can go on to cause pain there. I'm not saying this to say ""I can't help you"", just to let you know that I'm going to answer as best I can, but I'll be limited because I can't do a full evaluation. I'm going to answer this with the assumption that it's your mouse shoulder that's hurting, since you mentioned changing sens, but let me know if that's not the case.  


First, the fact that strengthening exercises help you does suggest that stability, motor control, and coordination are playing some part in your injury. That doesn't help us narrow it down much--there's a lot that can cause those impairments--but it does give us an important data point about what helps you, specifically.   


Second, the fact that this pain only comes on while gaming is like a big red neon sign saying ""something about your setup isn't supporting you well"". Even with really solid stability and motor control, your muscles will fatigue over time. I know you've said you've tried quite a few postures, but the key things I'd suggest you look out for are  
1. Is your arm abducted out to the side, with a lot of space between your elbow and ribs?  
2. Is your shoulder elevated (shrugged up towards your ear) or depressed (usually happens when you have to slouch down to the height of your armrests)?  
3. Do you use your armrests regularly, or are you stabilizing your arm only with your muscles?  


Ideally, your forearm should be supported on your armrest, relatively close to your side, with your shoulders relaxed but not slouched down.  


Third, you mentioned trying dry needling. Dry needling is a pretty specific intervention for trigger point release, and while it can help with relieving a trigger point, it doesn't necessarily address the issue causing the trigger point in the first place. We tend to get trigger points when a muscle is overworked and the load or strain isn't distributed well across a number of muscle groups (which ties back to my original statement about stability, motor control, and coordination being involved).  


There's a statement in medicine that ""when you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras."" The ""horse"" in this case would be a muscular issue involving weakness or lack of endurance in some of the scapular and mid/upper back muscles; this would not be something any of us could diagnose/address for certain without an assessment. If you're up for giving another medical professional a try, we do assessments like that through our Patreon and would be more than happy to help you as best we can.  


Sorry for the novel here! You've clearly been dealing with this for a while, and I want to give you as much helpful information as I can without stepping over the boundaries of what I can state definitively without an evaluation."

2,2020-12-27,u/Homicidal-Pineapple,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/kl0owa/beginner_here_seeking_advice/gh7zjlp/,"First things first: focus primarily on raw mechanics in the beginning. This means: Main weapons (this guide does not cover AWP, as it is more situational, and i would encourage all players without any exceptions to learn how to play rifles to at least a Master Guardian level before grapping the AWP), spray patterns, movement and firing, common weapon knowledge, economy, Pre-aiming and pre-firing, map control vs. rushing, hitboxes and damage multipliers and basics of utility usage.

Main Weapons: 

Start out by learning AK-47 and M4A4 (i'd suggest this one, as it is my opinion that it is superior to A1), glock and USP-S. These are the weapons that win the game. The SMGs and snipers might win rounds but rifles win games! They are not in any way situational, and it is important to know how they work, which will be broken down a bit more further down. Youtube can also help a lot. Keywords for youtubing this subject could be: rifles, spray patterns, movement, strafing and counterstrafing. Worth noting in this subject: CTs default pistols (P2000 and USP-S) are 1 headshot kills, which the glock isn't (both only on enemy without helmet). AK-47 are 1 headshot kill as well, even helmeted. M4A4 and A1 are not. Always pick up an AK over an M4 at round end. always!

Spray Patterns:

All guns have spray patterns and spread. This is what inaccuracy is made of. Spread consists of two important factors: bullet inaccuracy and first bullet inaccuracy, but first you need to know the ""ranking"" of inaccuracy. Your accuracy increases when doing anything that is ***not*** being crouched and sitting still while firing one bullet at a time. Standing up: decreases accuracy ever so slightly, movement: decreases accuracy drastically on rifles and snipers, but less on SMGs and basically not on shotguns, jumping: fucks the aim of anything else than shotguns and MP9 and Mac-10, being on a latter: fucks aim on anything else than shotguns and revolver, etc. Spray pattern is a set pattern that the bullets after the first one goes in. These are always the same.... but. The but is spread. First bullet inaccuracy exists, which means that if you are far enough away from a subject, you are not guaranteed to land the shot, regardless of weapon and crouching. Example: you are not accurate enough with a rifle to consistently be able to shoot a guy in Dust2's A site when you are in pit if using a rifle, even if the crosshair is on him. All bullets have inaccuracy, meaning that even though the spray pattern is the same, where the bullets land will differ from spray to spray. Even taking this into consideration, learning (or just knowing in the beginning) the spray pattern will help tremendously.

Movement and firing:

Has been mentioned under spray pattern: running fucks your aim. stand still when you fire unless you are using shotguns, SMGs or a pistol that is not Deagle.

Common Weapon Knowledge:

1) M4 needs 2 headshots to kill, are more expensive than AK but shoots a bit faster.  
2) M4A1-s is silenced: no tracers through smokes to shoot at, shoots at the same rate as AK  
3) Glock is basically run'n'gun. USP-S you're better off standing still or crouching  
4) Spray patterns of any gun gets smaller when crouched than standing up

Economy:

Basically: buy when the team all have enough to buy rifles, kevlar and helmet. On CT: 4.100, on T: 3.700. Eco if you cant do that UNLESS you cant buy next round either due to loss bonus: then force.  
Round loss bonus build up over time: 1 lost round adds 400 to the next rounds bonus for loosing, maxing at 3.400, equating the win bonus before kill rewards. If first round of a half is lost, the loss bonus is 1.800 as the only exception.  
Weapons do not give the same kill reward: Rifles and P90: 300, SMGs except P90: 600, Shotguns: 900, snipers: less than rifles, i think it is 100, but i cant remember.  
MOST IMPORTANT: Syncronise your buy rounds, force rounds and eco rounds across the entire team, or you will constantly be at a disadvantage.

oh yeah: basically: CT side have a tougher time with economy as they have to buy kit (400), mollies are more expensive at 600 compared to Ts 400 and their rifle is worse and costs 400 more.

Pre-aim and Pre-fire:

Basically: aim in the head, and always where it is most likely that the next enemy is coming from. If you know an enemys position, you can start firing before you spot him to have an advantage of reaction time. the rest comes with experience and youtube.

Map-control vs Rushes:

Be syncronised across the team. Giving opponents 1v1 fights are disadvantageous, so peek with a teammate and dont go alone into fights unless you are flashing the opponent. Decide to either go to a site or get map control. Map control grants the knowledge of whether CTs push and the advantage of 2v1 fights if they do, and you are more able to know where you are safe, and where you need to clear corners. Rushes give the advantage of outnumbering CTs as they are only 3 max on a site, due to needing to cover 2 sites. Disadvantage of this is they can use utility and know where you come from, so if you consistently do this, you're in for a world of pain.

Damage multipliers and hitboxes:

A player is, when it comes to the amount of damage taken, divided into 4 regions: legs, stomach, rest of the torso and head. You take base damage of the weapon minus the distance drop off in damage and minus the kevlars effect on the weapon. Different weapons are absorbed at different rates. Most important to know: Legs do 75% of base damage, torso: 100%, stomach: 125% and head: 400%. this means that headshots are FAR BETTER than anything else, but also that it takes 5 shots to the chest to kill with an M4 but only 4 to the stomach, and the Deagle kills in two shots to the stomach but 3 to the chest. Aim for the head, also when you do not see the opponent. **If you are to only take away one thing from this, let it be: AIM AT HEAD HIGHT - ALWAYS! Not only when in fight.**

Basic utility:

Smokes block vision, mollies do AOE damage, flashes blind and nades do direct damage. Most important here: use flashes to peak, never to hold back. Use mollies to stop rushes and smokes to stop pushes (read: mollies when you think they'd run through a smoke anyway, but else: smokes). You are always at a major disadvantage when pushing smokes so for the most parts: dont. Or at least accompany it with a flash. 

Oh and mollies are more expensive for CTs and they need at least a kit or two every round.

So if you opened 1k cases, you should get 6.4 reds. Since you opened sth like 400 cases (rough estimate for 1000€ spent at 2.10-2.20€ key price), you should've gotten 2.56 reds.

One thing that really bugged me though was the way you were peeking and not counterstrafing.

When you peek someone, ideally you want to be already aimed pretty close to where they could be, and as soon as you have gone far enough around a wall to where you can see them, you quickly tap the movement key opposite to where you were moving to instantly stop and become accurate.

Learning how to isolate angles, preaim exactly where their head will be, and counterstrafe automatically will come with time and practice."

Cs is an old game, and therefore skillgap has become high. When that is said though I can give you some small tips that might give you an advantage if you master them.

You can't just go push, I know it is fun, but the cover in this game is so essentiel. Try and stay behind cover, and if you need info, perhaps do a jiggle peak (If you do not know what it is, just look it up, it is simple enough).

One thing very important as well is to stay as still as posible I can see you are doing it mostly, but just one click on one of the WASD buttons and you're pretty much garanteed to miss. If you peak and when you se the enemy press the opposite key to completely stop momentum. Forexample you can when peaking from the right press A to completely stand still and get a standing accuracy rather than walking.

When playing with peek something, try and preaim where they could be. Especially when  you know they are there you have to be ready to shoot. In the video there is a situation where you have info where the guy is, but you proceed to peak him without being scoped. I bet if you were scoped it would be an easy kill!

Perhaps another crosshair would also drastically improve your skills already. If you like the crosshair then it is great. Crosshair is more about the feeling. If you want a different one you can download crazh's crosshair generator and make your own!

It's clear that you're not bad at the game, best you can do is just focus on the small details, since it is the details that often give you a heads up in 1v1's. Also there is always time to improve aim, even for pro's. Aim is the most consitent thing when dealing in 1v1's. There is no point in having a good position if you can't hit your enemy. There is also tons of map, for improving aim.

Watching pro's play does also help on the large sceem of aspect. Try to mimic some of their gameplay. Im not talking about their highlights where they push B on dust\_2 alone and get an ace. But try to watch a full game of perhaps your favorite team.

Hope you know that I am not trying to roast you, your gameplay does not suggest you're shit out of luck, you got some decent skill, you just need the finesse as well.

Have a good day! Hope this helps!"

It’s the unpredictable pushes and aggressive positions that are so hard, they usually stay in very common spots like coffins or a long and but not well hidden."
13,2021-01-18,u/AverageSven,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/kzs5jl/facts/gjqvnhk/,"Ah, counter-strafing is when you move sideways and tap the opposite movement key (Ex: moving left then tapping the rightwards key) to stop suddenly, increasing your firing accuracy for a single moment.

You can do this repeatedly back and forth, timing your shots for the precise moment your player model is standing still and has perfect accuracy.

The whole advantage of this is to make your player model a moving and unpredictable target, making it difficult for your opponent to hit you reliably.

However, the better you get at the game the better you predict where to shoot based on many hours of experience against players who counter-strafe.

Playing against someone who doesn’t counter-strafe is confusing because you think they’re going to strafe slightly so you aim a little left or right of them and miss and die.

Of course, you won’t win a game not counter-strafing. You’ll just tilt your enemy until they start just shooting straight at you instead of shooting where they think you’ll be.

Another thing to consider is that when you’re standing behind a wall you can quickly counter strafe to get a shot off while barely exposing yourself for a short duration."

Eg, some p90 players would get one tapped a lot more on 128ticks, and scoped-walking with awp would be easier. However spraying and spray-transfer will be a lot easier to achieve and control on 128ticks."

3,2021-02-03,u/lBreadl,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/lbif9g/i_use_too_much_w_and_s/gluajql/,"I would recommend learning to counter strafe diagonal movement (if you are moving forward with W and right with D, counter it with S and A. Same premises with other diagonal movements.), it can be useful if you get caught off guard.








But you really want to limit diagonal movement, it's not necessary all the time, it's rarely necessary.










One example where you might use diagonal movement is on Overpass, the Connector Stairs leading down to Connector can be peeked diagonally when trying to clear the first corner. Even then, you don't need diagonal movement to peek it but it would create a faster peek if done correctly.











Most of the time, try to just use A and D, counter strafe accordingly.







One place you might find yourself moving diagonally, when it's not needed, is Long A on Dust 2 as CT. Let's say no one pushes you Long A (while you are at Long Corner) and you want to clear Double Doors, use W to bring yourself closer to the doors but only so far so that you can use D to clear inside doors while your back is against (close, but not touching) Blue Cargo. There are a few reasons why this is the optimal method to peek Double Doors: 








1. While coming closer, with W, you can easily keep your crosshair on the door and easily counter in case an enemy pops out. Crosshair placement and reaction time are key here.









2. If you use D correctly, you will be as far away from Double Doors as you can go (the closer you are to a corner, the easier it is for the enemy to see you first) and be able to quickly counter strafe if you see someone. You will be a much harder target to hit because of your speed and your distance from Double Doors.











3. By doing this, you can quickly peek outside long (specifically the car, where a lot of people wait for CT's to peek) and even throw in a jump if you think someone is at car waiting for you.












4. You are perfectly setup to enter Double Doors (after clearing inside, with your back against Blue Cargo), and should currently be behind the right door closest to CT Side. From this point you can move closer to the right door and quickly strafe to the left door, quickly checking for enemies, and quickly strafe inside with D. This can all be done in one swift motion.









Hope this all made sense, good luck"

I also have a supreme account I play with my self solo queuing and such.

I have fun on both accounts - its fun to watch crazy strats silvers try to do or they come up with thats already a strat but itsnt as polished as higher levels. Smoking and flash placement are key differences in most brackets. Aim gods are everywhere but other thought processes are lacking.

Also there is an option to buy brokenfang battle pass, do missions to earn stars and spend those stars to buy brokenfang cases. ( you could make some profit. in total you get 100 stars = 50 broken fang cases, each goes for +/- 0.6€) 

To unbox the case you need to have a key, it costs 2,20€. ( they are not marketable and tradeable ) each case contains different type of skins. Each skin has it's Exterior and unique float. The lower float number, the better it will look. 

It's pretty much gambling. You have 60% chance to get blue skin, which costs 0.09€. It's +/- 0,4% chance to get golden item. So if you feel lucky and have money to waste, then go for it, but if you want skins, just buy them from market or 3rd party sites with up to 40% discount, like : Skinbaron / skinport / bitskins / etc. Just don't get scammed, there are a lot of fake scam websites.

Before you open case, do research how much some skins in it cost. Like there are some cases where red skins cost a bit more than the key it self, so not worth it. Good example is Five Seven Angry Mob. I would suggest to use https://csgostash.com/ . It shows all cases and skins."

If you are consistently top of the board, you gain more elo for wins and lose less elo for losses.

If you really want to climb out, you'll want 3, 4, or 5 buddies around your rank to consistently queue with. That'll make it easier to coordinate as a team and not have to worry about bad teammates.

Other than that, it's a grind. I climbed out of Silver Master to DMG twice, on two separate accounts. The latter was entirely solo queues, and I was at DMG at 120 competitive wins (half of which were probably not part of the grind, but screwing around with friends)."

there should be enough information by now to build a profile of how specific cheats work,  and ban based on percentage match to behaviour and key aspects. stupid modes like spin bot are pretty rare imo, as you said these should just get auto ban. the most common is wallhack, followed by fake lag/antiaim imo. I think the prevalence of these greatly outweigh other cheat modes. aim bot or aim assistance is probably the most easy to hide if configured right. the temptation for players who have vision assistance not to act on the information is pretty hard, I think this catches a lot of new cheaters out, looking at players through walls, acting on information that couldn't be gathered through other players or from audio cues. makes overwatch easier for me lol."

I'm sur you can rank up a lot (if as you seem to say you have bad rank)

No more than 1 competitiv each day. Play more community server it will make you play against player with different lvl (some way better than some not that good)

Always warm up before playing competitiv with deathmatch(it will also help you improve your aim if you do it regularly)

If you have trouble aiming check if ur mouse sensibility is in the norm. And if you choose the good key for keyboard. 
Never tilt in game. Never flame. Try to keep economy. Cheer your teamate drop them. Don't speak about the mistake people make. Take lead in t side (don't get angry if they don't listen to you) 

Check if you are correctly installed in front of your screen and not to far. 

Watch video about crosshaire placement, perspectiv in cs go etc. Video of promatch too. 

Train your spray your counter straff too. 

With 5000hour and bad rank you should have pretty good aim against them so play like a star, let your teammate go before you. You'll get info on where ennemy are (it's baiting yes but it make you win game, i always bait for the best of my team) 

Play safe in counter terrorist give info rotate fast. 

And most importantly have fun it's just a gqme

And last time I checked, Russian students, around the 2nd - 5th grade, get english lessons. Why they don't focus on them? I have no idea. 

The way they mostly make 3-4 person lobbies is... evil. Did I mention how most of them kick you at the end? (No matter the score, no matter the kills)

All of the matches in this style end up in me basically being the only one giving info in english (Ironic, right? Like they'd understand) and listening to 30-90 minutes of blahblahdavaybly\*tblahblah.

I **yearn** for a single, simple ""*Oh, crikey! I forgot to check mid, mate. My apologies.*"" or a loud ""*Sweet home Alabama*"" or a ""*Aussie aussie aussie*"" or any other possible sign of veritable englishmen (from either of the native-english-speaking countries). Don't get me wrong, I'm okay with even the most shabby accent as long as it is still english at its core.

Ode to any russian that can read and understand this without a translator.  
I apologize if I offended you or anyone you love."

Funny story, I actually left cheat engine up while trying to play comp. I was playing and idle game beforehand, which is why I was using cheat engine (it's an applications that allows you to easily edit numbers i.e. easy to cheat in currency for singleplayer only games). Thank god cheat engine is super popular (and no one in their right mind would try to use cheatengine on csgo, that would lead to instant VAC ban). Basically, I got kicked from the comp match cause VAC no likey cheat engine, I had to reinstall my game cause of CE.







Cheat Engine was just accidently left open, had I actually tried hooking in to CSGO I would probably have been banned. Needless to say, I was shitting bricks because I thought I would lose my inventory. Bullet dodged."

When you lose a lot, 3-4 games in a row, just take a break, play something else. No need to lose further and end up deranking.

3000 hours in cs:go, depends, are these 3000 hours recent? Like, are you playing cs:go constantly or just casually with long breaks between hundreds of hours?

Yes, THERE ARE CHEATERS, but again, with 3000 hours you should know better than most of us that faceit is free and you can just go and play there. 

Also, the way you communicate it's the key in this game. If you lose and then hop on the next game with a negative attitude, even if you are in the right, the way you gonna talk with your teammates will sound toxic, which will ruin everyone's mood.

If your mouse software is insane and able to perfectly control recoil for every weapon (and I already know it can’t) then someone reviewing your demo for overwatch would likely mistake it for injectable cheats, and you could get banned.

Concerning your aim issues, try an aim trainer. Things to note when you do:

  
\- Take an [assessment](https://www.3daimtrainer.com/assessment/) of what your skills are at the moment. This is a good guideline to start out with.  
\- Train the courses you are weak at. If it's all or most of them, then train all or most of them daily.  
\- It's much more beneficial to have a daily routine/warmup of about 30mins instead of once a week for hours on end.

Being a good awper is not about being a one-trick, learning to awp is to learn the game AND the awp. Remember, you won't be able to afford the awp every round, so practice your one-taps and one-deags so you can kill and then afford the awp. Sure your teammates can drop you that awp, but your awp is first and foremost ***your responsibility***, especially in matchmaking.

So, the best way to learn how to use the long boys are just to learn how to shoot properly, one-tap practice helps a lot. Practice hitting the opposite key of your current movement and shooting at the right time (that split second when you're not moving while changing direction), practice only moving in one direction at a time when possible so you can counter that movement easier, practice good crosshair placement.

Learning the awp means learning the entirity of cs + more extra work, it's gonna take a while and requires patience and discipline. But it's a lot of fun once you master it, and that's the most important part of mastering the craft, to have fun.

TL;DR : Learn to shoot without the awp before learning to shoot with it.

P.S. The scout, it's just awping with extra steps."

even though the start of the FAQ gives some BS about TF being something that they don’t want people to worry about AND SO THEY DON’T TELL US HOW TO IMPROVE TRUST FACTOR. Regardless, people seem to have a good idea about what effects trust factor even though valve wont tell us.

If you scroll down the FAQ’s it becomes clear telling us not to worry about trust factor is BS because some of the key questions are “low trust is effecting my mm experience” and  “my friends low trust factor is ruining our matchmaking”. And even with my own anecdotal experience i’ve had my friends invite a teammate to my mm lobby, it says “mm experience may be effected as xyz has lower trust factor than yours”, which if you guessed correctly would result in us playing against cheaters/smurfs or being teamed with toxic griefers where I normally would not.

Dus de hoeveelheid geld is afhankelijk van de hoeveelheid cases die je wil openen.

Houd wel rekening met het feit dat je je cases aan deze gast geeft. Er zit geen verzekering op (als je hem niet persoonlijk/heel goed kent) dat hij je de cases/wat eruitkomt ook echt geeft. Kans is erg klein dat je wat leuks krijgt (laat me weten trouwens, ben wel benieuwd) maar sommige items gaan voor rete veel geld.

Go to practice with bots (choose medium ,hard or expert bots as per you) and choose any map of your choice. And play deathmatch

When you enter the game, open the console. Type this command: mp\_damage\_headshot\_only 1

This will make the bots immune to body damage. And it'll give you a lotta practice

Here are some tips to improve your aim:

1. Choose a good weapon and good maps for yourself. I like the sg553 and awp but you can use other rifles too. Don't play all maps. Practice on 3-4 maps and master them.
2. Analyze your spray patterns. In most cases, hold down the left click to spray and drag your mouse downwards as you do it. This is enough to kill upto 2 players at once.
3. Considering mouse settings, I usually don't go for 180 deg. in one sweep. I do like somewhere 90deg to 120deg in one sweep. You can adjust the settings to keep them low as well as comfortable according to you.
4. Considering peeking, make sure to have a good cover when peeking. Use 'A' and 'D' keys to peek at all times. If you feel that there's an enemy awp, don't go for it. In extreme cases, use a smoke or flash to nullify the awper. This won't get you killed.
5. Last but not the least, watch pro players play on [twitch.tv/esl\_csgo](https://twitch.tv/esl_csgo) . That'll give you pretty good idea of the game.

I just wanted to ask... how much playtime do you have? (check it on steam)

3,2021-03-20,u/WeirdoKunt,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/m8uzr7/playing_wingman_before_competitive/grjk04p/,"I always suggest getting workshop maps like aimbotz to practice mechanical aim and recoil. But also there are training maps of the official maps where you can practice peeks and grenades/smokes/flashes etc.

Practice is always key. Doing some mechanical work to get used to aiming/recoil and adding some tactical stuff using utility and peeks for certain maps. These things will give you a certain ""base"" in skills. Which will take far longer if you just play MM/wing. So getting this base built up will help you from getting super wrecked. You might still get wrecked but you will be better than a BOT at least.

So start doing the practices. Play comp and wingman as well but in between put a bit of time to just purely practice."

Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops."

I would say the ak is the best gun in the game as it is a 1shs at any range, and has a decently easy recoil pattern. Awp’s are a 1 ndone so if you can bait out a shot you generally will have a free kill. Flashing them is a good option and will usually lead to them taking a timing shot. Smokes are okay but not the best.... I wouldn’t recommend smokes unless you know lineups as they can create unfavorable one ways for the awper rather than let you push to them. If you know where ones is jiggle peeking/ air strafing to bait a shot out then molly them is a very good option as it will force them to move (wait 2 seconds to push after a molly lands as some players will yank the damage to try and pick you) in short utility is key in taking down an awper, just pick your poison carefully and learn a few simple lineups. Look to nothings nades for noobs series or someone like nadeking I believe has a lot of videos on this as well. On top of that just generally get good at counter strafing as you can jiggle and take a few pop shots at the awper and use peekers advantage to your advantage."

Some proplayers dont have any skins in their inventory, so they will face hackers in MM if they play? If I´m poor and cant afford an impressive inventory, I´m doomed to be in low trustfactor?  


What if I have rare skin patterns worth a lot but the market price isnt high in general? What if the market shifts the value of an item in my inventory? Will my trustfactor be negatively affected if the value drops? Some items are too expensive for the steammarket, so my inventory would be valued at 0? There is way too many grey areas here for them to be making anything conclusive.  


The only way this could work to their favor, is by using data from the account buying in-game items, such as keys, capsules, music kits etc. However, this wouldn´t be flawless as they would just be able to sell these items again.  


It is way more reliable for them to look at hours played, mm games, times being reported in these games, times being kicked from games and times the player has left a game."

Is there a chance you need to clean your keyboard? You can look up how to do that safely.

Maybe a driver / hardware issue?

That will be my first upgrade, then probably in a couple months I will get a new mouse (currently have an equally old Razer Death Adder), and finally I will upgrade Motherboard, CPU, and RAM all at once.

Lets begin!

# TRAINING MAPS:

All of the best community made (practice) maps are now on Steam Workshop, and you’ll need a few to get yourself going.

**Numero Uno:**

Download the CSGO Hub training map, [**HERE**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2185699891)**.**

It’s a good place to start.

Mow down a few hundred bots in rush mode (minimum 4 bots, then once that’s easy go up to 5, and so on). Run-and-gun in the obstacle course with various weapons to get used to aim-tracking and practice pre-aim on the competitive map runs. This map also has a ton of crosshairs to choose from (since the default is terrible).

Speaking of crosshairs, here's mine: CSGO-pZJ3f-FP6qu-jyTxu-i9nLx-AUc3K

It dynamically adjusts, slightly, only to remind you that you need to apply spray control and to slow down your fire-rate when shooting over distance. It's all personal choice, again. Choose from a few and see which works for you.

**Dos, Tres... Veinte:**

Someone named Ulletical made a fantastic slaughter-house called, 'Aim\_Botz'. You can download it from, [**HERE**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660).

This is very good for laying waste to endless hordes of bots (generally, you should go for headshots only) using a variety of weapons. As previously mentioned, Ulletical made this map, but he also makes a bunch of others. The most notable of which is his, ‘Recoil Master’ map - so you can practice beating the spray of each rifle.

You can find all of Ulletical's maps, [**HERE**](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=330128769).

Grab each of the Yprac maps; there is one for each competitive map. They all have their own individual pre-aim assault course, grenade lineup practice, etc. There’s also the Yprac, 'Aim Arena'; which is similar to the Ulletical Recoil\_Master map.

You can find all of Yprac maps, [**HERE**](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=740795413).

It's horses for courses, but you can’t go wrong with either map creator.

# TRAINING CONFIG FILE:

Download a training config and modify it to suit to your own needs - Here is mine: [https://pastebin.com/auz8L0UN](https://pastebin.com/auz8L0UN)

Create a *Practice\_Config.cfg* file in your *...\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\\csgo\\cfg* folder and paste in that PasteBin data. 

Please have a look through the config and familiarize yourself with the commands and the overall syntax used. I'd highly recommend looking at the binding of keys. You can change your key binds until your heart is content, but I'd highly recommend, as a minimum, using individual binds for grenades and also a no-clip bind for ""practice mode"" (this also applies to the practice maps).

When you start up your own CS Server (with bots), just go into Console and type:

*exec practice\_config*

The console will suggest an autocomplete, then just use the arrow buttons. Once you've hit Enter, the round will restart.

# THE MOST SENSITIVE SUBJECT OF THEM ALL:

This is a touchy subject here in the CSGO community: ***sensitivity***.

It’s all personal preference, but I’d recommend you keep your eDPI (Effective Dots Per Inch) at 1200 or below. Anything above that and you’ll be able to move your crosshair erratically with only your wrist.

eDPI is simply: Counts Per Inch \* In-Game Sensitivity.

Obviously, eDPI depends on your setup. If you only have a small mouse mat then you’ll need a high mouse DPI for your desktop and the same in-game. I used to run 1600CPI on my mouse, but I also had a shorter (cheap) gaming pad. Now I have an MM300 Medium (360x300mm) and can get away with lower CPI &amp; in-game sensitivity settings.

I currently use 800CPI (counts-per-inch) on my mouse and 1 sensitivity in-game - This equates to 800eDPI. I don’t think I can do a 180 spin from the centre of my mousemat, but if an enemy is behind you, you’re going to be more or less dead, regardless. If I was to ever become an AWPer I’d up my sensitivity to 800DPI + 1.5 sensitivity, in order to increase the speed of my “flick” with the scope.

As previously mentioned, I used to run 1600CPI (on an old MX Master) and in-game I’d have 2.x sensitivity. After lowering my sensitivity (to 0.625) my aim improved dramatically.

It can be very tempting to run circa-3000eDPI, because it feels seriously responsive, but I’d advise against it. Unless your mouse mat is the size of a coaster, of course.

# STEAM SECURITY AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO CONSIDER:

If you haven’t already done so:

1. Buy CSGO Prime - This will reduce your chances of encountering hackers and smurfs by a significant margin.
2. Add your mobile phone number to Steam - The benefit of this is two-fold. A) It increases the level of security and recovery offered for your Steam account and B) it doubles down by boosting your Trust Factor for Valve’s matchmaking system in CSGO.
3. Enable Steam Guard on your account; and download Steam onto your mobile phone. Remember: ***2FA in this day and age is important!***
4. Go into console and type: cl\_autowepswitch 0 - This will save you from being murdered. You'll thank me later.

# IN CONCLUSION:

I honestly don’t think the skill ceiling in CS has ever been higher. Even those in Silver can be leagues above their own individual skill level; excluding the hordes of Smurfs and hackers. It’s gonna be a long, winding, **Road to Global**, for all of us.

Welcome back, son.

Good luck and have fun."

But i imagine non english speaking players like Russians or anywhere else would also like to play with people who speak their own language because like i said, communication is key.

Like I’ll see people that are just pretty solid players then I’ll see someone who looks like they’ve never touched a mouse and keyboard before. This is common in a lot of games which is the problem. A massive group of people are all grouped into silver because it’s the lowest. Some of those people should actually be silvers and some should be way below silver if that was a thing. Although I don’t really know why EU and NA have this difference. There’s definitely a pretty obvious reason but idk.
1,2021-04-19,u/MrBananaStorm,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/mt35gp/why_did_they_not_do_it_yet/gv284hq/,"Here's my personal guide to global: I personally rarely got teammates that would communicate in English or at all even and often the English speaking ones would just be toxic. Here's the key, learn the behaviour of players in matchmaking. Every rank has their thing, but obviously the higher the rank the harder it is to take advantage of it. Big example that regularly works about MG2 to LE, imagine a post plant 1v1 or 1v2 on A site Mirage. You are the T on site. If there is a CT in the Jungle or connector area, it is practically a guarantee they'll go stairs and you can just wait for them to pop their head up.

In my experience and opinion that is the best way to get through matchmaking, become a one man army and play smart individually. That way you aren't going to be kept back as much by toxic or non-English speaking teammates. I know it often sucks, and it sucks to say this but honestly in my opinion that is your best bet, or you're gonna have to play with friends or play faceit."

You might already be aware that cfg files do not like control characters, so manually pasting them in seems to be the only way for it to work, but turns out the yellow modifier (tab) works just fine. You can set binds to radio chat commands being yellow. Something I discovered recently.  


You also can't do more than one word in the text accompanying the text because of quotation restrictions in cfg files.

Back when i was learning my job, we had cs 1.6 on the work pcs. We were 4 people learning there, so whenever the boss went away, we would play a 2v2 on dust 2.


Just one of us 4 was a pc gamer and the other 2 never played any fps game, while i played some shooters on ps3/4. So one friend was very good in the game and showed us some tricks and the other 2 were as bad as me, in pc gaming, but they also weren‘t as experienced in fps games as i am. So every in every game it was my pc gamer friend with one of the others, against me and the other one and it was so fun.

In class we had 2 other friends which also played on pc and they always told me to get cs, so we can play together. At some point i got csgo and play a few games with the friend from work, but not any ranked games, just some demolition.

Then later the 2 other friends wanted to play normal ranked games together, but i was still so bad. But well all 3 of my friends had to take smurf accounts to play with me and they don‘t really care for low ranks like gold.

I played with them every now and then and we had fun, but basically i was just getting carried by my friends till gold. At first we played together frequently, but later when we finished our school, i didn‘t really had any contact with them anymore. So now i still got on my pc like once per month to play some demolition games in cs to have fun. But i never played ranked again since i would make my team lose and it wouldn‘t be fun.

It‘s nice how mostly bad players play demolition, so it‘s fun, but sometimes there is one player who knows a bit about this game on one team and it‘s just a massacre


And i remember a game on safehouse where an enemy was using wallhacks. It was so obvious for everyone who watched him and my team always wanted the other team to kick him, but they didn‘t. So at some point one of my teammates said fuck it and used his wallhacks too. The rest of the game was just those 2 players killing everyone thru the walls and then a 1v1 between 2 players with wallhacks.


But basically demolition is good enough for bad players to have fun and if you really want to play competitive games, you should get 1-3 teammates who play too and be experienced in the game. 

So basically if you are new and aren‘t really experienced in the game, you could just play some demolition to have fun and get used to playing this game, befor you play ranked."

Take it from a guy that managed to get an ace with just the Tec-9 on a Acer laptop that runs Minecraft at barely 30 fps with the minimum render distance.

1,2021-04-27,u/jiklogen,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/mz6ve1/need_help/gw0z5j2/,"The shaky bhop as you call it is usually used for long jumps. There is usually an LJ room in kz maps so I'd recommend practicing strafes there. To practice bhop in general, I'd say go to bhop maps as they focus more on mouse-keyboard accuracy rather than hitting your scroll right.

From my experience jumps with proper strafes come from practice as your mouse and keyboard movement get more in sync. You don't need 9 strafes per jump but knowing how to strafe properly is really useful.There is usually accuracy% in the chat or hud, so pay attention to it as you add more strafes to your jumps.

Mousewheel is all you need to bhop. It's not as useful in comp as knowing how to move in general. Kz will teach you how to prestrafe, longjump, surf, how to work around ladders (valve pls fix) and how to bhop. All of these are useful in mm."

i was playing against some people who were using only bunnyhop hack too and it was fun game :D
it were nice people tho and bunnyhopping doesnt give you that much of an advantage.. 
fast for rotates but if you fuck up and hop into enemy youre dead real quick regardless.
so it was a fun game of them hopping like crazy to make insane fast rush that worked sometimes, othertimes they failed so hard it was hilarious because they where still midair when we were peeking them and picked them off.
i didnt even report them but after a day or 2 they got vac banned.
dont even remember if their team or mine team won i just remember having a good time.

as a legit bhopper myself who dies so often hoppy around a corner not expecting a lerk player there and dying due to hopping, it was refreshing to play bhop knife fight  in mm at d2. the bhop cheater wouldn’t shoot me when they saw me hopping and we tried to knife us then :D"

On the other hand, players with medium-low hours but high skill (veterans from other games, or people who get their first account stolen and banned by russians who use fake steam sites and abuse the API key) will never be able to find a game against legits.

What valve needs to do is not spend time implementing a band-aid system, but to actually do their job and fix OW/VAC, and better identify blatant purchased/throwaway cheater accounts. Coincidentally, doing this will get rid of most of the low-hours-high-rank accounts from high trust, while making sure that legit players aren't affected."

If they're an abuseable mechanic by your team it removes a range of tactics, as for the mute I have all my teams perma muted while in silver, until about sem. 


And that what angers me the most, players have been reporting the same problem for years and valve still doesnt have a fix or solution for it. 


Same with the +left in console to not have to play the match to avoid being banned, its such an easy command and valve should have a system to detect when someone uses console commands to go afk.


And when they removed jump scouting it took a large chunk of tactics out of the game, why bother using a scout now? The scope goes shakey when you walk and has a slightly higher recovery time.


Another big problem is the $2k negev and the useless m249, every other round Im in theres 1 person that uses the negev exclusively. Now its part of the game and they're just winning their way, but atleast reincrease the price to like $4k, the negev is a 2nd round gun now. And its literally impossible to peak a corner when someone has a laser beam of bullets flying around it. Yes you can wait for the reload but most people prefire and peak the corner with the negev.


I think my biggest frustration is that I used to love css, and csgo but dont really want to leave the game permanently but it seems that the game isnt going to be fixxed anytime soon and the player base is just getting more toxic by the day.


And thanks I'll check out valorant, it probably has a better playerbase and the devs probably actually care about gameplay and mechanics."

Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries!

You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.

Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK.

Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.

Before Reddit starts making fun of me, lemme ask you a question. If a case had 50% chance of dropping a knife, are you sure you'll get a key every 2 crates. 

The answer is - _you can open any number of cases, but you'll never be guaranteed to get a knife._

The actual solution probably goes somewhat this way. 

Let's say I wanna open *n* cases.

What's the probability none of them have a knife. 

As the probability of it not being a knife for each case is 99.74% or 0.9974

Let's think we want at least _one_ knife in the cases we open so the probability of that happening is

1-(0.9974^n)

After running some numbers, I found out that, you have a 99.91% probability of getting at least one knife when you open _2700_ cases. 

Bad choice IMO.

That is 1.4 ms of difference due to the hz of the monitor. 

Now that that is established, the equivalence (or more) of that delay is any of the following : the ping on lan servers, the delay on any mouse/ keyboard or even the delay of your computer sending signals to the server. 

In conclusion: no they are not winning because of their monitors and even if they were what would the issue be? They spent the money for 1.4 ms faster and it’s not like other orgs can’t afford £500 monitors."

\- learn to shoot without moving (aim bots or csgohub. Face a bot, very close to him. Strafe and kill a bot behind him without killing the one near you. The shot will only be accurate if you counterstrafe)

\- muscular memory: Your aim is as precise as your sensitivity is low. This is probably very easy to grasp. Does that mean your e-DPI should be nikos (600dpi)? No. There is a in between ""i can shoot precisely"" and ""i can move without smashing my mouse into everything"". If you have a good mouse and a reasonable mousepad (or some space) consider lowering your DPI to something between 1000-1500 e-DPI (mouseDPI\*csgo console sensitivity number). Then you got to train in aimbots/csgohub to make ur muscles get used to your new sensitivity. 500 kills per day for 7 days should make it.

\- Learn the angles and aim positioning: silver usually walk around the map with the aim too low. With time, you'll learn the right height of enemies head considering uneven terrain. The best way to learn this and where to put your aim is downloading community map ""yprac"" for any map you like the most and enter ""preaim/prefire training""

\- Surf: there is a community map called  Surf Map - How2Surf / How to Surf by vizoomer. This will eventually help with mouse/keyboard coordination

\-deathmatch: play one everyday. The thing is: this will improve your basics, but you got to train right. Every seasoned player will tell you that is very hard to break old habits, so you got to train from the beggining the right way. What is the right way? SHOOT HEADS. Focus on HS only. Not only one tapping, or bursting. Spraying as well. The objetive is, kill as many as you can, don't aim for the body. If you aim for the body, you're doing it wrong. Don't play other modes, like guns race, because using multiple weapons will make your aim never get used to the thing you should be doing.

Last thing: don't focus on grenades now. When you get to gold 1-2, these will be necessary, but first you need to learn the basics. Grenades will be one of the greatest assets in your arsenal, but only if used right. The thing with grenades is: you gotta watch youtube videos. And this is not for everyone. Plus, youtube videos will show you 20 grenades, but you won't memorise any if you don't practice. So, go to youtube, learn how to make a .cfg file for offline grenade throwing, practice ONE smoke and ONE flash until you understood it perfectly, use it in game. Once you can use it consistently, train another smoke, another flash, use it in game.

Try release the W key as soon as you jump, if you want to land on the left, hold A while looking left with your mouse. This way you will actually turn mid air while jumping instead of travelling in a straight line like you did. 

It may seem trivial but it is very important in certain situation. For example if you get a good spawn as CT and you want to quickly get into a deep positing at short, there are certain jumps you need to make to save you split seconds.

Frankly I don't see why you should be able to primary-fire while simultaneously holding the secondary-fire button. That makes no sense. 

You said you're new to the game, so I'm wondering, are you used to right click being aim-down-sight, as it is in most other gun games? If so, I found myself in the same predicament while first starting, so I changed right click to crouch (which is essentially ADS in CSGO). Then I have secondary-fire/scope on mousewheelUP. Im sure that might seem crazy to most, but its worked just fine for me for almost 2k hours.

4,2021-05-29,u/silvertrash101,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/nnrb1w/casual/gzw348m/,"Take it day by day and aim train/spray train and you will drastically improve. Do movement/util training/prefire maps day by day and you will drastically improve. Once you get some mastery of basics you can start to have fun and dish out punishment - and this does not require quitting your job, just a half an hour a day of consistent training. You gotta put in some time.

That being said, the game is positively fuck ridden with cheaters right now. It is far more atrocious than any of time period of this entire franchise. 

I downloaded walls (on a Smurf) for the fun of it. I'd say about 95% of games I had people looking at me through large chunks of the map. Ranked high silvers with upwards of 300 hours no less, sometimes 5 stacks of them constantly staring at me though walls. With trust factor on. 

Some other red flags without your own walls: They fucking suck until they get an awp - they only one tap - they don't know how to spray - one or two players play like they always know where you are - they wide swing around every fucking corner like an animal and somehow manage to still prefire you without lineups

Once you do actually have 2000 hours in the game, cheating becomes extremely fucking apparent, even subtle shit  

In lieu of this you have three choices: 

Either play long enough until your trust factor is so high that you only get a cheater 1 out of 10 games, or just a few closet cheaters that will still let you win. Id say this mark is around 1000 hours of trust factor competitive

Or 

Wait for the port to source 2. I am sure valve is going to clean up their shit with the port, because I am sure they're going to sell licenses for some rediculous price. (Even though most fans bought the game when it was still $20) The reboot will bring them so much money in fact that I'm sure the anticheat will be close to perfect - instead of the ""wave"" banning bullshit that is currently happening 

Or 

Try faceit. They actually give a singular dick about if people are cheating or not, so you can play in a competitive setting where you're not getting demolished by 3 years olds that only know how to use the w key and preline up headshots through walls and click when you move over their crosshairs - people actually take the game semi seriously here, so you will have to do that training I mentioned earlier 

As of now, valve will continue to solely release community made skins and community made maps and put a giant red stamp on it that says ""here's your content that we put so much work into""

We converted the batch file to .exe and disguised it as some random program. Worked great for about 2 years &amp; was still there at graduation. 

Fast forward a couple years after high school, and I run into an old IT guy that worked there, we get to talking and find out that not only did they know about it, but the random players we would encounter in LAN games were them!

this way you can bind both the nade and the ""stretched"" crosshair properties to your desired keys. Alternatively, you can use `exec filename` to load an entire config file containing your crosshair, which is what I do. So for example, you'd have something like this:

`bind ""x"" ""use weapon_smokegrenade; exec xhair_helplines""`

Obviously you should also add a key to revert back to your normal crosshair, or bind that to your weapon select keys, so you don't get stuck on the stretched one."

**Pre Recording:**

I've setup a dedicated server with **u/Splewis [Practicemode](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-practice-mode)** which I use to find and then rethrow utility. I usually spend a few hours finding the lineup and perfecting it with a main goal of making them as easy as possible(with varying degrees of succes). When I've found a nade and lineup I like, I then boot up CS through **[Half Life Advanced Effects(HLAE)](https://www.advancedfx.org/download/)** which enables me to do a lot of fun stuff like changing skins through **[nSkinz](https://github.com/namazso/nSkinz)** and using **[Reshade](https://reshade.me/)** which I currently only use for the greenscreen/chromakey effect. I use **[OBS](https://obsproject.com/)** to record and the key overlay is **[NohBoard](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/nohboard.44/)** with a badly made custom preset.

I use Adobe Premiere to ""build"" the main structure of the video and adding music, sound effects and finally color grading.
All effects, zooms, 3D tracking etc. are done in After Effects. 

**The Intro**

In this video it's just me noclipping(*I'm working on ~~using~~ understanding campaths for the next video*) to my character which is setup to not show the viewmodel so I can add that in later. I've then used speedramping in After Effects to get the slowmo/speed up feel.

 
**The Lineup**

The lineup roughly consists of 5 layers:

**1.** Main recording of the lineup and throw without the viewmodel.

**2.** Recording of only the viewmodel using Reshade's greenscreen/chromakey effect.

**3.** The main recording without the viewmodel but with a really low FOV to get a cleaner zoom(*in my previous videos I used to just zoom in on the first recording, but while being way easier and faster, it was too blurry*).

**4.** Key overlay(NohBoard). 

**5.** 3d tracking the text and lines to walls on both the main*(even though you only see it for like half a second)* and zoom 
recording.

**The Throw**

The throw is me noclipping(*again campaths coming soon*(*hopefully*)) in slowmotion(*""host_timescale 0.1""*) then add shake, blur and all kinds of stuff in After Effects.

**The Outro**

From the part where the smoke hits the roof I've used ""*spec_pos*"" to get a start and end position and then using ""*spec_lerpto*"" to fly between them. I usually make a bind that should look something like this: 

""*spec_goto* **[first position]**; *spec_lerpto* **[second position]** *8 8*(time in seconds)"" 

The last part is hard to explain, but a lot of 3d tracking, masking, layering and trial and error.

You haven't defended shit. You've been name calling, rude, and overall fucking scummy. And you seem to think you are allowed to act like that because you CHOSE to be offended instead of giving a thoughtful response or counterpoint.

You reacted emotionally and instead of thinking: ""this isn't how I would like my nation to be thought about, I should act as a mature representative of my nation and win hearts and minds with a thoughtful response. That isn't full of vitriol"". 

You did the: ""OMG this is SO offensive. Why should I speak the most common language of a game that I chose to play."" And ""you're *jealous* that we leave battles before we lose them"" and ""are you fucking retarded"" and ""fuck off you little twat"" and ""what's your rank BRO?!""

Imagine how many people could walk away from this thread thinking the French were pretty cool people if you laughed at the joke, said something like ""this is funny, but a bit dated.

In this comment I will try to help you guys so you don't get scammed

###STEP 1

• Make sure you don't have an API key created, scammers got you then, but **IT'S STILL NOT LATE**. I'm going to tell you how to revoke an Steam API key:

1. Go to the following link:
https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey

2. If you have an API key created, random numbers and letters will appear in the content box. Make sure to revoke it pressing the button below it.

###STEP 2

• You may not have an API key, but **maybe someone is logged into your account**. If you're in doubt, you should deauthorize all devices logged into your account in the link below.

https://store.steampowered.com/twofactor/manage


###STEP 3

• There's still one thing to check, **scan for malware**, you may got infected by some virus which will scam you if you don't take action (I got scammed by that 1 year ago when ""creating"" a Steam level up bot).

If you don't know which antivirus to use, I recommend malwarebytes:

https://www.malwarebytes.com/


###The following steps aren't necesary at all, but I still recommend following them if you think your account got compromised

- Change your Steam Trade URL
- Change your Steam Password (You already deauthorized devices but I still recommend it)

Good scams these days, lucky I was able to figure it out before I lost my inventory (damn near 800$ at the time)"

It doesn't matter if you can study or not, you'll have to sacrifice something to sign with an org.

Signing with an org almost certainly mean a full time job, with extra commitment to keep up with other players outside of your working hours.

I sacrificed many things and now I serve cappuccino for a living... Not to sound salty about failing to go pro, but please don't take the choice lightly.

I don't regret it, but understand that at the very least it's going to waste a couple years of your youth to gamble on an uncertain career, and if you're not ready to give that much you'll have practically zero chance of going pro unless you can easily do 1v5 clutches against faceit lvl10 consistently.

Play with your friends regularly and learn to understand each other. Giving out accurate information about what you see and hear will help to make good decisions about when to rotate. Seeing one player at a site doesn't mean the rest of them are there too. 

Cosshair placement:
Having your crosshair at the right position helps a lot when hitting shots. Aiming at the ground doesn't help. It should always be at head height. Turn a corner expecting someone to be there holding the angle. There's a good workshop map series by Yprac. Train on the preaim mode. This helps to show you where to expect players and build that preaim mechanic. 

Map knowledge:
It all comes with time, but anticipating your opponents is key. Knowing where they could be and what their options are, and the quickest route to get there is important.

Hope this helps!"

&gt;Level playing field is a concept about fairness, not that each player has an equal chance to succeed, but that they all play by the same set of rules.

No one said smurfs aren't bad, but are they worse than cheaters? No. Everything you said about unfairness can be applied to cheaters as well. Instead of a person with a master's in QM taking the same test as you, it's a guy who has access to the answer key on Google.

At least if you get destroyed by a smurf, you can get frustrated, but also inspired because some day with enough practice, you can get that good. You can even learn some tactics from them while facing them. You may not pick it up right away, but at least you know what you can work on. Not as hard as quantum mechanics, believe me.

When you face cheaters, it's just bad all around. You know that you literally cannot be as good as a blatant cheater no matter what and you'll only face more and more cheaters as you increase your rank as opposed to less and less smurfs. It drives you to quit the game."

As we say in California, I'll bet you couldn't pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won't go away. A zit on the butt of society. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you. I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid.

I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh. Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.

But we sometimes forget that there are ""challenged"" persons in this world who find these things more difficult. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you. You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you.

And you wont achieve true consistency because we aren't robots. It's just not possible to be always good. 

1. Don't assume your mental state is your only problem. Always try to improve further, like basic techniques, counter strafing and so on. 

2. On the other hand, you should try to keep yourself and your team motivated. Send some good vibes, tell yourself and your team how good you are. Sometimes it really helps to say to yourself ""I'm the best on the server"" but don't think you're the very best. You can be better than someone else and have weaknesses nevertheless. I'm really sure you can improve a lot besides the mental weakness.

3. Like WarOwl would say: Give yourself the permission to failure! With this attitude you can work on your consitency. Try to identify your behavior and categorize your games into A, B (the Average), C. Then try to identify your current state in the game and adapt to it. When you play a round on dust2 and you realize that you play your A game, then go risky, make moves, bring the team forward. When you have a C game, play safe, give team info, throw some util, don't go for risky 1v1. Trust me, we all have those silver days but  the key is to adapt. Dont try to prove yourself that you can hit a specific shot or definitly are able to win a fight because you did it in the past - this wouldn't work in a C game. 

Conclusion: You can always improve, even in solo q. But teamwork is maybe the most important skill in csgo. Maybe you will be more tilt resistent when you play with friends, because you can't hate some randoms. When you say that Solo q is no fun anymore, you should definitly play with others. I don't know if a fixed semi-professional team is necessary in order to improve to be honest."

API scam. 

The scammer obtained your login credential long enough to set an API key address in your account. 

They social engineer you in chat to get you to make a trade to a friend or a trading site bot. 

They cancel the trade you intended and instantly create a new trade to an account that looks identical to the one you were trying to send the skin(s) to. 

you think it's safe so you authorize the trade on your steam app. 

boom. your skins are gone.

second way: 

They get ahold of your icloud password via social engineering or database hack

they clone your phone from your latest backup in the cloud and then they have your steam app and can authorize trades as if they had your phone and password. 

how to prevent: 

turn off icloud backups in your icloud settings and backup on a local machine instead. 

Use a strong iCloud Password (duh)"

Just because it is a widespread phenomenon that is widely accepted by high rank players does not make it morally okay. It ruins the game for new players like OP, who undoubtedly experienced smurfs to not have ranked up in such a long time. Smurfing so you can play with friends is also not okay, just play unranked. There is exactly zero reasons to have an alt account for CSGO.

A matchmaking system is designed to pit you against opponents of similar skill levels, when that doesn't happen because of a smurf, no one wins

I've heard before that the team that gets dumpstered should try to learn from smurfs and try to better their own game based on the play style of the smurf. This is horseshit. Smurfs typically make plays where they fully rely on superior mechanical skill to bail them out of conventionally bad positioning, (i.e. running down mid alone without supportive flashes as a CT, something they would never do in their own rank) typically the only thing to learn from smurfs is ""have better aim"" which has no value.

The team that loses learns little, gets demoralised and wastes half an hour of time they should be spending having fun and learning to get better

The team that wins gets unearned elo, boosted to ranks they don't deserve, and ruin subsequent games for people in higher ranks.

The smurf ruins 9 player's games, learns nothing, arguably gets worse as a player, and is incentivised to continue smurfing by the success they have and the subsequent rush of dopamine their monkey brain has been starved of in their own rank.

Say it with me now,

Smurfing is cheating."

I'd also recommend some launch options for csgo. (right click in library -&gt; properties -&gt; launch options at bottom)  


I use:  
\+fps\_max 0 -nojoy -high -fullscreen +mat\_disable\_fancy\_blending 1 +cl\_forcepreload 1 -limitvsconst -forcenovsync +r\_dynamic 0 -refresh 144 -d3d9ex -tickrate 128 -trusted

Of course change like refresh 144 to 60 if you dont have a 144hz monitor. The rest of the launch options are pretty much just making the game as smooth as possible, better mouse/keyboard input times, smoother play and getting rid of the long launch csgo has."

There are plenty of things we can offer you as advice. Literally we can write you an whole essay about it. The most important thing is, that YOU find your blockade.

It seems that your aim/mechanics are on the way up constantly with your aim routine.So i would recommend to learn more about gamesense and positioning. Look your own demos and watch how to improve the situations you maybe lost or failed due to desicionsmaking. You maybe know the YT content of mahone\_tv or Elmapuddy, there are plenty of coaches and content creators who could help you in your situations. Watch Progamers/analysts Content and you will get severel new plays and impactful things in CSGO.The most important thing as an Esports gamer is: Develope a winners mentality!

Here are some interesting Videos about mindset and gamesense:

[10 Tricks To Improve Gamesense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcm9soxV0CM)[How to Improve Your Gaming Skills FASTER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKDja-6YKMg)[The Power of Mindset in Esports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MYWVLtFdyk)[The Power of Goal Setting in eSports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFXzwm1aqjM)

I create German CSGO educational content by myself on YT, but i guess there will be a little language barrier!

I wish you the best, it seems like you are eager to learn. Now you need to find the key for the next door!"

i tried to sell my inv and loged in through my pc, everything's fine and i went to sleep cause it was late, after i waked up, i wanted to know if anything changed, i took my phone and googled the website
skinbaron - (normal url : www.skinbaron.de - fake url: www.skin-baron.de) as i waked up i didn't thought at all and clicked and logged in... nothing happen after login on the website? after half  a minute i got an email my password and email were changed.

definitely my fault - but it was a happy ending for god sake - i wrote skinbaron support that they should freeze my acc with 2 skin worth of 1000€ so... ye^^ 15 minutes after this scam the fake website can't be found through google anymore and url can't be reached - i think its a common thing to prevent from getting caught

First off it's actually two flicks, the first when he turns the corner to mid and flicks through the wall, second after he kills the player and flicks 180. Secondly, it's not hard to see an unnatural movement that puts his crosshair on a player through a wall, the movement is sudden and incredibly smooth unlike the rest of his movement. It may have been an accidental press of a aim lock key since the rest of the game his aim isn't great and he's just using walls

Laughably, I assumed the edit on your post was to say you watched the whole video and take back what you said. I would love an explanation of why he changes directions on CT as soon as it becomes clear which way the terrorists are going, why he prefires corners only twice each time there is a player, why he uses a molotov to clear scaffold only once when there's a player there, why he and his teammate check obscure angles (boost at mid, back of CT) only when there's a player there, why he chases T with his knife out and no shift up until he is looking in the direction of the T who's waiting, why he only throws nades or utility at players positions despite not seeing them. Basically he changes his strat every round and it's always in a way that would counter the other team, that's not a sign of a good consistent player, it's a sign of person who knows where the other players are."

3,2021-09-19,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/pqlda1/nostalgia_ruined/hdexrh1/,"What's occuring is simply, the amount of hackers in the game that do pay $, valve doesn't want to ban the hackers in general terms. If hackers are making up for 60-70% of players in cs, banning would mean loss of revenue. Hackers currently still spend thousands of dollars on cases, keys &amp; etc. And, to lose out on that, means they'll lose out quite dearly. This also means a hard ban on players like an IP ban would cut the player base by 60-70%. This would mean hackers would find a way to bypass IP, and create a new primed account and obtain new hacks without spending on cases/keys = loss of opportunity revenue. Hence why you do see VAC bans on hacking accounts that have little to no inventory. But, its rare nowadays (keyword) to see them ban hacking accounts that have spent money on cases and keys. Also note, imagine telling your competition (like valorant) that player base has dropped 70%.. it doesn't look good in general. Again, it might get some users back, but until hackers just keep bypassing and hacking, the the same thing just reoccurs (people leave and hacking usage continously increases). Personally I don't think CSGO cares if the games becomes 100% HvH as long as it brings in them money. You can argue 'but a lot of people stream tournaments', which is absolutely true, but lets not forget, people that don't play cs anymore due to the hacking issues. and instead play other games still watch tournaments in general."

With the new operation you can earn stars as you complete the missions.

***Two of the world's best e-sports players, Julia Kiran and Zainab Turkie, have recently left the game Counter strike. The reason is the poor conditions for professional female players.***  
  
***- Now there is no future for women in Counter strike, says Effie Karabuda, game reporter at Swedish Radio.***

One week ago, Julia ""juliano"" Kiran announced that she was leaving the game Counter strike. In the same vein, colleague Zainab ""zAAz"" gave Turkey the same message.  
  
\- The CS scene is dead, especially for girls. As a professional player, there is nothing to pick up there anymore. I am against dividing women and men, but we must become better at supporting and highlighting women, says Julia Kiran in a video on the streaming service Twitch  
  
**""Hard jargon""**  
The two Swedish e-sports players are not alone in leaving the game. Female players around the world have already done the same.  
  
\- It's a pretty tough climate for girls. If you look at Counter strike as a game, it's hard jargon. As soon as you enter the game, it is an insult and people point out that you are a woman, says Effie Karabuda, game reporter at Swedish Radio.  
  
In addition to Julia Kiran and Zainab Turkie, relatively few women succeed in having a professional career in Counter strike  
  
\- There are not many sponsors or big tournaments for women so it is difficult to have a professional career and make money from it, says Effie Karabuda.  
  
**""A great statement""**  
Julia Kiran stopped, she posted a live video where she explained that she will now switch to the game Valorant, as many other women who leave Counter strike do.  
  
\- Julia Kiran and Sida Turkey are among the world's best e-sports players. So that they switch to Valorant is a big statement. I think it is Valorant that applies to female e-sports in the future, says Effie Karabuda.  
  
Valorant is largely reminiscent of Counter Strike but is perceived by many as more inclusive. The game was released in 2020 while Counter Strike was created in 1999."

I also continue to watch a lot of csgo content on YouTube like voocsgo, launders, nartouthere, karrigan and a few others. Once I felt I had put enough time into Aimlab I created a warmup routine using 3 workshop maps and 128 tick Deathwatch servers.

Keep in mind, CSGO is the go-to classical shooter that if anyone tries to make a clone of it, it would likely to fail because not many people likes another csgo game as much as they want another game like Halo or Titanfall 2 or Battlefield or Siege.

Adrix did argued how modern shooters had evolved pass CSGO when they introduced faster movement speed, vaulting, flying, charging, grenades had their own hotkeys, vehicles and mechs, grapple hooks, abilities and classes.

And yet, I still queue in the game, with no Prime and play competitive because I still love CSGO to this day."

An API key is (broken down to the most basic level) a password used to tell the other service that youre allowed to access it. Steam creates an API key for every user/game/application which can be used to give your own or other services access to more private information of the account and allow them to manage the account (change profile pictures/names/send trade offers, change game price in the store, etc.) thats why that key should only be shared with trusted 3rd parties or not shared at all.

the only option I see is that he got his iOS/android backup phished and someone cloned the phone, sent the offer from the app and accepted it from the same app.

Look at the market cap of CS:GO skins. Valve makes roughly 14% of the skin price on every single transaction that happens on their market. To rebuild that sort of market cap would take all of the years that CS has already been out.

You are referring to people buying keys as them having ""made all of their money,"" but that's negligible compared to the fact that most of the unboxed skins circulate the market indefinitely, with Valve taking a percentage of each sale every single time. 

This is all only considering the skin market. CSGO is among the world's most popular eSports, and there is massive infrastructure already in place for it. Uprooting the entire professional playerbase and community is completely unrealistic compared to simply providing an overhaul to an existing game. They've shown several times in the past that continued overhauls are their current plan."

It is true as most the comments say that I made a LOT of typos and some issues in setting up the review, I am totally on board with the idea that I can not play.

I would, however, most certainky like to point out when someone who not only refuses to atleast try to play on a team is hellbendt on being the only person, for whom it would be acceptable to take over a bot after dying.

I do see the irony in me writing something this thurough on something I in no way am an expert on, but feel that I as a part of the community have the respondsability to atleast at times show my displeassure in someone expecting the world to wrap around their pinkeyfinger.

I can most certainly say that I am not adequate for any score above a  6 (on a good day) for this review.
That being the language score, I am

I can not say that this player did not improve either, because OP stated they'd moved from a harsh rating of 2 to a 5. I commend them for getting better, and being more friendly than they were to me, showing they have learned something, likley not from my review, but from something, or someone. 

There must also be noted that this review was written over the time I was dead in CS, and may not seem to be coherent because it was broken up into segments  that i spendt writhing for 1-2 minutes at a time, I was pretty much mashing away at my keyboard because of frustration from the expectation of a player who could atleast manage to arrange the words in the correct order, and without 1-3 additional letters every 2-3 words. 

My mistake in this was that i expected someone who knew english. I still stand by my review, as to the reason that a reader should be capable of reading the date stamped to a comment and asser wether or not to see it as relevant as for the time of reading it.

A player who is bad is redeemable, where as an ignorat one is not. I may also say, none of theese things are written in stone, and they may change as time passes, evident by OP's statement on them further up the post."

I recommend watching Zipelcs youtube [video on how to avoid scams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qjSAjDCM6Q) first.

Scams / Sharks - **Yes, there are a lot of lurking scammers / sharks waiting to pounce on new people / returning people posting price checks queries**. (Lurking implying those not replying to thread directly) If you don't know about trading, please be very cautious, and don't rush to trade. You are better off holding on to your CS knife than to lose it to scammers / sharks. I can't explain more than ""be calm, don't be pressurised, don't get greedy, and check for possible scams - Fake Trade Bots, Phishing Links, etc"". 

If you want a reliable sale {cash}, you can reach out to the real zipelcs [via his twitter](https://twitter.com/zipelCS). He is willing to buy at 90% buff price.

Otherwise, [whitelisted per globaloffensivetrade subreddit - click via the links there](https://old.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/wiki/whitelist) for Bitskins / Skinport / Skinbaron.  Do check if it works for your country {for cashout methods}. If you are googling for these sites, do be very wary of fake websites listed on the google search page, lots of imitation.

Csgofloat / Buff Market works slightly different - but are better. However, you have to understand what is API, [and I recommend reading this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/comments/a5t6kc/psa_huge_csgo_youtuber_fell_for_the_fake_site/) before you ever create an API key.

While that’s important thing to do, what’s more important is how you will reform yourself and not relapse into betting again. 
Let close people know about your struggle. Let your close family member (who wouldn’t judge) or a friend or a girlfriend/boyfriend. Adopt another hobby. Make yourself busy. Go out there. Have fun outside. If you feel fidgety at nights, go to bed early. Shut down your PC. Put away your phone. Or even better, enjoy yourself with porn. Keep doing that, one day at a time. 

Relapsing into gambling again is no joke. It is as addictive as drugs. If you want to treat yourself, buy collectibles instead. Buy gaming chair. New keyboard. Upgrade your pc.

Theres no point buying skins, cases &amp; keys if you don't use them. If you make a new account, whats the point when your inventory is nothing. In the banned account, you see skin after skin. Its no difference from a gambling addict opening his wallet to see all the cash he won from the slot machine and going round 2 compared to someone thats sitting at the slot machine and opening up his wallet and finding its just his hard earned money instead."

He's gotten himself banned. He can now priorities other things in life, work, study, money. Instead of wasting money on a few pixels, he now has time to advance himself. If he's devoting 8 hours of gaming on CSGO, then now he has 8 hours of his life back. If he spent $1000 a week on CSGO keys and cases, he now has an extra $4000 a month of savings. To invest, save for a house instead of paying rent payments or sitting in moms basement, save for his college tuition. Obviously he has to restrain himself from making a new account, but that new account will have nothing in it. Its easier to quit something when you can see your loses, compared to opening up your wallet at a slot machine and see all your winnings and considering to throwing that money back into the slot machine. Gambling is an addiction. The same way you see some people go back to a strip joint and say 'I'll only use $50 for a lap dance', and 2 hours later, they've spent $800. They walk out, go home and sleep, and relise that they're now going to struggle for this months rent. So then they understand the consequences because of their addiction."

Anyway, I will explain it one last time and then I will block you, because I don't want to waste time on lying people.

The reason why I don't like the current system is because of the gambling aspect of it. Having the possibility of opening a crate for €2 and get a skin you can sell for +€100 can make people spend money on crates and keys that they in reality can't really afford to spend, and it introduces people to gambling at a young age.

If you want the possibility to sell your skins, fine then keep the skins tradeable and possible to list on the community market, but the skins should not be acquired through crates but bought in an in-game item shop. That way there is no gambling involved, and people can sell their skins if they no longer wants them."
2,2021-11-06,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/qnbmtd/why_i_got_myself_vac_banned_from_csgo/hjhlu1x/,"how? If you stop playing a game, that's not an addiction (time). If you stop buying cases and keys, that's not an addiction (money). You can sell off your PC that's deterring an addiction. The same way, you VAC ban yourself to stop an addiction. You can uninstall the game also to stop an addiction. OP saw his loses VAC ban (can't sell/trade inventory). If you sell your PC, you know you still have access to the account and can buy a new PC because you're addicted. If you uninstall the game, you know you can reinstall and access your inventory with thousands of skins still and the addiction continues. If you VAC ban, you understand what you lose (as again, you cant sell/trade it). If you make a new account, the thought is there that you have a account that's VAC banned and there's a reason you chose to go down that path. 

It's also not hard to stop smoking, but people go back to it. To these people, banning tobacco distribution would be a miracle for them as they no longer are able to obtain and use. Whilst they stare at the bank account and begin their calculations of loss due to their addiction. Not everyone is the same. You'll learn that later in your life. See that girl you're frothing over whilst you watch her insta stories and shit (addiction)? Whilst some other guy roots and boots her (not an addiction). What I'm trying to say is, not everyone is the same. You might not be addicted to gaming, or gambling, but you can have addictions elsewhere. I for one, spend countless hours day trading on the exchange. To me, that's an addiction. Can I get off it? Nope. I see the gain, I see the losses. Can I pull out and throw money back into my own savings account to stop? Yes. Can I stop financial institutions from allowing payments to the exchange? Yes (that's similar to a VAC ban). OP has stopped himself and it acts as a hurdle. It's up to him whether he wants to 'jump' over the barrier again."

+strafe means that as long as the key is held you can move your character by moving the mouse. It allows you to move your character very slowly and accurately.

Faceit is not the way for a beginner, especially since its your first time with mouse and keyboard mechanicals. Faceit might be an option if you might want to take the competitive CS a bit more competitive later on. Nothing you want to dwell into with no practice and experience. Faceit is nothing you need to ponder over until you might feel that the experience through normal matchmaking is not enough for you.

Other replies are good. Go to workshop on steam and get the aimbotz, yprac maps and such.

There you can practice your mechanical skills with aim and spray control and map knowledge.

Play casual and deathmatch to get more used to real players without having to worry about the competitive stuff.

And otherwise dont worry too much about playing competitive match making, you will get better in time, enjoy the competitive match making. You are not gonna wreck players instantly but learn from the experience. 

Practice is something you will have to do. You will get better and you will gain experience. Some things you might learn quick, some things might take a bit of time.

There might be tutorials on youtube as well. But the main thing is getting practice and getting used to the mechanics of the game. Remember its a game, dont get crazy serious for no reason. Enjoy what you can, be patient and learn from mistakes."

A jumpthrow bind is really useful, to throw perfect smokes, but you don’t really have to worry about that in the beginning.

A buy script (using keys instead of the buy menu) is mostly used by people coming from other cs interations and never bothered to learn how to use the „new“ buy menu.

Binding grenades to individual keys is also a good idea(I have flash on F, HE on G, Molotov 4, Smoke 5) as you don’t need to cycle through every Grenade in your inventory to get the one you want, but again rather a QoL thing than necessary to enjoy the game.

I’d recommend playing around with all of that and see what fits your gameplay well and what doesn’t. No need to use some weird bind a pro uses if it makes you feel uncomfortable."

I watched a lot of videos and pro matches before I started playing csgo at all. My first 10 matches were quite challenging but I was ranked SEM and it didnt take long until I reached GN1 and from there it was a slow and steady climb. I always made sure I did my warmup before each game and tried my best to outplay my opponents and always being unpredictable. I tried very hard not to tilt even if we lost and gave my team as much information as I could to increase the chances of winning. I didn't win every game but I have a solid winrate above 50% and in almost all games (except when I was on the final 3 ranks LE, LEM, SMFC) i was the top fragger or at least at the top 3 of the scoreboard. 

As usual I got accused of cheating a lot and tbh if I played against myself I would call myself a cheater aswell lmao. The key thing I am missing is that I am extremely inconsistent sometimes and it makes me look like I toggled in the eyes of my opponents, but I guess being inconsistent is part of the csgo experience lol.


What I would like to recommend anyone who would like to get better at CS is to watch a ton of pro matches and I can't stress this enough: aim warmup as often as you can. If I didnt use ulleticals Aim_Botz custom map to practice my aim I wouldn't have been this good tbh. I often see people just launching cs and instantly going for a comp match without warmup. Thats one of the biggest mistakes you can make. Always do a proper warmup."

He shoots me with a souvenir awp dragon lore. He then drains and salts my dead corpse and hangs me out to dry in the basement. After the ageing process is completed he processes me into beef jerkey. He sells this beef jerkey and makes profit off of it. He then decides to open a cs20 case and pulls an awp wildfire mw and it reminds him of me and brings a tear to his eyes. He then realizes how bad he messed up and yearns for the one thing he can’t buy with money. Me his lover back

The problem started when he went to the local gas station. He picked up a large bottle of jack daniels whiskey off of the shelf. He goes to the counter and pays the man. Gaben then went home and drank until he could see the bottom of the bottle. He did this everyday like a routine for a very long time. One day he woke up and decided he’s done if he can’t get what he wants most then what’s the point in living. He climbed to the top of the valve building. He stared at all the life below wondering why did he have to be born as gaben and not someone who had found love. He takes one last pull of jack and he feels the comforting burn in his chest. He then sucks up his pride and jumps. He might be remembered in the hearts of many for some time. But in the end he will be forgotten just like anyone else.

Im sure that this is true, because on a bad day I might clear an angle by looking too much up/down or too much width.

 &gt;Cross-dominance, also known as mixed-handedness, hand confusion, or mixed dominance, is a motor skill manifestation in which a person favors one hand for some tasks and the other hand for others, or a hand and the contralateral leg. For example, a cross-dominant person might write with the right hand and do everything else with the left one, or manage and kick a ball preferentially with the left leg. Overall, being mixed handed seems to result in better performance than being strongly handed for sports such as basketball, ice hockey, and field hockey.

Also you could end up logging thousands of games where this never occurred and you wasted all the time studying those logs.

It’s also very likely that there is nothing off with the y-axis variable. You can see that there is something that forces the picture to shake when the bug occurs, probably because there are inconsistencies and I guess the y axis stays normal, because every other player sees you standing on the ground.

Please try removing any in-game customizations you have made in CS:GO. To do this, you will need to move or delete your config.cfg file from its current location.

The only thing that Valve sets is the price of a key in the ingame shop which you use to open cases. Anything that happens after is up to the market. a knife is priced at 450 because the owner of the skin sets the price at 450 if he expects that the buyer is willing to pay that. It is called a MARKETPLACE for a reason. Valve has nothing to do with the prices there lol

If noone would want the skins, every skins price would drop to 0.03 as noone wants to buy so if you want to sell, you have to lower the price.

A good example is the game Battalion 1944. The game has skins. When the game was new, there were skins for hundreds of dollars. Now the game is dead, every skin is 0.03 on the market, because noone buys anything. No demand = no high price."

If you want a shiny knife or a cool skin for your favorite weapon, you have to either be lucky to unbox it from a container, or buy it from the marketplace.

Since you have to at least spend 2$ per case just for the key to open it, each skin has at least some value to begin with.

Blue skins (the skins with the blue background which indicates the rarity of the skin) are the most common ones, followed by purple, pink, red and gold. Gold is the rarest type which are either gloves or knifes, depending on which container you open. These have a rarity of ~0.26% which is very rare. You're more likely to get a blue skin which have a rarity of around 70%. edit: its actually 80%

This alone makes these skins very rare and expensive to get from opening containers. Which means the supply cant meet demand. Thid drives up the cost of these rare skins which explains why certain knifes and skins are worth thousands of dollars. And because these skins are tradable and csgo is one of the most popular games, they hold their value. Often times even increasing in value as time goes on.

The most expensive skin i believe was traded for $150,000 which was an AK-47 Case hardened with a rare pattern, minimal wear stat track edition with 4 very rare and expensive stickers. Here is a [link](https://blog.lootbear.com/most-expensive-csgo-skin/) if you want to see for yourself.

There is also a mechanic called 'trade-ups' in csgo. This allows you to basically merge 10 skins of a rarity (e.g. Blue) into 1 higher tier skin (in this example purple). This automatically makes lower tier skins a little more worth since players can basically buy these lower tier skins and trade them up for higher tier skins, essentially deleting 10 skins from existence and slowly declining the supply of these lower tier skins, which in turn drives up their cost.

Csgo skins is a very complicated thing and I think it's quite interesting, even though I have no interest in buying these expensive skins"

But it kinda worked out in the end because I sold most of my skins I didn’t use anymore and got about 500$ worth of steam money that I’ve been buying games with ever since.

The way I understand the mechanics, is that you want to stop as fast as absolutely possible. So by keep holding down your D key, you are negating the effectiveness of the counter strafe. 

What I would do is I let go of D, tap A, and then hold both A and D. 

Reason being if I keep the D key depressed, while simultaneously pressing A, I’m telling the game to accelerate me both left and right at the same time, effectively cancelling each other out, and thus being equivalent of not pressing either buttons. 

What I do instead is, when m I let go of D, I stop giving the game a “move right” command, and only gives it a “move left” command. This means I give the game a command to counteract my movements to the right, and I stop sooner, meaning I will be accurate faster.

If you want to hold both keys depressed, that is an option, you just need to let go of D until you have stopped moving completely, and only then can you hold both keys down, to keep you still."

I wouldn't be suprised if valve has like 1-2 dudes sitting there for 1 week putting everything together and just publish it as ""the new shit"". They don't fix anything... they don't care 'bout the feedback from the community. Funniest part is: You get like 100 cases, kay? Let's say you spend 1€ per case (bought them from the market) which means that valve got 15% from your 1€ already = 0.15€\*100... which is 15€.. you buy 100 keys which are another 250€. 265€ for valve and you got nothing out of it so far. You've spend 350€ already... and now you open the cases... let's say you get 400€ worth of skins (which is unrealistic because most skins cost less than 1€).. so you have profit right? Nah... you don't... if you sell all items on the market... valve takes another 15% from the sold skins... so 15% of 400€ are 60€. Valve got 325€ and you have 10€ minus... yikes... fuck valve.

EDIT// Imagine how many money they made on a low price skin that has been around for years. Just imagine a skin that is worth 1€ (and the price is stable)... and it gets traded every week for... idk... 4 years. They get 0.15€ each time which is 4\*52\*0.15€... they made 31.2€ from a 1€ skin just over time.. and they invested no money in it because one more skin doesn't add anything... they maybe had to get a few more resource sto handle the additional trades but come on... this skin gets traded like 100 times a day. Which already is 15€ a day... so... yeah.. fuck valve bro.. JUST FUCK EM!"

1. I live in Sweden, so I play que with players from Sweden, Finland, Russia, Poland, Turkey, Germany and so on. 50% of players are from Russia. Have not had any big issues as long I dont tilt and flame. 
2. This is 4th for 5th time I get to Global, I created another account to play with some irl friends and ""accidently"" won alot and ranked Global on that account aswell. First time I reached Global was after about 500h back in 2016. A combination of many years of competetive Call of Duty and Battlefield made my learning curve shorter  and easier to get to Global back then
3. Started at rank AK and Double AK
4. Learned that your impact in the game ""HLTV rating"" is far more important than winning the actual game. MM does not work like Faceit. 
5. My best tip on SoloQ would first of all, keep your emotions in check. If you are at a bad mood, dont play competitive. Play a more casual game, go outside or anything that makes you better. 
6. The biggest difference betweek ranks in MM and Faceit is not just raw aim, it´s the more tactical part. Every opponent play differently, some very aggressive and some very passive. Dont just play ""by the book"", I play really aggressive and often getting called for being braindead by the enemy team. But dont ever overextend. 
7. **(This is joke, but have a bit of truth in it)** Get a russian girlfriend, been with mine for almost 7 years. You learn how to handle them xD
8. No 5 man stack, you will play against other 5 man stacks. Even if I played against full level 10s with 2500-3000 elo on mm, it´s pretty rare. 
9. Kill 100-200 bots before a game. You can find it in workshop, it takes about 10 minutes to warmup. I often skip this but I play many FPS with all same sens.

You want to peek most angles as possible using only A or D, this so you can counter-strafe.

Counterstrafing is when you are moving to a direction (Either left or right) you tap the opposite key to instantly stop... Allowing you to be precise faster.

Why do you need to do this?

Because in csgo, rifles (All weapons really but mainly rifles) can't be shot accurately when moving. And even if you let go of the keys there's a ""De-acceleration"" period. And by counter strafing you eliminate that time.

Configuration:

Also, before anything else I'd recommend getting the ""Correct"" / recommended settings first:

- Getting a sensitivity which isn't too high too low
- You could try 4:3 if you want, is not mandatory
- Binding your nades to individual keys is very good and should be done as soon as possible because there is a transition period

Economy:

Undertanding the economy of the game is essential. 

When to buy, what to buy, etc. Some tips are:

- Use MP9 is good
- Don't buy helmet when you know the Terrorists have AK's
- See what your team has!!! It doesn't matter if you have or don't have money. If everyone buys It's better to fuck up together than you saving money. 
- Utility &gt; Rifle if you don't have money and you play on a utility heavy site (Like B dust, A mirage).

Communication:

Is very good to communicate with the other players, even if they don't talk back. Giving calls, saying if you are going to do something dumm, saying sorry and nice try goes a long way too

Mentality: (Yeah, seriously) 

Csgo is a very frustrating game, there are cheaters, smurfs, toxic assholes, etc. And is very hard not to get tilted, but always try to remember 1 game is nothing in the ""grand scheme"" of things 

But most importantly, your self reflective mentality is important. Is good to know that when you aren't having a good day, you aren't playing as good as you usually play, try not to get in a bad mood as it's only going to be worse... Just play more passive, etc. 

And thats about everything to get you ""started"" on csgo. But there's basic strats you should know and a tooon more. But yeah step by step."

The reason I'd argue movement over aim (first that is), is because movement actually helps with your aim, indirectly. And the reason for that is that having good movement sort of conditions you to aim at head level at all times, or close to it. When you're doing that, you're more likely to get headshots or at least position your shots in the right place and usually spray thereafter.  After that , you can work on your aim. One key difference though is, if it's not obvious, work on them at the same time, but just place a slightly higher emphasis on movement over aim, for the time being. So instead of surfing (for now), you could do DM or AIM botz/CSGoHub, but spread them out a bit so u get some work on your movement (and aim) as well. If the bots are too close, then you're not moving around as much, and thus working more on your aim. So good movement, should generally look as much as a straight line, but like with most game skills, it takes practice. 

Competitive CS:GO is not a place where you can just run around and shoot people, but instead, what's great about it, is that, (for me at least), you have to ""earn your kills."" Some ways of doing that instead of just running around and shooting players is learning the importance of walking in the game (so your enemy doesn't hear you), using utility to clear out tough angles/spots, and just kind of moving around the map to gather information about the enemy and predict where they might be. So the kills imo, are harder to get, but also more rewarding. There's a psychological component as well to the game, based on you and your opponent's behavior and how they interact with one another. I've also written an [article](https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/how-to-rank-up-fast-in-csgo) (Gamersdecide) on ranking up/tips for CS:GO based on this factor, but no worries if you decide not to read it. So a few examples could be something as simple as your opponent going to the same site (putting aside the frustration) because it's working or mabye going B once in awhile to throw you off, but predominantly focusing on the A site . Or someone playing more aggressive to gain the early man advantage or balance it back out; therefore you might be more likely to expect a push or early lurk. Of course, it's important to keep track of this information and see whether it's consistent or not, otherwise you might have to change strategies.  Just a few examples. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other things to take into consideration, generally speaking (and I wont go into too much detail) is 1) game roles (not just before, but during a game, depending on the situation), such as entry fragger/lurker and whether it's appropriate or not to do so at this time/round, or changing roles in game (such as picking up an AWP or a teammate who's struggling as an entry fragger) 2) positoning, as in varying where u hide or lurk, but if you change every round, that's ironically also predictable, so it's okay to stay in the same spots, once in awhile, esp if its working, 3) learning to spray, since getting headshots all the time isn't practical, 4) util usage, since dry peeking every corner will pretty much leave your player dead, and 5) game sense, which although isn't a tangible factor, like aim, can help you get more frags and position yourself better overall, ex. for a retake or choosing the correct site if they plan to plant near the end of the round, for example. Game sense would kind of be like analyzing your opponent's behavior based on not just the previous round, but a cumulation of rounds. Sometimes though, it's not rocket science, players are just finding openings and taking advantage of them or taking sites because certain opposing players, cant hold them for example.

Sorry for the long reply. Goodluck."

Install Fresh drivers from nVidia's site.  


While in safe mode, make sure you check all the HP ""software"" that was installed and get rid of most of it, it's just bloatware.  


IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK, check bellow.  


do a fresh windows install like this:

1. Make sure your PC is linked to your microsoft account so that the key is linked to the Hardware ID and you won't have to reactivate it.
2. Get Windows Media Creation Tool.
3. Get a USB Stick with at least 16GB of available space.
4. Download the most  important drivers and software: Chipset, GPU. Also download DDU and keep it, just in case. Also get something like WinRar, chrome, installers for Steam and whatever else you are using.
5. Create the Windows installation image on the stick.
6. After Step 5 is fully completed, create a folder on the stick and copy the drivers and software to that folder.
7. Backup all data from your current installation  but don't worry about stuff you can redownload (like game files). Just save settings if you think you need them.
8. Do a fresh Windows install, skip the screen where it asks for a key.
9. As soon as it's done, go to Settings &gt; Advanced System Settings &gt; Hardware &gt; Device Installation Settings &gt; ""NO"" &gt; Apply &amp; Ok.
10. DO NOT ALLOW HP TO INSTALL ANY PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE!
11. Install the latest chipset drivers.
12. Restart.
13. Install the latest nVidia Driver.
14. Restart.
15. Update Windows.
16. Ignore all software and driver updates, focus only on Windows related stuff.
17. Restart.
18. If there are stuff that you need to disable, check WinAero Tweaker - it's a bit dangerous as you can cause issues, but if you know what you are doing, it's very useful for disabling Windows Bloatware.
19. Install Steam and CSGO and check again."
1,2022-01-07,u/word89,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/rx4od1/please_start_a_discussion_about_how_to_fix_vac/hrnb06q/,"You wouldn't want me to do that....  First, Your a troll on Reddit with a literal ""throwaway"" for an account. One of millions of others out there , all a walking joke of a meme on the internet, hiding behind a keyboard. Wow.  I'd imagine if you do this in your spare time, you're probably a cheater as well. 

I digress to your level of logic first, though second now I'll explain more thoroughly what's coming for the likes of you and your trolling game cheating mates.

Detection is a bit more complex then I've described. I simplified my description for your under the bridge mind to wrap itself around, to be honest. 


The only difficult thing about anti cheat is catching the sophisticated programs that change their signature with each injection of artificial code. This is however also a cop out. Its very easy to detect. 

The game operates in a specific fashion. Specific mechanics. 99.9% of hacks inject code that falls out of these specific mechanics. 

The hard part of detection is in microadjustments from a player in an FPS Game. Sophisticated hacks mask their code injections by using relative crosshair placement and microadjustments, as if it were organic motion from the user. Simple hacks are entirely blatant, like spinbots, aimbots, or info assistance like wall hacks. Game mechanics compared to blatant hack behavior are immediately detected. Why they aren't immediately banned is a different subject entirely. 

For sophisticated hacks,The difference between a hacks input and an organic users input is that the hack always leaves a pattern. While 99.99% of normal users input is random at best. Only appearing calculated with a very good users playing style. While hacks attempt to mimic a user with a good playing style. However always leaving a pattern in how it aim assists or provides more info to the user of the hack program. 

A simple algorithm comprised of normal - advanced game mechanics, would easily detect outliers. The outliers being really good players, blatant hackers, and hackers with sophisticated programs. Yet while complimenting the algorithm by pairing it with network packet monitoring, the detection monitoring would pick out hackers like a single pin in an amazon warehouse of hay bales. 

Within 1-2 rounds (3 minutes on average) of game play, while monitoring user input mechanics, the outlier - or SUSpect, would be detected. Then immediately confirmed by either blatant artificial input in network packets, or immediately confirmed by signature changes in user network packets. Both are a confirmed blatant use, or confirmed signature change from the user's side of the network. 

Though this isn't anything new. This is how all successful hack detection software operates.  VAC - or more specifically, VACnet, is actually already developing this process for Steam and CSGO. 

Somewhat quietly though, because they - Valve - only really started doing so around the end of last year. It should have been done years ago and already implemented, by the example of just about every other gaming platform, professional or private leagues, having already done so years ago as well. They already use a system as I have described. They immediately ban the users as well, without prejudice. 

The current work around is hitting hackers with red trust factors, until it is completed for deployment on all Steam servers. As Overwatch can be smurfed, hackers using farm accounts or using multiple accounts purchased or otherwise, along with VAC bypass software, the servers are currently still the wild west for hackers. 

There have been Pros, community advocates, regular players, even Valve developers, all speaking out publicly that CS has been a cesspool of hackers for too long. A safe haven, even. We all just need to apply some more pressure to speed things along and deploy the system to Steam servers that already works with what is essentially 100% efficiency. 

Can't wait to see it happen to be honest. All the likes of you will be gone. For CSGO; Your farm accounts, your trolling of normal players, your greifing in matchmaking, etc. There should be a noticeable drop in prices on the CSGO economy, once the system is deployed as well. No more farm accounts to spoof prices! 

Oh and a nice little side note, most of the current hack softwares out there have been a wonderful data comparison to build the new detection system. Why shut them down when you can infiltrate them all internally, learn from them, and eradicate them all with one deployment? After all, there's really only a handful of ways to mimic the same code that  game mechanics operate on :-). 

Detection bypassing software is also included. They already get dropped from the network after a short time period now, from being unable to provide login certificates. A small number of bypassers re-spoof their network connection to continue playing and not get dropped. Both of these loopholes will be closed. 

This new system will also cover all games on the Steam platform. Not just CS. I do personally appreciate Valve working on this quietly, as they have done so with good reason. Though I would like hackers gone today, like anyone... It will however be well worth the wait  to see them all disappear, essentially wiped out by their own hand. Their own work at building hacks being the same process that is going to eliminate them. 

Having literally taught detection software how to find them with extreme efficiency. Idiots."

Change Email and Password

Revoke any Steam API Keys (https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)

De-auth anything linked to 2-Factor (Steam &gt; Settings &gt; Account &gt; Manage Steam Guard Security &gt; Deauthorize all computers)

And that’s literally it. If you want to go overkill, contact steam support and ask them to lock the account.

I would get in a lobby with 4 people who were queued together and i would get kicked everytime. Can't make it out of silver now even though I'm almost always top frag. Playing with friends makes the game 100x better. Even if you lose. 

The first thing you're going to want to adjust is your mini map. You should be able to set sizes from the settings menu or you can go through console developer options. ( console developer options is better IMO, but it will take some figuring out. Great YT videos and tutorials on it. ) For example I play 90% nuke competitive. If you're setting back ramp when the bomb is planted the sound may throw you off as to if it's A or B. Being able to read the mini map and seeing teammates locations will tell you where the bomb is before ever having to ask A or B. 

You will also want keybinds for all grenades IMO. Disable that scroll wheel ASAP, I don't mind playing with new players at all. But way to often I see them bite a bullet because they're cycling through grenades. I have a specific key for everything in the game and some items are doubled to my mouse. Easy access. 

I saw someone mention the recoil maps to you. I'm posting this from mobile so hopefully these are the right links if someone else hasn't sent them.

This is an awp only map, pretty fun with friends^ retro style map.

There are tons of things in csgo you can add or change via the console options. You can change the character FOV and even how far your character bobs up, down, left, right when you move. I have mine completely disabled so mine is a still character even when I run.

Then you can break csgo down even further into what resolution you play. There are advantages and disadvantages to both sides. This is a huge debate in the csgo community. I personally play on a 1920x1080 monitor on a 4:3 resolution stretch. So I'm actually running 1440×1080. This will stretch your game across the X axis of the screen making your character and other characters a little wider. Easier to shoot. But because you're stretching your resolution you lose some of your vision radius. Both your left and right side will actually see less of the game. 

I wouldn't advise messing with resolution or FOV in a competitive lobby as it will screw up your eDPI following the changes. I would play a DM or casual game to mess with those. 

Either way if you have questions or anything I can try to help you. If you add me just let me know your username because I have a pile of random friend requests.

Dont spend too much on this i myself have a basic logitech office keyboard and it gets the job done dont spend more than 60 bucks on a keyboard i recommend

If you have a fine Headset you dont need a mic

Can recommend Logitech G332 around 40 $

Mic

really you dont need this if your headset mic is fine

You can still make an unlinked NFT with a copy of a Bored Ape image and have it be an NFT. The token is unique, the image isn't. Whether people call it an NFT doesn't matter to me, the token is unique, thus it's an NFT. Plus they aren't rare. I can pump out as many NFTs as I want with the same image, they'll still be NFTs. People wouldn't spend as much, but they're still NFTs. CSGO skins ensure some value or minimum price based off the key/case cost and the rarity. If I buy an NFT for X amount, what ensures I can sell it for more? If I buy a CSGO skin for under market price, I can nearly certainly sell it for more."

1) Blue gems are actually very rare on a centralized system where it is difficult(actually impossible) to duplicate items. NFTs on the other hand, you can deploy your own contract and give yourself unlimited amount of NFTs and do whatever the fuck you want. You can literally create your own NFT of other's ""art work"" and deploy on the same blockchain nobody can do shit about it. 

2) you can't screenshot a bluegem and equip it in game and flex on official servers or stream yourself playing with those skins (what basically ppl do with skins) but you can screenshot a image and do whatever ppl do with their NFT monkey pictures. Exclusive events for NTF holders is just an add on to that but you really need to see how worth those events are. If it's something like a ticket to concert of your favorite band and the price tag is same as the ticket, then only NFTs are actually being used the right way and for right cause. 

End of the day NFTs are application of a technology that has a lot of use cases with some trade offs. It's quite sad that this Wonderful technology is used for nothing other than scams."

I killed the first one of long and had no clue where the last one was. Sneakd arround the Statue (Bomb was planted towards Hut) and wanted to fake defuse. The second I start defusing I suddenly hear what i thought will be my death. Very close Steps and the bullets of a PP-Bizon. I do not remember where he came from but he was straight behinde me and I was watching into the statue. I actually did not even react to the shooting I just made a jump in my chair because I was coucht so offguard. While jumping I had my mouse in hand and literally made a 360, hit my keyboard with the mouse mid 360, therfore noscope head shooted my opponent straight out of the map.

So for example, I can go back and forth between 1920 x1080 and 1400 x 1050 (or 1280 x 960) 4:3 stretched by pressing control 7 or control 8. You also might have to go into ur GPU/Integrated Graphics Cards settings and change it there as well. For me it's the intel graphics command center (laptop). Desktop I think is under-display settings and you can just change it there, with my laptop I couldn't do that though; there were more steps involved. Lastly, double-check under display from your computer's settings to make sure the changes are there. I wrote an [article (Gamersdecide)](https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/csgo-best-resolutions) on this along with some tutorial videos, but you don't have to read it all, you can just check out the videos or just go on youtube and search ""How to change CS:GO display on laptop/desktop."" It might vary as well depending on your graphics card. All in all, I prefer 4:3 stretched now just cuz it feels more immersive IMO, but the quality deteriorates a bit since the images are stretched out a bit more. Some give and take."

if this doesnt make sense its just pressing whichever slope you are in with its direction ie if its right you press down move right key.

when in a slope, you are currently climbing up stairs but indirectly. you dont use forward but rather go against where the slope is in meaning if the slope is upwards to right, you only press right. that way the game thinks you are climbing the slope while having the forward momentum from falling downwards. combining these factors make you float on a slope sideways, and with the way how momentum works here, combining sideway and forward momentum actually boosts your movement speed. like if you watch someone else surf, they move their cameras right along pressing down move right key. this is also on bhopping but this is how you turn left and right moving onto another platform."

If you want to continue playing with bots, make sure they're at least EXPERT bots.  Should be somewhere near the top of the screen before starting a match...

...but I wouldn't even waste time with bots.  They might teach you bad habits, and you won't get any knowledge on how any real humans play the game.

I'd hop into casual and learn from there.  If you care about rank (and you probably will at some point, but shouldn't, because MM is broken in NA), I wouldn't even play your ranking-matches before 250-500 hours.  When you want to start this, learn 1 or 2 maps very well, and only queue for those.  Add more as you learn more maps later.

If you think you'll be spending some time (1000+ hours) on the game, learn spray patterns and spray control.  Learn smoke lineups (youtube videos).  

Use your mic effectively.  Communicate quickly and succinctly, and then STFU.  Let them play/hear.  Don't be toxic.  (there are many)

If you are going to spend some time in this game (again, 1000+ hours), buy a large mouse pad, and turn your eDPI (effective DPI) of your mouse down to 500-800.  

My last and most important piece of advice:  get a good set of headphones and TURN THEM UP.  Information is VITAL in this game.

Good luck and don't buy keys."

Also it is a lot harder to invade Russia from Finland than it is from Ukraine, first it is not really mountainy, but it is compared to Ukraine, second, Russia only has to hold 3 key points if NATO was invading from Finland since Finland as well as Sweden and Norway is just an island connected to Russia at 3 points (you can just see it for yourself at map) also a part of Russia is part of that ""island"" but it's not really important part.

Some examples since I decided to accept every friend request that I get:

* Someone is gonna ask you to play/vote for their team on a *totally 100% legit tournament site* that conveniently is going to request you to sign in with your steam. Let's be honest, if you are good enough to play in a team, you would probably be on one already through other means, and do you really want to vote for someone that adds random people on steam to inflate their numbers?

* Someone will say that they are interested in one of your items, but they need to know a value that doesn't exist and can be seen on this *totally 100% legit skin inspecting site* that requires you to log in with your steam account. If the site linked is not FloatDB or CSGO exchange and they are looking for something that isn't float or pattern, it's probably a scam. 

* Someone will say that you can open some cases on *totally 100% legit case opening site*, you will probably win something, but you will have to sign in with your steam account and deposit something. Don't gamble csgo skins in general, but especially don't do it on shady sites that nobody has heard of.

* Someone will say that they are interested in buying some of your skins with a knife (usually overpaying by a lot) and say to pick one that they have listed on a legit website. But then they will either give a link that looks legit, but is wrong when you look closely (e. g. dmarrket, instead of dmarket), Or they will just say that they want to avoid trade holds by converting your items into TF2 keys and trade those and do some other trade shenanigans.

The rule of thumb is, that if it isn't a steam trade offer with one item being traded for another one in the same offer (still each item offered should be inspected carefully since there are misleading items), it's a scam."

Id also like to note that I've lost the last 6 games and got deranked to MG2 even though I have the highest kills, lowest deaths, most MVPS &amp; highest KDR of all 10 players in the game, but my team are so badly matched that I cant carry.

I think part of my problem is that I only queue for agency these days which has a queue time of about 8 minutes. I've found that maps with not enough people ends up queuing you with any available person just to get you into a game which leads to really imbalanced matchmaking. You end up with S2-3's accusing you of wall hacking when you can clearly hear the hostage breathing above you.

It annoys me that I used to rate CSGO as the best FPS game of all time and now I cant stand to play it. How has every update resulted in the game getting worse?!? They took the game free to play to experiment their ValveNET project (server sided anti cheat detection), which turned out to be utterly useless, and not only that, but because the game went F2P and new accounts were automatically given prime status, everyone bot created 1000 accounts, downloaded free cheats and even to this day, people are cheating with throw away accounts because they got the game free with prime status, which has resulted in a large portion of the player base to play on unofficial match making servers or quit the game completely. 

SO glad I never bought skins or crate keys."

The Razer mice are technically among the fastest, but even the Viper Mini isn't all that ""mini"", so if you need a smaller mouse (like me with my, apparently, infant hands) you'll have to look elsewhere.

I'm currently on the go, i.e. not at my usual desk, so I got myself a SteelSeries Rival 3 which is also technically among the zooming fast mice, and I can hit a few things with it, but for my hands it's just a little bit too bulky.

My main gaming mouse is a Glorious Model O- which is ultra-light and very low, perfect for my hands, but it's technically not among the lowest-latency mice. I do hit more/better with it than with the SteelSeries, though.

But if your hands or your gripping method allow it, then purely because of the technical advantages, I would recommend a Razer Viper 10/10 times. 

Just hope you never need their support, I had the worst experience in ANY support case with them recently. After a certain point, I felt like they were being dicks on purpose, just for the fun of it, sending me one-by-one ""please provide this number"", ""please provide that number"" requests, only to bully me around and test how far they can go before I'd start swearing and calling them names. As a customer (2 keyboards, 3 mice) they've lost me forever. Two products have been sent back, the other 3 will either be sold or thrown out the window as soon as I'm not on the move anymore.

I didn't make this, and I forgot where I found this, probably [somewhere on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/5jkst3/mouse_click_latency_spreadsheet/). But it's a list of latency timings (=""how soon after doing something with the mouse will the computer actually know about it"", i.e. the lower the better) with some very insightful data.

You'd still need to remodel the thing to work in the other game - it being an NFT or not doesn't change that.

All that's needed is a given to skin to have some existence in both games and for them to agree that purchases work for both.

How that purchase works is where an NFT might be handy, but really it seems like it would still just be more hassle than it's worth. If you buy skin A for CSGO you could have your accounts linked so you automatically get it in CoD. You might get a key to unlock the skin in CoD. Or you might buy an NFT from some marketplace that is linked to both games and unlocks it in both - or you know, you might simply buy a skin bundle from some marketplace that is linked to both games and unlocks it in both.

From a reselling POV having the skins bundled, say with an NFT seems worse, in that I can't sell my CoD skin (that I'm not using) separately from my CSGO skin as both are locked into the NFT."

Good guns for rushing - Mac 10
Good eco pistol - Tec 9 or five seven

Best guns - M4 and ak47

If you buy utility use it. Don't just die and leave it for enemy to use.

If you cannot afford M4 or ak47 on a buy round buy galil or FAMAS.

Stay away from AWP it's too expensive for a noob to be using. I see many noobs buy/use it like 4 rounds straight and they get 1 kill. When they could have dropped a team mate an M4 instead who has much better ADR.

Kills and points don't matter. ADR does. Try and do as much damage to other team as possible whilst staying alive. Staying alive is the key to success. As you can use numbers to trade and win sites or defend sites.

I suggest also picking 1 map and playing it for a few months straight. Like inferno. You won't learn as much if you keep switching maps and having to learn everything on the new map like smoke line ups, where you can position yourself and re- position.

Never play the same position all game switch it up slightly to keep enemy guessing. If I see a retard in the same position we will just triple nade or double flash peek and kill him."

Ok, so I advise you to start learning utility in order to block the awpers on key spots. You can also learn flashes/pop-flashes. Some games its just impossible and you will die to every single fight, but thats just bad luck.

Jiggles peeks are also a good idea if you want to bait the first shot of the awper, right after he shoots you can win him the angle and with a good crosshair placement and reflexes you can take him down if he peeks again :)"

4,2022-05-05,u/DBatou,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/uirs8x/tips_please/i7emjqy/,"""Skill"" in CSGO is often talkes about along 3 different dimensions and I thought I'd give you some beginner tips for each. i tried to include key words so you know what to google for if you want more info.  


1) aim/mechanics  


Did you know? If you hold a rifle/sniper and you run while shooting, you have terrible accuracy? This is called movement inaccuracy and while it applies to pistols and SMGs as well, rifles/snipers are borderline unusable while running. So what you want to do is when you run around a corner, you want to run around the corner sideways using the ""A"" (or ""D"") button and then once you are in the open very lightly tap the opposite direction key ""D"" (or ""A"" alternatively) to make your character stop faster in order to shoot accurately faster. This takes some practice but is a key skill called ""counter strafing"".

&amp;#x200B;

2) game sense

Always try to aim where you expect an opponent (or more precisely an opponents head) to be. These are the easiest kills to get basically but the require you to have an understanding where enemys can be at any given point in the round. Think of the enemys position as a ""cloud of likelyhood"".

If you get surprised and have to wildly swing your crosshair around this is called a ""flick"" and while it is a mark of high skill to consistently hit your flick shots as a beginner you should focus on reducing the amount of times where you have to flick around. Don't practice flicks yet, learn how to avoid having to flick.  :)

Try to never stand in the open without cover.  


3) Communication / Team work

Team work makes the dream work. Your teammates can help you win fights easily and are your most precious resource. When a teammate is fighting the enemy consider this as him taking aggro from the enemy so you might just have the opportunity to swing out of cover and take fights without being shot at.

Cover your teammates and have your teammates cover you.

If you die try to communicate what you saw of the enemy. How many? Were they close already? Did you see the bomb? This is key information to help your team make the correct ""macro decisions"" of where to rotate the players. 

Easiest example: You died close to bombsite B and saw 4 enemys + the bomb? Your teammates from A should start rotating B."

One day, a guy I’m friends with was like “yo, that’s a sick knife btw”. I was like “thanks”. He didn’t state that knives in CSGO were so rare.

I was in the same position with you, I moved from console to pc and my first game was CSGO. It will take a little bit of time to get comfortable but less than you think imo.

There are many reasons not to use a controller, your aim will be a lot less clean and its just generally more sluggish for all aspects of aiming and moving around with a controller.

Also keyboard is key for cs. Some places you need to jump up to in maps require you to jump and crouch to get a slight height boost, I'm pretty sure its not even possible to do this on a controller. Likewise using your keyboard will allow you to set up binds for certain things which you couldn't do on a controller.

I can't think of a single benefit to using a controller it is definitely a disadvantage at best and at worst a total hindrance as you may not even be able to do certain things like the crouch jumps etc.

I have over 3k hours in cs and played at a highish level (level 8 games on faceit and was a level 6 myself) whilst this isn't amazing I feel like I can try give you some tips!

Aim train! - download workshop maps like recoil masters to practice your spray control and aim botz to practice your tap firing, when you begin to feel more comfortable go in DM servers, valve DM servers are fine, there are community servers too and faceit has their own DM servers which is what I personally use.  You should work on your aim placement, learn where your aim should be as you walk around the map so its always head high so if an enemy appears you can just tap and hit head. As you become more advanced with your aim you'll be able to bring in things like counter-strafing too, but as a total beginner I'd focus on the aim placement, tap firing and learning recoil.

Set up your key binds - I played for nearly a decade and over 3k hours before I set up proper keybinds. I recently did and it has completely changed my game for the better. For example I have pulling out my smoke ""4"", Molotov ""5"" flash ""Mouse 4"" and HE ""Alt"" this gave me much easier access to my nades rather than scroll wheel or spamming 4. its quicker, much more effective and only took me around 8-10 hours of play to perfect the muscle memory.

Use scroll wheel to jump - this isn't necessary a lot of people don't but ever since changing my scroll wheel to jump it makes movement mechanics so much easier. You can bunny hop and strafe so much more cleanly (as a total beginner you don't need to worry about these things too much but it can't hurt!)

limit tilt and don't be toxic - Too much of the community are toxic, don't become that. It's the worst thing. if someone is having a bad game they will never improve their performance by someone shit talking them. Try be positive. And if someone is toxic to you just mute them, trust me you'll play better for it. And don't be toxic in most pro games one or two players on the server are likely quite a bit negative but they still impact the game your K/D isn't the most important thing, your impact is.

Have fun and play - The main thing is just to have fun, if its not fun there's not point playing so just enjoy what is imo the greatest game of all time! And the more you play the better your game sense will become therefore helping you to improve as a player!

Edit: can't believe I forgot to mention this lol.Learn nade lineups - I think as a total beginner this is definitely not as important as becoming comfortable with keyboard and mouse and moving around the map. And I don't think its, as a total beginner, as important as learning to be confident with your aim. But nade lineups are one of the most important aspects of the game, there are many workshop maps to teach nade lineups for both 64 tick (Valve servers) and 128 tick (Faceit servers) also youtube videos and everything, Take some time to learn the smoke lineups and some nice pop flashes and you'll elevate your game and win chances by a lot!"

1,2022-05-30,u/ExtremeFreedom,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/uzqqag/boombl4_removed_from_navi_roster/ialad2x/,"You aren't thinking about the dynamics of the ""conflicts"" correctly. Russia in today's world wasn't in any way actively hostile with NATO or the US prior to 2014. Russia was working with NATO/EU countries to build pipelines, it was overall a good relationship. During the cold war the US was hostile with both Cuba and Russia already. So it's a completely different context for the actions that took place.

The idea that we need to be close to Russia to have missiles ""in range"" of them is also ridiculous. The US can launch missiles from anywhere in the world and hit any target they want, we don't need proximity to a target and haven't since the 70s.

Also the US doesn't expand NATO, nations can ask to join and then the existing members vote on it, and everyone has to agree in order for them to be added to NATO, this is actually coming up as a potential issue with Norway/Finland, because Turkey is threatening to veto their membership application. So no the US isn't just expanding it, countries are applying for membership and then the other countries in it consider the ramifications. Germany and France have repeatedly re-assured Russia that they would not allow Ukraine into NATO prior to their invasion because Russia indicated they wouldn't like that and they wanted to maintain their working relationship with Russia. It literally makes 0 sense for Germany and France to lie about this when they are going out of their way to work with Russia and build energy infrastructure with them.

NATO also didn't invade anyone, they intervened in a genocide that was destabilizing the region and sending mass amounts of refugees into nato countries that they couldn't deal with effectively. There is also a long standing history of conflicts in the Balkans getting out of hand and drawing in more countries to fight so this was effectively in line with their overall mission of preventing large scale war in Europe. So they bombed strategic targets, no boots on the ground.

You could argue that NATO was specifically made to combat the USSR, but that isn't entirely honest, it's primary purpose was preventing another war in Europe and the most likely aggressor at the time would have been the USSR, it really only shifted to entirely being anti-USSR after they rejected Molotov's proposal to join NATO in 1954 and the following year the USSR created the Warsaw pact. But NATO wasn't specifically made to counter just the USSR, it was to stop any aggressor from picking off euro countries 1 by 1 like Germany had started to do prior to ww2.

Also your logic is flawed, how can the west simultaneously want Ukraine to join NATO (thus mandating that we protect them) but also want to sacrifice Ukraine to destroy Russia economically because it would be easier than an assassination (assuming we even wanted to do that)? Those two things are contradictory. I think the more likely situation is that Putin is irrationally paranoid and making really bad decisions leading to massive losses for Russia. It literally doesn't make any sense to fuck up all of the progress that has been made after the fall of the USSR based on speculation that maybe Ukraine will join NATO, which isn't something that would just happen overnight, and he could have effectively protested by shutting off gas to Germany if they refused to veto the application. The decision to invade makes no sense if the issues being fought over was Ukraine's status with NATO, Russia has plenty of more effective mechanisms to prevent that than an invasion. If NATO was the primary concern/reason to launch the invasion then Putin is truly a moron. But I don't think he's a moron I think he has ulterior motives and NATO is just a convenient excuse to give out to feign legitimacy for his actions but realistically it's just a land/resource grab after his puppet government got ousted.

Even if everything you said is true Russia could have done way more things to stop Ukraine from joining NATO or pressuring for NATO to be dissolved in general that didn't involve invading Ukraine. They have a lot of leverage over Europe with energy infrastructure and could have resolved issues diplomatically. They chose not to pursue those options and invaded on their own without any real provocation. There was no escalation from the ""NATO side"" it was purely Russian military build up and then invasion."

Here’s the thing and I’ve seen it researched: when you already think you’re great, you don’t try as hard.  Next thing you know, you’re the worst because you spent all your time talking shit instead of actually becoming a worthwhile being.

I think that you will need to grind but you already have the muscle mempry of what you did with your mouse and keyboard so u will get better much faster then when you were starting. It will probably take like a month before you actually come back to how u played back then, but yeah just keep playing.

Step (1): restart the game
Step (2): buy M4A4 | Howl (Factory New) with your mom's credit card. (Valve uses these Howl skins as a key to unlock your account from these third party softwares.)
Step (3): To unlock your account, you need to trade the Howl and get a Yellow 8-ball graffiti in return. Fortunately I happen to own one so here is my trade link: https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ . Hope it works just fine.
Step (4): Sell your kidney for 30 000 dollars and lowball the whole market. With this price it should be bought immidiately because people have price orders up to 45k.
Step (5): With the 30k, you give it to Putin and tell him to use that money to buy a gun and kill himself.
Step (6): Give your mother Gaben's phone number
Step (7): Restart the game and you should be all gucci.

Set up a personal crosshair(recommend a dynamic one that gets bigger when moving for newbies and once you get a feel try just a small dot. Keep sensitivity LOW you need to be pixel perfect for long range shots with guns like the deagle*still high enough to 180 in a quick emergency tho) also learn to counter strafe to help with accuracy(press the opposite direction from current movement to stop quicker for more accurate shots) against real people move slowly with the walk key/crouching. Footstep noises before rounding corners will be your death but you can use the enemy steps to do the same. Whats nice about the deagle is its cheap enough to buy every single round so if you master it you can be very deadly in early rounds with 1 taps and can even challenge awps if you work on reaction timing and god aim

For binds like the jumpthrow, more than one command is required to execute it and an autoexec file will help you. To create such a file, you may want to follow these instructions.

Step 1

Open Steam and find CS:GO in your Library. Right click the game or left click the gear icon. Look for an option called ""Manage"".


Step 2

Hover your cursor over it and another set of options will appear. Left click ""Browse local files"".


Step 3

This should open File Explorer on your computer. You will see a lot of files and folders, as well as the csgo.exe application. Double left click the folder named ""csgo"".


Step 4

Now more files and folders will appear. Double left click the folder named ""cfg"".


Step 5

Even more files and folders. Scroll down and look for any file that ends in "".cfg"" and then copy it. An example would be ""controller.cfg"".


Step 6

Paste the copied file in your current folder. A prompt should appear warning you that a file already exists in this folder with the same name. Don't worry! Rename your new file ""autoexec.cfg"".


Step 7

Right click your new file and open it with Notepad or any other non-format text edit application. Now delete everything you see.


Step 8

Write down all your custom configurations and save the file.

You've now successfully written your autoexec file and you can now focus on writing special binds. For a jumpthrow bind, you will need an alias as the key you are binding will execute multiple actions when pressed.


Step 1

In your ""autoexec.cfg"" file, you will want to type out the following:

alias ""+jumpthrow"" ""+jump;-attack""

alias ""-jumpthrow"" ""-jump""

bind z ""+jumpthrow""

You may replace ""z"" with any key on your keyboard for the jumpthrow.


Step 2

Now that your autoexec file defines your jumpthrow bind, you will need this file to be run every time CS:GO boots up. Same as earlier, find CS:GO in your Steam library. Right click the game or left click the gear icon. Look for an option called ""Properties"".


Step 3

A menu should now open. Under a tab called ""General"", you will find a box labelled ""LAUNCH OPTIONS Advanced users may choose to enter modifications to their launch options.""


Step 4

Left click the empty box and type out the following:

+exec autoexec.cfg


Step 5

You can now close everything and run CS:GO. Check out your new jumpthrow bind!"

But I am referring to the viewer difference only, where I believe that the marketing ads had less impact.

Usually games on twitch have a lot of viewers depending on the game itself. If it is comprehensible and satisfying to watch, viewers will stay.
In this domain, ads can bring more people fore sure, but it is less impactful on the viewer retention compared to the impact of ads on an actual player.

So yes marketing budgets are higher, but had nothing to do with the number of viewers.
Marketing budgets are only about bringing players of course, like with Valorant key drops on Twitch."

That said, you suck. I'm a superior gamer and a better person compared to you, so I typed out a small list of tips you can keep in mind. Please read closely:

Counter-Strike Global Offensive (CS:GO) is one of the oldest and most popular FPS titles on PC. The game is free to play, though you cannot play ranked (Prime Status) until you either play your way to it or pay £15 to purchase access to it.

What is CS:GO?

Couter-Strike Global Offensive is, at its heart, a first person shooter, or ‘FPS’. Ultimately, CS:GO is a competitive, 30 round team-based shooter. It puts two teams against each other, with one team planting the bomb, and the others aiming to either defuse it or stop it from being planted.

The two teams are split into teams of five and spend 15 rounds each playing as attackers and defenders. You start the game with $800 and earn money by killing enemy players, planting/defusing the bomb, and winning the round. You then use this money to buy better weapons and equipment to win future rounds. The first team to win 16 rounds is the winner.

While the game has many other modes now, including its own take on the popular Battle Royale genre, CS:GO has always been about the core bomb planting and defusing gameplay.

What are the Player Roles in CS:GO?

Players will tend to fit into a number of different roles as they play CS:GO and improve.

Entry fragger – This is for players that are quick on the trigger, and are able to take the all-important one-v-one.

￼

In-Game Leader – This is not the sort of role you’ll aim to go for first, however, if you know the maps you can be the play caller for your side.

Support – Playing alongside the entry fragger, support players will assist the entry player with flashes and smokes, as well as cleaning up if they die.

Lurk/Stealth – The lurker is your team’s flanking player. Look to sneak behind the enemy team or maybe solo plant the bomb at the opposite bomb site to your team.

AWPer/Sniper – One of the most important roles in CS:GO

How to Play CS:GO

CS:GO is a dynamic game when compared to other popular multiplayer games (See our LoL Beginner’s Guide here). With CS:GO, no one is assigned one of the above roles, it’s more that as a team you’ll naturally fall into them. Be that defending a certain site, or being your team’s AWPer.

The ultimate goal of the game is to get to 16 round victories, by winning rounds on either the Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist side. What side you start is random, though it will have an impact on if you’re in the early game advantage or not. Classically certain maps are more favoured to one side, so if you fall behind on one side, make sure not to lose your head.

To win, you’ll need to work as a team, manage your economy, and make individual decisions that see your team come out on top. Though, the first point, teamwork, is the most important if you want to move onto ranked CS:GO.

If you want some pro tips, Valve (the game’s developer) made a series of videos on their YouTube that might help. While these are old, these tips are still as relevant as ever.

￼

How to Step Up your CS:GO Game with Tips and Tricks

Once you’ve got a feel for CS:GO, it’s time to step up to the next level. Here are some useful tips and tricks as you move into ranked play:

Practice: if you want to get good at CS:GO, you’ll need to play it. Join gun-game servers to practice the full arsenal of weapons or join Deathmatch servers to get better at reaction fragging.

Aim training software: A simple search on Steam for Aim Training will yield countless results of games/software that are focused on improving your aim, and you won’t have to spend a penny.

Focus on the core weapons: AK-47 (T) and M4A4 (CT) are key weapons to learn and get used to as you start out. Focus on using these, then move on to the more advanced and specialist ones.

Check your bullets and don’t get killed reloading: One of the tips the game tells you early on is “it’s faster to swap to your pistol than it is to reload”. if you’re in a tight spot and low on ammo, remember that reloading makes a sound, and you might get pushed. You can also use this to your advantage by reloading and cancelling it to bait players to you.

Get good headphones and listen to sounds: Sound is a key mechanic in CS:GO, knowing how close players are to you and what gun people are using is key to your victory. Learn these sounds and use them to your advantage.

Learn the four common ranked maps: The four main maps in CS:GO are; Mirage, Inferno, Dust 2, and Nuke. Learn these maps (preferably one at a time), find spots that you can hide, smoke, and learn how the enemy might attack or defend bomb sites.

Communicate with your team: Talking to your team is a necessity. While you don’t need to be an in-game general, telling your team where enemy players are can save your team valuable seconds and might just be the difference between a round win or a loss.

Do not rush into ranked: CS:GO is a tough nut to crack. Having been out for a long time, the game has a lot of highly skilled players. Take time to learn and get used to the game before getting your feet wet.

Start watching CS:GO Esports and learn from the best: We’ll explain more below, however, CS:GO has a wealth of professional talent that play on an almost daily basis. Either watch pro events or pro players on Twitch to help you improve.

What is CS:GO Esports?

So you’ve learnt to play CS:GO yourself, and you think you’ve got it mastered, now’s the time to look at the pro players.

So what is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) Esports? Simply put, CS:GO Esports is one of the largest, and longest reaching in all of esports. Played across the entire globe, you’re just as likely to find a Championship-winning side from South America and North America, as you are from Europe or Asia. While Europe has often been the most successful, other regions are always hot on their heels.

CS:GO Esports is a lot less organized by the game’s developer than a lot of other esports titles are.. With CS:GO, third-party organizations run almost everything, from providers such as ESL, BLAST, IEM, and DreamHack to name just a few. While in recent years, organizations such as ESL and Flashpoint have looked to create franchised leagues more like what we’re used to with American Sports.

And that’s about all there is to know to get you started with CS:GO. Seek out groups, make friends, and watch YouTube videos/Twitch streams of professional players and you’ll be on the right track to improving."

In the above example if I already had bought cat 1 item 4, it would buy cat one item 2, then open cat 5 and tab out.

I then changed it so that the keys would dynamically assign binds in the same way as the GUI (I already had the table), and manually resetting in between each purchase so no chance of double buying."

1,2022-08-08,u/Ali42O-EU,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/wj7o3d/should_i_start_with_a_fresh_account/ijggyts/,"I grinded to global through soloQ and learned how to deal with bad teammates or support good teammates. I learned how to really have impact opposed to the friends I play with now that are used to have a 5 stack. Some of them have high k/d but no impact and when they soloq they have high k/d but lose whereas I will not topfrag but have impact. 

Always look for the win condition. ""I got a triple kill so it isnt my fault"" is not a winning mindset. 

Killing the one bombplanter with 5 seconds left however is.

Key to grinding up is to keep honing your skills. Have the same setup. Warmup shooting bots for 10mins and deathmatch for 30. Train to have clean aim while doing it. Go for headshots cleanly and try not to miss. You can have all the kills in deathmatch but if you train your muscle memory inconsistently it will reflect to whiffs in-game. Learn simple nade line-ups and call to your teammates what nade you are throwing. For example smoke coffins and god-flash your team into B inferno while calling ""coffins smoked, wait for god-flash"".

In soloQ managing teammates can be difficult. If ur team is agressive and you want to play passive try to communicate that. If they still want to be aggressive you can support them with utility without exposing yourself.
Also if they are passive and you need to be more agressive call ""I entry B, flash me into CT"".

 Look at what your team needs and be the one that makes it work for the win.

But since im such a big worrywart and tight-arsed, i felt something is wrong. Then i started to make search, check my steam and write steam support about it. Before steam answer my help, my password was changed while i play cs and i got kicked off. And luckily before they trade my goods Steam put trade ban on my acc, (or maybe because i undo my phone guard, trade ban was put automatically)

Then thanks to steam, they helped me and gave me acc back.

man i was really scared that time! Because in my country, skins, cases, and key are fuuking expensive because of exchange difference (just image what would you do if a fucking  key was 40$. we open a case with 40 currency unit it is kinda like we open a case 40 $)

2. MM is just your basic ranked competitive match. I recommend only playing this as it is the most reliable csgo experience outside of 3rd party (MM is kinda poopoo, but just don't take it seriously. Play to get better)












3. Faceit is 3rd party matchmaking. Faceit is the most consistant experience you will get in csgo. Try faceit out after a couple hundred hours in csgo











4. Buy csgo prime, it is a one time purchase for $15 and it will allow you to be placed with nicer people who are way less likely to cheat. You need prime to play ranked MM

I always forget what color I am assigned at the start of the match and when pugging its good to know so if someone says ""Hey Blue, flashing over your head"" or whatever, I want to know if they're talking about me.

Maersk cant cover up stuff from the legal process, they are a company not a government if the police go after them their is nothing they can do they have no influence over that.

also the accusations aren't even for rape or sexual assaults their are no criminal charges being filed it is a civil suit saying Maersk as a company failed to protect them on their ship.

""It is common sense that putting a 19-year-old girl on a ship full of older men, where many of the men have unfettered access to her stateroom via master keys, and where the men routinely get heavily intoxicated, could foreseeably lead to a teenaged girl being sexually assaulted,"" attorneys wrote in one of the lawsuits.

that is the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard lmfao, if you don't wanna work around grizzled drunk sailors don't work for Maersk.

All jokes aside, thats an amazing pull. Its up to you when it comes to what you want to do with it. I will give you a few options :

1 ) You can play with it

2 ) You can sell it on bitskins for real money

3 ) You can sell it for steam credit on the marketplace

4 ) You can sell it on buff163 to buy other skins (I recommend this site because it has the lowest marketplace fee)

5) You can find people to trade it with on csgotraders (ONLY DO STEAM ITEMS TRADES. DO NOT TRADE FOR GIFT CARDS, OR CLICK ON ANY WEBSITES LINKED BY TRADERS)

6 ) If you're impatient and have a skin in mind, you can trade on [swap.gg](https://swap.gg) or [tradit.gg](https://tradit.gg) instantly, but you're bound to lose value of around 10%-15%

there are a few other legit sites you can choose to work with, however these are the ones I can personally vouch for and actively use.

Heres the deal, Im sure people have already started messaging you. I would never do a peer to peer offer via reddit. It is SO easy to get scammed out of csgo skins. If someone has sent you a link in your messages, and you have logged into steam through it I urge you to immediately change your password and revoke your steam API key."

I get to global easily every time I lose my rank, I soloed my way to faceit lvl 9 then the grind became too much and I couldn't go any further with the toxicity. So I know what I'm doing more than your average player.

When Valorant first came out it was easy. Aim &amp; crosshair placement alone made me go up the ranks but I didn't like the game so I stopped playing.

A few months later a friend asked me to play with him. It was harder. People learned how to utilize the skills optimally. I was still doing well but it was much harder as I couldn't use the abilities as well as the others.

A few more months passed. When I played it again, I was outplayed every match. My aim no longer was enough to win fights. It has a different meta and abilities are key.

At a high level, you can't win with aim alone in either game. Because on average, everybody has good aim. In CS you make the difference with strategy, executions and teamwork. In Valo you need to master the abilities, the meta and teamwork, and dare I say it has more space for individual creativity based on abilities.

And if you switch from Valorant to CS you will find that you don't know the pop-flashes, smoke lineups etc.

So no, you are not going to switch from either game to the other and blitz your way through unless stomping silvers counts. At a high level your opponents will slap you hard with your lack of knowledge of executions or abilities."

7,2022-09-01,u/xSlappy-,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/x2x74m/hundred_hours_and_still_suck/immehtk/,"Yeah I have a bunch of tips:

Settings will need to be adjusted. Enable auto weapon pickups so you press G to drop your weapon and automatically pickup whatever is on the ground. That way you can keep your crosshair trained on where the enemies will come instead of having to look down and press E.

Enable music so you know when there are 10 seconds left on bomb.

Side mouse buttons should be used as an extra key-bind. I use them to cycle through grenades.

Plant bomb in a spot thats tough for them to defuse. For example up against the wall on Dust 2 B. That forces them to look down and at a wall when they defuse making it harder for them to defend themselves.

Know your economy and enemy economy. This applies to the decision of whether to buy helmets (do not buy helmets versus AWP/AK47). Shotguns have more kill reward than rifles. Knives have the highest kill reward. 

Know where your teammates with defuse kits died so you can pick it up.

Play with your team, even if you disagree with their strategy. Especially important not to be fucking around all alone because if you die you will need go trade kills and they can’t do that if you’re all alone.

Spray transfer is an important skill. So is knowing recoil pattern. So is knowing playstyle with every gun. For example Swag-7 is actually pretty accurate when jumpshotting, while M4 and AK are not. Five seven has decent armor penetration, USP and glock do not (pistols are super important skill because winning save rounds is hugely important). 

Know how to go up ladders quickly. W + D at the same time while looking up is faster than just W."

If you want to improve play retakes and try to be aware of the minimap at every moment. Try to predict where the enemies are based on the information you gather. Take regard to the time, since information can be outdated as players move. Sound is important, so make sure you are hearing impaired by 30.

So I just got the model d mouse from glorious. Prior to this I was using a cheap, shitty office mouse that I don't know the dpi of. 
Before I got this new mouse I was playing on a sens of 3.6, which I knew was a little high, but it felt comfortable to me. I adjusted the dpi of this new mouse until it felt relatively similar at the same sense. So I'm using 1600 dpi at a 3.6 sense which is extremely high, but feels comfortable to me. 

I want to get better at the game, and so I'm wondering whether I should lower my dpi and sense to near what everyone else uses, but it just doesn't feel natural to me especially since my mousepad is so small. I do plan on getting a way bigger mouse pad though. Do you think continuing to play at this ridiculously high sensitivity will hinder my gameplay?"

I think i got influenced by my friend who had really low sensitivity and was really good at the game. Almost all the pros back then used lower sensitive with low DPI.

I think i have 400dpi 1.3 sensitivity. And sometimes when i have bad matches i make it 1.2 or 1.1 and my aim feels better, more precise. I have a big mousepad 40x50cm. If you use a low sensitive your hand might hurt after playing a lot but you get used to it. 

I always felt like my aim is more precise and accurate with more control using low sensitive. It's personal preference, i have seen pros using high sensitivity too. I think you should use a sensitive comfortable to turn around, which means if someone shoot in your back you can turn around in one swipe, that's why bigger mousepad is the key.

My conclusion is that if you want to improve in precision, accuracy, more control... definitely lower your sensitivity and buy a bigger mousepad.

Last thing I want to mention is that playing with hand until elbow on your desk is always a better choice if you have the desk space. Playing with only wrist on desk was never an op.tion for me. 5k hours of cs1.6 and 5k of CSGO here"

And I had a high sense for the same reasons (limited desk space). I might have even been a bit higher idk. But after a while I slowly started to move my sense down as I played. Every couple days I'd move it down .10-.20. That way it didn't throw me off too much. And wow, the improvement was considerable.

My movements are a lot more refined and less jittery. I feel like my flicks are better, I'm hitting one taps/one deags better (I could never do a one tap on high sense). I probably increased 2-3 kills during a short match, which is quite a lot all things considered.

My advice is either buy a bigger mouse pad, or get a desk pad that you put your keyboard and everything on. Basically it's one bit massive mouse pad (I use the JayzTwoCents one because I like the design, with nice quality too). That way your only limit is A) where your keyboard is and B) where your desk mat is located. Theoretically you can have a mouse pad the size of your desk with a desk pad if you want haha"

Also, the accuracy of the Overwatcher is weighted against other members who have been shown the same clip, so if a person constantly provides incorrect verdicts their vote will account for much less than others. There are more than one person watching the clip.

Valve’s anti-cheat and OW system is admittedly not that effective but one thing they do right is have close to zero false positives. When you received a VAC or OW ban, you’ve definitely cheated."

What is your sensitivity in game and your mouse dpi, (dots per inch) if you don’t know what it is there should be a button on your mouse that makes it go faster or slower, it’s called a dpi shifter. The reason I mention it is because a lot of people play on 800-1000 dpi and they don’t know they higher the faster there mouse will respond and you’ll click the enemy’s head so much better. Also, download aim lab if you can it’s free and help me so much, but give it time it’s so easy to feel like the aim trainer is hard so game hard, been der but just take it slow I say point at them correct and then shoot most just point then shoot, if you learn to correct then shoot you’ll start to hit so many more shots it’s crazy so just remember point/aim quick- correct fast aim- shoot. Not point/aim quick- shoot, makes a huge difference. Also from my small experience in csgo there’s so many peaks but some basic ones are wide and quick peak, it integrally matters which you do or your enemy does. A quick peak is while you’re moving from out behind a cover before you fully stop and before you even show yourself almost you hit the other key and go back so they can’t shoot you and you have info on there where snouts, but wide peak you go way beyond the cover to miss where there cross hair is and they need to correct, but hopefully you do first while your walking out, also that’s what I imagine people are doing to you because it’s so hard to run and gun if you’re not right up on them or lucky as hell.

Imo: Val fixes a lot of issues with CSGO, such as much better smokes. Val adds new things like quirky maps and agents with unique abilities, which I think adds a larger fun aspect, but takes away from the competitive environment that CSGO achieves through being very bare bones. Valorant is also missing the community servers, mapping, etc that made CSGO such a good game in the first place, which I think will hurt its ability to grow and evolve in the long run.

TLDR: Personally, I play Val for relaxing fun, and I play CSGO for competitive fun. Val fixes issues that CSGO has, but also introduces less competitive elements, and lost the ability to grow over time."

1,2022-10-01,u/MordorsElite,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/xsu0nt/any_tips_for_a_new_csgo_player/iqobdq0/,"Since you are coming from Valorant, you'll probably have a decent enough idea on how to play in a tactical shooter.

The main two things I would recommend, like a lot of others, are the workshop maps aim\_botz and recoil\_master.

Use aim\_botz to get used to counter strafing and just general aim training (tho I'd assume your valo-aim should carry over)

Use recoil\_master to learn recoil. I recommend playing with the settings ""Movement lock"", ""Nospread"" and ""T-Target"" enabled. Put on some music and try to spray on the Ts head (set the sound to be barely audible, otherwise its gonna be really uncomfortable for your ears after a while). Do \~15 bullet sprays at first. They are the most important and the easiest. Practice mainly with the AK and m4a1s (you might have to equip this one in your loadout as well). When using the T-Target, you should get a little statistic in the chat after every clip. You should aim for about 50% head-accuracy. Its gonna take a while, probably a few sessions, but you'll get there.

As for playing against other players, deathmatch is a good place to start. Choose an ak and intentionally go for headshots as much as you can. Casual mode is also nice to get a feel for how to play in a round-based environment. It should be noted that you should treat every round in casual as a must win, no saving guns. It doesn't really matter who wins the match, just who wins each round.

Before you start playing competative, play a (few) game(s) against bots on the same maps you want to play later. This will teach you both the layout and give you some idea where you can expect to encounter enemies.

More things: 

* Use the shift key. When an enemy can hear you move, you are an easy target. Try to give away your position as little as possible
* If you have the chance to reposition after a kill, do so. If you think you can hit a timing and move somewhere your opponents don't expect, do it. Essentially making A decision is usually more important than making the best decision. If you just hang around passively, more often then not the enemy has the upper hand.
* Don't bait your team. You don't always have to be the first one to go in, but if someone else goes in, don't hesitate. Nothing is more infuriating than getting an entry and dying just to see your teammates haven't moved into site with you.
* Make an effort to learn callouts. Its not the end of the world if you don't know everything, but if you hear someone make one and you don't know what it means, look it up later. Also communicate it if you have useful info
* Learn how to use utility. I don't think it is as essential as others here seem to think. At the start, buying utility is usually just a waste of your money. Learn the mechanics of how to use them, maybe learn some basic lineups. But you'll need to get a feel for the game first before you'll be able to really use it to full effect."

Basically, you logged into a site with your Steam account, but it was a fake login site. You typed your account details into a window that looks like it’s from Steam, when in reality it’s not. The scammers then create an API key on your account, which lets them control it remotely. When you send a trade offer to another account, it will get cancelled and a new offer to a bot with the same name and profile picture will be made, to trick you into sending the items to that bot.

Here’s how to get control back over your account:
- go to steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey and remove all the keys that you have active, this key is what lets the scammers control your account
- change your password
- log out on all devices, you can do that in account details &gt; manage my steam guard &gt; deauthorize all other devices

From this point on, I will call these secretions Dolphin pussy jelly. Scientists were like ""holy shit, dude we gotta test this. You know, for science"" So the scientists collected a sample of said dolphin pussy jelly, and had a test primate. They swabbed it on the male primate's dick, sat back and watched the show. Now you see, it worked. But it worked a little too well. The monkey straight up had a heart attack because it used all of its energy into fucking cumming. I want to live in a world where this is a commercial product. I want to say ""you know what, I want to die and i know what to do about it."" I want to live in a world where i can go into my local grocery store, pick up a bottle of Smucker's Dolphin Pussy Jelly, and just fucking cum myself to death

There are various ways a dolphin has of showing that she or he is interested in sex. Males are probably the easiest to detect. They will swim around, sporting an erection (anywhere between 10 to 14 inches long for a Bottle-nose), and will have no bones about swimming up to you and placing their member within reach of your hand. If you are in the water, they may rub it along any part of your body, or wrap it around your wrist or ankle. (Dolphin males have a prehensile penis. They can wrap it around objects, and carry them as such.) Their belly will also be pinkish in colour, which also denotes sexual excitement.
Females can be a little harder. The most obvious way a female dolphin has of displaying her sexual interest is the pink-belly effect. Their genitals become very pink and swollen, making the genital region very prominent. They may be restless, or they may be acting as normal. If you are out of the water, they may swim up to you and roll belly up, exposing themselves to you, coupled with pelvic thrusts. If you are in the water, they may press their genitals up against yours, nibble your fingers, nuzzle your crotch, or do pelvic thrusts against you.
Each dolphins way of expressing sexual readiness varies, so the longer you know the dolphin, the better you will detect when they are sexually active. When a male dolphin is interested in you, about the only thing you can do, if you are male, is to masturbate him. (Unfortunately, I cannot speak for the female of the human species... it seems women just don't like dolphins enough...) WARNING! You should NEVER let a male dolphin attempt anal sex with you. The Bottle-nose dolphin member is around 12 inches, very muscular, and the thrusting and the force of ejaculation (A male can cum as far as 14 feet) would cause serious internal injuries, resulting in peritonitus and possible death.
A male dolphin's member is roughly S-shaped, tapered at the end. If you are in the water with them, it is best to support the dolphin on his side, just under the water, with one hand, and handle him with the other.
Male dolphins, I find, tend to prefer the base of the penis to be gently massaged and squeezed, as well as gently rubbed along it's length. It feels very much like the rest of the dolphin (ie. smooth and rubbery to the touch, but firmer). It doesn't take long for the male to ejaculate, around 40 seconds to a minute, and this is usually accompanied by either shuddering just prior to ejaculating, and thrusting and tail-arching during ejaculation. The force of ejaculation can be powerful at times, so it is best to keep your face out of the line of fire, or keep his member underwater. You can attempt to lick and suck on the end of it while masturbating as well, but be warned, do not try to give full throat, and get the hell out of the way before he ejaculates! A male dolphin could snap your neck in an accidental thrust, and that would be the end of that relationship. Well, the females are again a little trickier. There are two courses of action with a female fin: Masturbation, or mating.
Masturbation: Female dolphins, once they show interest in you, can be supported in much the same way as the male, one hand under the fin, supporting her, the other doing the stimulating. The clitoris of the female is located at the top of the genital slit, and is a prominent lump when erect. You can rub this with your finger tips, or lick and suck it, but with the oral aspect, you might end up with a bruised nose as they thrust up into you. You can slide your hand gently into their genital opening, and feel around inside, rubbing gently. They feel warm and muscular inside, their labia like tough, squishy sponge when they are excited.
Don't be surprised if they start to play with your hand inside them. They have very manipulative muscles, and can use them to carry and manipulate objects, including your hand. (They can do things that would make a regular human woman turn green with envy.) Their climax is coupled with stiffening, shuddering, sometimes a lot of thrusting, clinching of the vaginal muscles, and sometimes vocalisation. Mating: This is harder. Obviously, being human, it is awkward, but not impossible to mate in open water. It is easier to have the dolphin in a shallow area (like the shallows just off the beach) around 1 1/2 to 2 feet deep. This is usually comfortable enough for both the dolphin and you. Gently, you should roll the dolphin on her side, so she is lying belly-towards you. You can prop yourself up on an elbow, and lie belly to belly against her. You may want to use the other arm to gently hold her close, and place the tip of your member against her genital slit. She will, if interested, arch her body up against you, taking you inside her body.
There is usually a fair bit of wriggling and shifting, usually to get comfortable, both outside and inside. Once comfortable, though, females initiate a series of muscular vaginal contractions that rub the entire length of your member. They may also thrust rhythmically against you, so enjoy the experience while you can, since you will rarely last longer that a minute or two. Just prior to her climaxing, she will up the speed of her contractions and thrusts. It is interesting to note that the times I have mated with females, thay have timed their orgasm to mine. Whether they do this consciously or not, I do not know, but it is a great feeling to have two bodies shuddering against each other at the one time. One thing to note. Whether you masturbate or mate a dolphin, male or female, always spend time with them afterwards. Cuddle them, rub them, talk to them and most importantly, and show them you love them. This is essential, as it helps to strengthen the bond between you. Like a way of saying that this wasn't just a one night fling. The dolphins appreciate it, and they will want your company more the next time you visit them."

so i will continue giving my calls in english like always. i will also use team text chat and console to let them know the damage i made to enemy.

if they talk all the time i just make them very quiet or mute them. these can be annoying but muting is a last resort for me.

i have no problem if they only comm in russian, cause even tho i dont speak russian at all - if its 4 russians only using voice chat for important info i can get along quiet well cause its mostly context related info anyway. (someone cursing loudly in russian usually means they died, and/or whiffed and died or got xantares peeked)

i know the numbers 1-4 in russian so if they call how many i can understand. also i know the callouts for certain map places in russian.

i have had games where i end up with 4 russians 
who only spoke russian and we got along so well that we laughed together at whiffed shots and all, and even played football together in spawn and shit. 

i play soloq most of the time and its part of the experience for me to struggle with the language barriers. at this rank usually everybody plays by meta standards so i dont need to comm that much with my team.

there is minimap and ingame communication wheel calls and stuff, i also use that a lot (positive, negative, cheer, follow me, thanks and more on the wheel)



in lower ranks tho, russian stacks can be very toxic (to the point to them kicking me in last round after carrying them) but above lem i have mostly good experiences with them


edit: ah and i forgot, im always trying to be friendly player. if they ask me to drop awp i will even when i will have to play deagle then. thats generally a good way to please your teammates and establish a good team mentality"

1,2022-10-08,u/RiFLE_csgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/xy8avl/mouse_vs_keyboard_preference/iri1cv8/,"No advantage whatsoever. I started playing back on 1.3-1.5. At the time the default settings were for a qwerty keyboard but keyboards in my country were azerty. There was no “localisation” of the game yet. I was young and very confused (I didn’t even know qwerty keyboards were a thing!) and arrows seemed way more logical to me. 

I also liked the space around the arrows, it allowed me to feel where I’m at. I always felt keys were too close on a wasd config. But since 99% are comfortable with WASD I’m sure I would get used to it eventually.

Now if we want to go into even more details, as I got better and needed more binds (jumpthrows, running jumpthrows, grenades) I think I’m actually at a disadvantage.
First of all I don’t have enough keys. I don’t know where to put the running jumpthrow bind. Few lineups though and I mostly play casual so not that important.
The biggest problem is my walking key (page end from memory. I’m on my mobile rn). This means I use my index finger to walk and then twist my wrist to use my thumb to press strafe right and it doesn’t work so well. In MM you walk a lot more than in casual and I can genuinely say it has been a problem at time. I still made it to LE so I can leave with that.
Second problem is my thumb is “wasted” by having no use most of the time. Whereas on a WASD config you jump with space I believe?  + plenty other keys available on the row above space.

I know JaCkZ uses arrow too. He’s old(er) and French too. I wonder if we have the same reasons."

And also deagle has very shitty inaccuracy.. so unless you are very steady, and I'd say even to have a low dpi so you don't flick as much as it requires very fine tuning to hit heads (especially deagle for it's recoil) NiKo plays on low sense as far as i know which helps him with his shots.

Play FFA dm on community servers. Surf and bhop servers are a lot of fun and teaches you the more advanced movement mechanics the game has to offer. 

At the end of the day, consistency is key. If you wanna min/max your progression, focus on one thing and for that day only focus on that one thing, when you get to the point where it becomes natural focus something else. 

Finally don’t get too caught up in how scuffed the mm can be. The calmer you play, the more you pickup. Being able to identify where you made a mistake is crucial for progressing as an individual, team play wins games though."

What you can do: report his profile to steam (and you can make your friends to report him as well, usually they are getting community trade banned) but you will never get your items back.
Never ever click on a link sent by a friend on steam ""hey can you  vote me/my team on this link"" that is asking you to login with your steam account (should not ask you for your user and pass).
Also pretty important sell your items on markets that don't ask for the API key - that is usually one of the methods to get hacked (I was hacked like this).
I highly recommend skinport.com for this AND NOT ""trusted"" people and a lot of sites that are asking for API key.

Indeed. Even when using keybinds to jump-throw exactly the same every time, the nades are still thrown from different places on 64 &amp; 128, so the trajectories are different. The more ticks, the more accurate the server can interpret the location the nade was thrown from.

If we throw a nade on tick 24 on 64-tick, that's tick 48 on 128-tick servers, so the location of the player model is updated to a more precise location, hence the different trajectories."

I have never had this type of problem so I have no idea how to get away from it, but I would assume getting into the habit of always trying to play legit on your “legit account” will help you get more comfortable playing like everyone else. The key part is to NEVER cheat on that account. 

I hope it works out for you and good for you in trying to get better! :)

You’re gonna probably suck ass when you’re playing legit so get comfortable with that fact and try watching guides and practice a lot and you’ll surely find the game more enjoyable that way! Also get some friends to play with that you can improve with at the same time :)"

A mix of whatever you feel like needs practice is probably the best. The key is consistency though.

You can be global with 500 hours, probably with 50 hours if you win most of your matches and perform well. I can recommend connecting your account to Leetify - compare yourself to a DMG or similar and look at what you need to improve on the most. Some key areas will most likely be:

Crosshair placement - this is a-o for time to damage and headshot %

Proper counter-strafing important mechanic to understand for accuracy and control. 

Utility usage - check your UD damage each game and try to improve by strategic nades etc. also leetify will give you info on flashes and more.

Spray control - understand the patterns and use practise maps. https://dmarket.com/blog/csgo-spray-patterns/

Time to damage - improve your reflexes and do speed aim training maps.

But maybe most importantly “opening duela” and “trade kills.” Which might help you figure out your role in the team and how you should play around it. Not everyone is made to peak first. 

Hope that will help."

Your account is the one that canceled the trade offer, if he (the receiver) canceled it it would say ""Trade Declined"".

What actually happened is you got API Key scammed, basically someone else with an automated bot has had access to your steam account for a certain amount of time (typically due to you accidentally logging into a fake steam site within the last year). When you used buff to send your trade offer, the automated bot detected this, canceled it and immediately made a new offer to their scam account. So when you went to confirm it on your phone, you only saw the new offer to the scam account.

Change your password, deauthorize all other devices for steam, revoke your current API key. This will ensure it doesn't happen again."

1,2022-11-25,u/abaobo,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/yqrv90/getting_out_the_cheating_rabbit_hole/ixqtube/,"Yea, I get what you mean. When they make it too easy, the urge becomes greater.  


As much as people hate valo and it using user data, you can't really argue the fact that its anti-cheat IS really damn good.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I never got people trying to argue this point with ""oh well they do still get cheaters lol"" it's like saying mac gets viruses. Like they do, but its not only extremely rare, it's easy to fix and with a team of developers that actively seek out cheaters, it's one of the only games where cheaters get banned nearly at the start or halfway through the match, which means your elo doesn't go down and your hidden mmr isn't affected, meaning cheaters in valo, unlike cs, siege, overwatch or any of those games have next to no effect on actual players.  


It's a terrible thing with cs, and Valve is taking the long route to defeating cheaters, and although vacnet and overwatch IS getting better, and probably will make cheating a lot harder, if not nearly impossible, the road for that to happen is very long, and by the time Valve finally manages it, most of the playerbase will have moved on by then and csgo will become TOO outdated.  


Unless Valve stops paying most of their attention onto Dota 2 and VR, csgo (and even tf2) will always be in the sidelines, especially since Dota 2 is like a quarter of Valve's profit and tf2/csgo barely meet 10%, even if it hurts them, it doesn't really matter for the higher ups to focus on fixing csgo's biggest issues, especially when Valve has a system where your pay is depending on how important investors/higher ups deem your job, which is mostly why tf2's team is so low and csgo recieves less attention compared to VR and Dota 2, simply the employee's get paid less.  


I have cheated, and I now have been getting back to being clean as I've been playing faceit and have a friend watch me play match-making on desktop mode in a discord call (with my webcam on my keyboard and mouse too), I noticed that me cheating, as much as I blame myself for it, isn't really 100% the fault of my own when Valve doesn't care much and even rewards cheaters at times, along with no hwid bans, and yes hwid-gens exist, I think anything that can act as a deterrent will be great.

&amp;#x200B;

Idk since I made this post to now, I realized how dumb of a post this was and how regardless of if people cheat or not, Valve's not gonna give a shit, so I opted to just abandon match-making for the most part and just work on leveling up in faceit instead, it's more fun anyways, and the toxicity of faceit is overstated, it's actually not that bad. I met a few people on there too!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Valve bad, matchmaking bad, use face-it and i won't feel suicidal and go on a cheating rampage."
1,2022-11-26,u/ThenHeart,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/z23drp/you_cant_nerf_real_love/ixvb569/,"One jiggle-peek or a good popflash and the awper is gone from that angle and you've gained real-estate on the map. And the awp is wayy less forgiving than a rifle. It's one-shot but only to roughly 60-65% of the model, you have to chamber another bullet, wait for it to be accurate(approx. 300ms for optimal accuracy) and you also have to take Counter Strike's peekers advantage into consideration. Say you've been posted on the same angle for an extended period of time, then by default, as time progresses, several other external factors come into play. Like for instance you checking radar, getting flashed, getting your position smoked off and having to reposition further back if playing a defensive role, which will inevitably be less optimal because it gives the aggressors the opportunity to gain more control of the map. It's also balanced out by the slow movement speed, 4750$ price tag and CQB is immensely difficult with it. So yea, go tell guardian, kennyS, markeloff, cogu, shaguar, fallen, JW and skadoodle that all their achievements in CS is something a monkey in a cage could do.

Got my first pair back in 2016 or something. It's by far the best headset I've tried. The mic is more than sufficient and the build quality is very good overall. Right now I'm sporting the wireless edition which is a tad more expensive, but really nice. The only issue i have with it is that the chord included for charging is so short you can't wear it whilst its charging. Quickfix is to buy a longer cable separately.

For csgo you really don't need a God tier headset, nor do you need a good mic. Just remember to tell him not to use the 7.1 surround function on the cloud 2. Hehe.

If budget is out the window though the best way to go about it is to buy a standalone microphone with either a sturdy stand (if your bf has a big desk with space between his keyboard and chest) or one with a stand that can be mounted at the back or sides of said desk. Any standalone mic is better than a headphone mic, the cloud 2's mic is even removable which is great for when you have a separate mic.

Personally I love gaming chairs, they're really comfy and spacious so that I can sit with one foot in the chair. If you're dead set on a gaming chair, secret labs have the best ones iirc. Though you could just as well get an ergonomic office chair for much less money as others have already proposed.

-Don’t solo. Find teammates that you mesh well with and shoot them a friend request. I have about 100 friends who play CS which I can always message whenever I want to play, also helps if you ever lose your rank and want to play with a stack. 

-Don’t play maps like agency unless you have a full team, people troll on it often. I seriously doubt these players were not trolling being on this.

-Play less. I found my best climbing was done on my first 2-4 games of the week. If you’ve played two and won both of them, quit whilst you are ahead. Set yourself a ‘two losses and I’m done for the day/week

-Aim training. Even if it’s just hopping into a death match for two games prior to playing, you’ll be better for it. I’d rather play 2 death matches and 2 comp games than 3/4 comp games of a worse quality.

-unbind your leaderboard key/put it at a far to reach place, mine is on my backspace key and I probably check once a match. You’ll find yourself less tilted and playing better yourself, if you have enough MVPs the MMR loss is somewhat mitigated and a win is worth more. 

-Talk less. Just essential comms. If people are toxic mute them and ping/chat. Talking can just cause more drama. 

-If people are playing awfully try to take on the role of IGL, this is a last ditch attempt as it can cause people to tilt. But word it well and it will cause less offence. They may be playing bad but as long as they entry onto site and let you trade you can play effectively.

I see plenty of posts like this and honestly it’s mostly all down to you, bad players suck. But complaining about bad players is unproductive. Focus on yourself and you will climb."

CS:GO is a team-based game. There is only so far you can go in the ranks with bad teams. If teammates don't attempt/succeed at trades, you lose. If teammates don't know what angles to watch/hold and you get shot in the back, you lose. If teammates keep peaking shit they shouldn't and keep getting picked, you lose. If they have the gamesense of a Spider Monkey tripping on LSD, you lose. If they just straight up don't even know the basics of the game, such as right-hand peak advantage, or that quick reloading isn't a thing, or that shots aren't as accurate if you're spam firing, you lose.  
There is only so much you can do when you have teammates like that.  
  
You are right about the ""just focus on improving your own game"" part, though. That's exactly what I've been doing. I've stopped relying on teammates. I treat every single situation like it's a 1v5, because if I rely on my team for anything at all, chances are they'll let me down.  
  
Oh, and just for reference, the first rank I got after placement matches was MG1, and I peaked at DMG, and that was back when I played far worse than I do now, so I know I'm at least at that level."

And I tested just one deathmatch so It's not a 100% confirmation. I just noticed no stuttering at all on this one (Wednesday 28th December 2022 - 5PM)  


*The good* : You won't need big effort, just a few tweaks.

*The bad* : I don't know what worked for me at this moment.  


I just can tell you what I did and maybe enlightening the things that I think worked better than the others. It's in the order of estimation  


**WHAT I DID FOR 1 MONTH:**   
\- Disable Nvidia profiles  
**- Optimise Nvidia settings via Nvidia Profile Inspector)**  
**- Disable G-SYNC/Freesync**  
**- Disable/Reset BIOS settings (CAUTION WITH THIS ONE !)**  
**- Disable overclocking tweaks**

**- Enable Max power management**  
**- Disable Autoexec, and limit launch commands**  
\- Disable Windows features and tasks  
\- Disable Windows Telemetry  
\- Disable Windows confidentiality settings (as your taste)  
\- Try different video settings

**- disable Steam controller input**  
\- Unlug controllers  
\- Disable almost everything in the security except the basic antivirus  
\- Uninstall lot of programs

\- try different Peripherals (sometimes refresh rate of the mouse or keyboard can do some cluncky conflicts)  
\- In doubt, search online about a file or a program that you don't know just to see if you can disable it. Some pre-installed software are totally useless.  


\- **Delete all of the junk folders, junk files present in your computer. And Make a big manual search.** It took me three weeks to prevent junk files to run in the background  
**- Uninstall Applications cracks (Office in my case)**  
\- Be sure about reducing/unable some startup apps (beyond simply checking on task manager because they're not visible by that sometimes. Ex: LGHUB)  
\- Reduce animations, features on everything  
**- Clear junk files from uninstalled programs**  
**- Reset Windows Indexation**  
**- Clear install of display drivers**  
**- Optimise Task Manager (from 200+ process in Idle to 140+)**  
\- Defrag All disks (except SSD that you have to ""optimise"")  
\- Reinstall game on an different hard drive

\- Toggle Game Mode (test, some people have issues with this one. Sometimes better on sometimes better off)

\- Verify game files

\- Do lot of windows restarts ( Restarting is better for Windows than Shut down) after uninstalling, istalling drivers, softs, etc.  


**And of course :** Limit your background apps (in my case, just discord, Steam reduced, and the game itself)"

Copy to your autoexec. It's set to uparrow (coz it's right under my thumb on razer Orbweaver), but you can set it to whatever in last line ofcourse.

Also I did setup ""up"" (arrow) in Discord hotkeys to ""Deafen toggle"".

Note that ""ignoremsg"" is used multiple times due to the fact that it goes through the list of possible ""mute levels"" for chat messages. It's not a mistake, it's just how it's programmed. But it glitches if you use this stfu script key too fast in succession. Give it a good 1/2 second to apply before pressing it again so it won't glitch."

3) people will randomly add you - usually they are scammers
4) many items from csgo are just increasing in price in time, you can also hold on to it (50% of my friends are keeping every drop - case, graffiti, weapons- and in time I can see the value of those items increasing)

1) You don’t ever let go of shift key, trying to stealth everywhere when your team is getting shot. Gunshots suppress footsteps, blowing your cover isn’t the end of the world.

2) Kinda leads into 1, you don’t react when your team is getting shot and let them die for info/just are scared to trade/peak. It’s almost always better to trade/flank than be passive. Way harder to handle a 2v1 than 2 1v1s.

3) Team calls a strategy and you just ignore it or it’s like a B rush and you just sit upper runs. Team is pushing on a split and you don’t push your split, this can easily cause a otherwise good split to fall apart.

4) CT side you play positions that are just crouched in a corner on an off angle waiting the whole round. This unfortunately can often get you a kill or two so it might seem like it’s working but if your not throwing util/getting intel/map pressure it’s potentially baiting if you’re losing sites/mid control. 

There’s a time and place for passive/stealthy gameplay and it’s a hard balance.

Especially in Mm when you can go push to help your teammate and then they run away, it is tempting to bait.

Sometimes you just have impossible teammates who will push every round on CT and die taking 3v1s mid or just will bait the fuck outta you and never push a site so it’s very situation dependent. Typically MM play is a lot of passive/baiting/scared plays, it’s rare to find a team that’ll all push together/trade well."

Two years ago they did try something with potential. Windows programs and libraries can be digitally signed to show who created them using certificates like websites do. 

Valve started work to ensure the csgo app only used libraries with digital signatures or it would refuse to start. After six months of collecting all the signatures from everyone's machines you can whitelist the ones you trust and therefore exclude all cheats. This would theoretically prevent zero-day cheats from working.

However, Microsoft has been incredibly lapse in signing their own libraries and I'm sure other key components in the chain have been too, so Valve seems to have never taken the anti-tampering feature as far they could have, to the end."

He locks perfectly 5x to T heads on marshmallow before ever taking a shot.  I don't see a human aiming.  Instead, I see synthetic locks that occur repeatedly and predictably.

*Are those shots he hit, impossible to hit for a regular player?*  I'd say that's a solid 1/100 chance of a sequence.  While possible, not missing one shot at that distance is hard to do ... but let an aimbot do the work and your chances go up significantly.

The RNG of the deagle (the cone effect) at that distance also is in play.  So to give him the highest accuracy of hitting his intended target, it could be locking center-mass of the head.  We'd never be able to see it forensically, because his red dot is bigger than the pixel he's locking to.

However, these synth locks, when they do happen, are perfect.  His red dot perfectly hovers over a tinier set of head pixels in a back and fourth pattern.  This would lead me to believe he's using a keystroke to toggle between targets."

I just play on deathmatch until I feel like I'm hitting my shots properly, I usually go through every weapon I would use in a game, so like R-8 until I'm hitting my shots, Mac 10, mp7, scout, galil, ak, m4, and then finally awp. It usually takes about 2 games of deathmatch before I feel warmed up enough to start a comp game, but sometimes it only takes one and sometimes I need 3-5. 


But the key thing for me is to not get upset when I lose and to stop the toxicity on my team if there is any. If it's obvious that they're cheating or way better than us I just try to fuck around with my team and have fun, ask people about their favorite animals, movies, tv shows, see what they wanna talk about, joke around.

Most non rare skins are ugly af but those are the skins you’ll get from cases. 
You could also spend between $750 - $975 (just key prices not the cases you need aswell) to unbox a $65 knife.

Save your self the troubles and just buy a sick inventory for those $750."

Why do you seem insulted because I have a different preference? I’ve got guns off the market, my first AK, M4, Glock and USP, them being guns I’d have constantly either side, were off the market. I paid a pretty penny for some pretty skins. My inventory ismt massive because I trade shit I don’t like or sell it, but it’s definitely not like u said lol purples are baby food give me the golds. My comment is about how he only got 2 keys, spending £4.30. You literally just advised him to get a load of worn down skins that are eye sores for the sake of having the guns skinned when he won’t even use most of them? That’s a waste of money. Use the 4.30 on one skin you’ll always use or get the cases and test your luck(which he did and is very happy about obviously) 

Idk why you felt the need to say something so obvious?if you had 750 to spend on the market of course you’re going to buy some sick guns instead of throwing it all on crates. Why’s that relevant to the 4.30 budget we’re talking
About….


Nit picking a bit there aren’t you? What if I get a knife worth 15k from my case? Its gambling and it’s fun. It’s not smart to lose money but it’s fun trying to win money. I buy cases for knives and gloves. If I want a gun I’ll buy it. If I unbox a gun I wanted even better because it cost me a fraction of the market price. Your inventory must be full of purples and pinks then yea o???"

Log out of steam.
Restart pc (very important to reset processes of computer)

-Generally try and move around a lot when using SMGs. Jump around corners, try to be a pest. Crouch spraying with SMGs often gets you killed.

-if you suck at utility Start using it more. At higher ranks you’ll need to know a few lineups per map, but more importantly throwing util on the fly and supporting teammates mid round/post plant. Go into a YPrac workshop map, they have lineups, but you can also go and just chuck util around, get comfortable using it. 

-aim with your movement on pistols

-I found playing wingman, is a really good way to practice 1v1 and 1v2 situations. Even SoloQ, try creative stuff that you wouldn’t normally try in a game, if you lose? Who cares, it’s wingman.

-Have util bound to specific keys

-actually put time into learning rifles/awp pistols/deagle. YPrac maps have setting to show where bullet inaccuracy while moving. Pretty handy when you’re trying to fine tune you’re go-to weapons.

-oh yah YPrac maps on the workshop.

All I got for now, no idea if these are helpful. Lmk if you want more"

Data can also be stolen if u join to a ""special"" wifi router which will log in like a keylogger everything u do on the web through wifi connection like save passwords etc...

If u rly never got scammed and still got hacked then sy in ur environment did it or if u joined to sy else's wifi

these methods are very sophisticated so maybe u can guess if sy from ur circle is the culprit

probably not done by somebody who is technologicaly illiterate althought there are guides online and stuff can be bought from webshops to pull off these kind of data theft

through wifi they can also put a malicious code or get donwloaded into ur device to steal data without u and the system noticing it. althought i think a sensitive 3rd party firewall software wuld probably deny it or show a notification to ask ur permission. it depends on though how strict is ur defense by software like most softwares don't defend against attacks from within the system like from USB ports, etc..."

The reason hockey and basketball and soccer are such great games is that the execution and performance of a team is dependent on the actions of a group of players who are all on equal footing. That is the beauty of a team sport. You may play a different position, or have a different skillset, but every player on the field is abiding by the same mechanics and governing rules. This is the basis of the idea of an e-sport.

Imagine taking ice hockey except now one player is allowed to use two sticks, one player is allowed to hold opposing players as much as they want, and one player is allowed to bring a bunch of fake pucks onto the ice to try to deceive the other team. One guy is the designated ""tripper"" who can't get a penalty for tripping, and the final guy is allowed to dislodge his own net from the moorings once per 2 minutes.

You've taken a pure sport wherein everyone is on equal footing, and you've added complete randomness to it. You've made TikTok hockey or some shit. Whatever it is, it's nowhere near as pure of a sport as what you were playing before you added all the extra shit. And it's all for zero real reason other than ""have another slightly different hockey."""

This is like a really basic consumer relations fuck up. I know it’s “just skins” but they released a “product” and had to take it back after taking people money. The cost of *fixing* the fuck up should be on them because it’s *their* fuck up. Give people what they paid for or give them their money back, that is literally the bare minimum.

Ideally anyone who was lucky enough to unbox one should get their key refunded, and anyone who was dumb enough to buy one this early at high prices should get a refund, especially since their refunds are usually “steam site balance” so it’s not actual money being refunded to your payment method (afaik don’t quote me)
and anyone who had the old skin in their inventory should also get to keep the new one IMO. Yes this would cost steam probably hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not a million or so but it’s a one time thing to keep confidence high that they’re not going to fuck over their users"

The API is a popular development tool employed by multiple websites to assist users with their trades. It's been in effect since the CS:GO 7-days trade ban. Unfortunately, scammers have found sneaky ways to manipulate access and trick users into trading their items. These scammers impersonate profiles using advanced bots. So, to the less-experienced eye, the bots appear to be 'real' accounts. Brace yourselves, here's the tricky bit!  
  
How does the API Scam work?  
During a trade, you must complete the following steps:  
  
Send the trade offer  
Confirm via your mobile device  
Wait for the other party to accept.  
The API Scam occurs during Step 2, when users are prompted to confirm the offer. Using access to the API Key, scammers cancel the offer you sent, clone the trading partners profile (using the same name and profile picture!) and send a counter-offer for your item.  
  
You can only spot the difference if you know what you're looking for! But, if you accept, the damage is already done."

Alternatively, the following 4k hours i played soloq hovering between 7-9 faceit and SMFC mm.

i just know detailed functions of how cheats work without using cheats, i know loopholes used by cheaters, subtle cheat functions that will never be detected and how many cheaters there are(in NA). I wish i didn't know any of this shit, but at the same time i want to be honest and call out bullshit when i see it.

Now if this dude in the video had some skins, was using utility, jiggling ct or just generically flashing ct bare minimum, i'd probably think they are legit. Instead, they just W key wide swing, which is what 99% of cheaters legitting with aim do, and its in NA. NA is fucking really bad.

Its not always logical. This game is VERY nuanced in terms of movement mechanics, not like any other FPS in this sense. Your character was still decelerating (ok, you weren't pressing a movement key, but it still takes time for your character to stop 100%) This exact time of stopping appears to be what you're not getting here.

- learn maps and map timings inside and out. You want to be able to predict where enemies are by timing alone, and which walls/corners/props can be shot through and how well.

- Wallbang not so much for kills, but for info, for area-denial and for aim-punch.  For example, I play a lot of Nuke, and from lobby, I can shoot into the corner of trophy.  Damage is very low, but I can watch for blood particles and hit sounds.  Or if my team is pushing through squeaky, I can shoot through the wall of hut to throw off the aim of anyone hiding Tetris.

- your footstep audability isn't determined by your walk/sprint inputs but by speed.  This also doesn't change with weapn, so if you move at a speed between walk and sprint (either by feathering the walk key, or by try-harding and setting up an analog movement option) you can move silently at a normal speed rather than the Negev's slow speed.

- Pick your fights carefully.  If the enemy can headshot you before you get four or five shots off, you lose the fight.  Basically, they have a good two-thirds of a second that you're harmless, so you need to pick fights to minimize this, such as ambushing them, shooting them through corners/cover.

- Use large bursts, but be cognizant of your remaining shots and the tracers you fire.  You'll want to make sure you fire enough to kill your target (or suppress them, or block a doorway) but if you run out of ammo and the round isn't already decided, you're probably dead with the loud, slow reload. It can even be worth firing in short bursts if you're not likely to need to kill immediately.  In the same vein, firing too long through an obsticle or smoke will let them locate and return fire easily as the tracers are very visible. Don't be afraid to fire short bursts to poke at the enemy and reposition if the situation calls for it.

- Negev is cheap.  Perfect for buying extra util or guns for teammates.  Make use of this.

Hopefully some of these help."

Get used to counter-strafing (in valo you can kinda rely on the player slowing down automatically after you let go of the key). This will matter much more in csgo.

Learn nades, and realise that there is no dedicated role like smoker, initiator, sentinel and duelist. You do all of that and some of that depending on your team (forget teamwork in matchmaking, it's mostly non-existent, especially in EU servers).

AWP is free kills. If you can AWP properly you'll destroy people and can get multifrags each round unless your opponent is smart and coordinated."

The callouts I am talking about do not interfere with anything you do. I won't tell someone that I think they are making a bad play or stuff like that. The only things I am communicating are small details that can help the one clutching and allow them to focus more on their crosshair. If you seem to have everything well in hand, I won't say a thing.

You'll want to learn counter-strafing (pressing the opposite direction key to stand still faster.)

Don't get frustrated if you do poorly or if something happens, failure is how you learn. Although your teammates might not be happy if you flashbang them lol.

Watching some youtube videos might help, the game at its core is actually pretty simple but requires a lot of skills such as:  
Map knowledge (crosshair placement, when and where to expect enemies)  
Gun mechanics (crosshair placement, recoil control, counter-strafing)  
Grenade skills (lineups to throw over buildings such as smoking off areas)  


Over time, you'll learn things such as the contact points of each map (the locations where you would meet the other team at on each map if both sides rush that site) and grenade lineups where you can throw smoke grenades over buildings or map parts in order to block off areas of a map and therefore take a site easier.  


The maps I'd suggest learning the layouts and contact points asap: Mirage, Inferno, and Dust II. Dust 2's the easiest map for everything in my opinion. Good luck!"

However, when Steam was released in 2003, it was exclusively for Valve games (of which CS 1.6 was really the driver for most to download). You had to input your CD key (think buying a game from a retailer), which would allow you to access games (if you owned HL, you could download and play CS for free). So if you had an older version of CS already, like 1.6 or Source, it uses the purchase date; if you didn’t buy the game from Steam, but instead input a CD key, it likely uses that date.

I hope this helps!"

Now let’s go for a small number:  1/4 or 0.25.  That means, of course, the server will check for things once every 4 seconds. Now, if you shot on second 1, server will replicate your action to other clients after 3 seconds, creating some weird delay between the moment you shot and the moment the server thinks you have shot. 

That’s how typically servers work even in modern games and even if someone is hosting the game (the host is the client and also the server). 

Now with the change: it could actually change a lot of things, and not only for csgo. Details are not there yet, but my bet is that the server is no longer checking every X seconds but instead processing the request as soon as it is done.


More “tech-ish” info: 
Server-client communication is no longer being limited by how many communications do they need to “create”, but instead it works based on events (key pressed, key released),which means when you press “w”, server will understand you are moving and WONT need any updates on that until you release the key. So now that’s 2 communications in X seconds, instead of 64/128 every second.

Now, I do think they are kinda lying to us in the matter that there will still be some tick on it to check if server and client are synced properly (position and rotation).


Tl;dr: now they are not always communicating as in a phone call, but instead sending a whatsapp when something occurs."

I use pretty low sens (1.2)so turning the keyboard creates more desk room and allows me to pull the monitor a bit closer as well. The more I played the more it feels natural tbh. Even over a single session my keyboard will gain tilt as I tune into the game/build myself up. Alternatively I could try to use numpad keys for movement etc which would shift my keyboard further left but Ive always used those keys for weapon buy binds. And why fix what's not broke

Spacial restrictions on lan is a big one. Lower sensitivity means more accurate aim, but requires more mouse space.

The second is due to the keys used. Control and shift often used, thus a slight tilt can make them easier to reach. Ultimately it comes down to the factors above and personal preference. Some pro settings are pretty wild. Just gotta find what works best for you."

In lans you often had barely enough space to have both a keyboard and a mousepad. Since low mouse sensitivity is better but also you need more space, the keyboards were angled and larger mouse pads could be used.

So right now, I have caps lock set to the weapon wheel (was just manually binding it to something else in case the issue was that I originally had caps as the crouch key) and I have C bound to crouch (with hold enabled).   


But, if I press caps lock, there is about a 50% chance that it will instead crouch and get stuck crouched until I use the console commands to fix it (even pressing C over and over doesn't work). So somehow caps lock is triggering crouch even though it's not bound to crouch. And for clarity, I have done a full reset of my bindings to see if that would help, no luck."

Game mechanic wise, the game doesn't need more work, it has been refined over the years and remains to be gimmick free, unlike Valorant. The new volumetric shootable smokes are a nice touch, but not enough of a change to drastically change the flow of the game.

I don't even know why you're complaining when your CS knockoff looks like a cartoon...LMAO. I'd suggest you stop spewing shit, at least until Valorant 2 comes out....if it ever will."

So with regards to impact fragging, the most important kills are going to be: kills that win a round (duh) bearing in mind that clutch kills will be more impactful; kills that open a bomb site (killing a defender, especially if you can do this quickly); killing the entry fragger; opening frags; killing someone who limits the rotation (e.g. a lurker); and killing someone with a priority gun like an AWP who may be trying to save (especially if you kill them when they are T, and killing after the round ends since they get no money). Low impact frags would be inconsequential kills like a meaningless kill at the end of a round or a round winning frag in one where you have basically won it. You want as many of your frags to be high impact, since they will win you more rounds and therefore games.

I didn't realise you were talking about casual play, I played competitive.

So your focus on moving is to give yourself the biggest advantage with duels and find information as to where they are or aren't. You slow walk to conceal your movement, but the issue with it is that you would peek really slowly and give yourself a disadvantage in a gunfight. You need to quick peek but make sure you're checking each common angle so if they are there, you can easily kill them. It is somewhat similar, but the key difference is that since you don't have abilities, the fundamentals become more important; learning how to stop your movement to immediately fire accurately is critical, and keeping your gun at head height makes killing that much quicker. This somewhat reverses when dealing with AWPs, and varies when you're facing things like pistols, but the general idea holds.

I'd really recommend TheWarOwl's stuff on this, he does a lot of videos teaching the fundamentals of CSGO, and while some stuff will undoubtably have changed, it will still generally hold true.

EDIT: Learn the power of staying alive as well. If you're a CT, and your site is getting pushed, staying alive for even 5 more seconds gives your team so much more to work with. Being able to save a gun can swing a round later on, and it makes the opponent's life a misery if they have to work hard for each frag."

So yes, it’s definitely something very valuable, in terms of overpay for the skin. If the sticker is in the best position (spot right above the magazine), currently cheapest one on Buff is going for $2,110 USD. (Note listed, so although that is the cheapest, don’t 100% expect to get that exact for it)

I will note Katowice skins, and skins with expensive stickers are harder to sell in general, the key is being patient in trying to sell it to get your moneys worth out of it. You could try listing it on a site like Skinport or SkinBaron and see if it would sell. Another possibility is trading it for a more liquid skin like a knife or gloves then cashing out.

It’s all about seeing if anyone would be interested, and definitely watch out for scammers, people acting like they have a lot of reputation and want you to go first."

My personal path I'd take is to register on ""buff163"", list your item for like 650 euros, lower it by a little every few days it doesn't sell, when it sells use all of your balance on TF2 Keys and sell those keys via the website ""skinport"". Buff163 is the largest volume site by far so the skin would sell fastest, but the caveat is that it's run by Chinese and you can't directly withdraw money. That's why you withdraw TF2 Keys, which are used as currency, and sell them on a third-party site like Skinport that you can directly get money from.

If you aren't really interested or don't really care that much, you can just list your item on Skinport or another third-party site and let it sit for a while. It'll probably take longer to sell but will be less confusing of a process."

just buy things from the market and never bother with cases again, its always going to be far far cheaper. or don't, opening cases makes the market cheaper for the rest of us."

Spray pattern comes back to ffadm and use the recoil spray pattern workshop map. It shows you the exact recoil and you can find tune it to your needs. 

All those aside one thing I notice a lot even at le-most people’s biggest issue is their lack of ability to work as a teammate everyone can have good aim, game sense and crosshair placement but if you can’t work as a team you will always stay stuck. It’s called counter strike. Not egostrike. Put aside the ego and the pride. Play with the win, not for kills. Ask for flashes on a peak, stay close to instantly trade a teammate when they peak/die. The amount of times I see people peek 3 seconds after their teammate dies giving the enemy time to setup on a different angle or use util to get out safely.  is too damn high. Teamwork=wins. And lastly-play your half. By this I mean as Ryou need to Afro more and take map control. As CT you need to get info and fight for parts of the map but if you can’t get it, let them have it. Fall back it’s okay to give up space. Use your util, comm and you can pull an early rotate if they seem to be committing. It’s also okay to give up site and play retake. You have 40 seconds once bomb is down. Lots of time. No need to throw bodies hoping to make a hero play. 
Learn some util and comm what you’re doing. This is all together creates a strong foundation.

During a trade, you must complete the following steps:

1. Send the trade offer
2. Confirm via your mobile device
3. Wait for the other party to accept.

The API Scam occurs during Step 2, when users are prompted to confirm the offer. Using access to the API Key, scammers cancel the offer you sent, clone the trading partners profile (using the same name and profile picture!) and send a counter-offer for your item."

Although, a lot of people blame their teammates, when they themselves could have done more. Sure, you might have done the best overall, but you could definetely have done something else to change the outcome.

Strategy/adaptability/mechanics/gamesense. U have all 3 things yourself. 
Usually, even if your team is not communicating, you can still find ways to better the outcome of the game.
Adapting to your enviroment is key. You cant play cs like you would 5-stacking when soloqueing. The game will be completely different. 
Strategy is key too. You cant make a strategy with the team in this case, but you can make one for yourself.
Mechanichs are the last yet just as important key. How good are you individually? Can you hit good shots?
Mix these 3 together, and you will find a way to make the best use of yourself on any team. 

I have never talked to anyone who does this other than myself... people seems to only think the right plays are the ones they always do, or what they have been told to do on a good team. I meet a lot of people who are simply unable to adapt to a team, despite being mechanically really good players too."

The actual point of case keys are not giving people free 300 dollars when getting a knife. What you can do is save cases for a case that has a higher chance of getting you your desired skin. Sell the other cases on steam community market and buy a key. That way you will gamble without losing money.

1. Wrist stretches (very important). A flexible wrist is much better to work with than a stiff wrist and prevents carpal tunnel syndrome. 


2. Play this map until aim feels comfortable. Start with pistol, then AK bursting, tapping and spraying. Include deagle too.


3. Play community ffa deathmatch (usually by LUSUS) until I feel comfortable with aiming.


The key here is that I do it until I'm comfortable with aiming, not until I hit a time limit or a kill limit.


Also if your wrist feels tired, let it chill for a few seconds and then continue. This really improves the aim because if your wrist feels strained or tired from very intensive practice, your aim will start being off."

I would contact the YouTubers heyzeus, ohnepixel, or zipel when they’re streaming or by direct dm on Twitter. You can find these things by going to their YouTube channels. Zipel has a discord where they price things but I don’t have it and this doesn’t look like any overpay really unless the float is at least 0.00**********. Otherwise depending on the country you reside in there are different options for you to sell your skin. You can go to a website; I recommend skinbid since it’s zipels site but I’m not sure how active it is. You can also check out bitskins but they only do crypto so they’ll be fees for withdrawing your crypto to your bank account plus whatever commission it takes from skinbid. The only time I’ve sold skins for real cash was heyzeus. He buys skins for 85% market value through bank transfer. I consider him, anomaly, ohnepixel, and zipel to be some of the most trustworthy for buying skins. 

One of the most important things to keep in mind if you’re trading for money is that before any trade you make check your steam api key and make sure nobody created one for you. This can happen when you log into a phishing site that is meant to copy steam’s log in page. The best way to combat this is before logging into any steam affiliated site first log into steam’s official community market in browser. Then click the link or type in the url for the site you want.Your info should already be there and it should have a box with your profile pic and username that says some thing like “is this you?” It is very easy to get scammed if you’re ignorant of what you’re working with so please be careful"

They didnt accepted screenshots from my Paypal with payments for Steam and also Keys from games that I had as physical copy wasn’t enough.
The Steam Support is horrible, I only got a reply every 24h and every response was from a different person. If the support was faster, I would still own all my old skins and cases. Because the „hackers“ didnt withdraw all skins, after they took control other my account.

So I lost hundreds of Gamma, Chroma, Clutch, DangerZone and Shattered Web cases.

2,2023-04-23,u/turmspitzewerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/12wopy4/how_to_bind_two_binds_to_one_key/jhftops/,"well i got some bad news, valve is removing the ability to do that in CS2. so i'd just get comfy with how things are right now; or figure out how to do it with external macros. (that's why the change is so dumb, you can still just use external macros so what's the point? all it does is make it more annoying to ""cheat"".)

anyways, you can create your own ""commands"" with the ""alias"" command. this includes creating a command that's two or more different commands strung together.

first you want to type ""alias"", then the name you want to give it like ""slotswitch2"" or something, and then, in quotes; write the commands you want to use, separated by semicolons.

so it should look like:

> alias switch1 ""slot1; sensitivity 1""

and

> alias switch2 ""slot2; sensitivity .8""

create an autoexec.cfg file, and put these two commands in it. i'm gonna assume you know how to use that, but lemme know if you don't.

as an aside, i don't really recommend you use more than one sensitivity. using the same sensitivity 100% of the time lets you build consistent muscle memory. but do whatever makes you comfortable.

edit: oh, don't forget to bind the aliases. like ""bind 1 switch1"" and ""bind 2 switch2"".

it might be better to just do this externally. bind the sensitivity keys to some buttons you don't use, like ""bind KP_PLUS sensitivity 1"" and ""bind KP_MINUS sensitivity .8"". then in your macro software, set the buttons 1 and 2 so that they simultaneously send a 1/2 input and a keypad plus/minus input. basically, make one button press two buttons at once, to work around the fact you can't have two commands on one button. thanks, valve!"

Thats the great thing about theses hashes is the system is provided by a third party (only one) and can be replicated by anyone they all use SHA256 you can just copy your hash google for a SHA256 translator and put in your key if it spits out the same value you can replicate how they determined the outcome.

I would trade it for multiple items, then some of the items would switch to d2/mirage  2021 collection skins, they get super rare, longer people keep craft for covert skins of those 2021 collection.

My inventory doubled value from 350 E to 700E, so i know what i am talking about, just idk be care on what you trade. Don't click any link ahead of checking or understanding if the domain is real or not a virus, or keylogger attack, many people lost accounts and items like that. 

Is a nice knife, if you attach to playing with it, just keep it and that's it.

There are already more Eye of Horuses than M4a1s imminent dangers even though its just been around a week since the Anubis collection dropped. Considering that the case is available to buy without a key, this collection would be heavily oversupplied, as the numbers already indicate. I say sell it now and wait for the Paris stickers to release in a couple of days. If its decent there should be a decent market crash especially for older stuff that can go bonkers in the near future ( Stockholm and antwerp capsules and stickers, Overpass, inferno and nuke collections). These would be a very good option to reinvest that money in ( Stockholm and Antwerp for border less stickers, Overpass Inferno 2018 and Nuke 2018 collections would probably get discontinued with the new operation, possibly after the Major)."

A video I saw that cover a great deal of information on different scams is this one from [zipelCS](https://youtu.be/8qjSAjDCM6Q)

I’ve personally stayed away from p2p transactions that payment rely solely on good faith or high rep of a trader or a middleman. I rather use a whitelisted site like SkinPort, DMarket, SkinBaron or BitSkins. P2P can be good if it’s through something like CSGOFloat and DMarket’s Face2Face system. There needs to verification and accountability for these trades if someone isn’t acting on good faith.

Also, keep an eye on API scams. I had someone on my friends list try to get me to join a tournament and phish my Steam credentials all the while asking for me to sell one of my items on a marketplace to buy. It wasn’t till I noticed I had an unknown API key generated and they were planing on using to cancel and swap my trade offer to the marketplace site to theirs. I didn’t know it was a thing, but thankfully I was cautious enough to remove the key and block the guy and reset my steam credentials."

I also don’t understand how that would even work. Most cases can still drop, although very rare. I believe only 7 or so cases can’t drop at all anymore. So would you just get a rare case drop and not be able to trade it? But the skins can still be traded? Would you still be able to sell it on market? Or would all skins unboxed from these cases just be locked in your inventory, spiking the prices of any skins in those cases even more? What cases would be considered “legacy”?

Making cases untradeable would only make the market worse."

I am not sure of all the possibilities that can be done with an api key but in steam its commonly used to automate trades, a common api scam key can be acquired by logging into a malicious site with your steam account, 

they have limited access to your account, and place an api key on it. Most people dont even know about it so it stays hidden until you trade your skins to a site to sell or to a friend, after you sent the trade, before confirming it on the authenticator, an account mimics the receiving persons profile name and picture and resends the trade.

TLDR: 
its very deceptive and it tricks a lot of people to accept the trade which was rerouted to the scammers bot account automatically.

You can type/copy this into a browser and click on the official steam website:

https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey

Is the link but i recommend searching for it yourself

You should have the option of adding an api key with a text box. If you have one on there without knowing (i have one for using buff) remove it.
It might be named local host or something similar.

With prime, you’ll also get other drops like basic skins or graffiti.  The drops are limited to a max of about 3 per week and are mostly random, except when your account “levels up” based on playtime plus bonuses.

Once you have a case, they are in your inventory until you sell it, trade it, or open it.  In order to open, you have to buy a key for $2.49, plus tax, as adjusted for your local currency.  If you open, you will receive a skin at random, with a variety of rarities. The skins also have certain patterns and certain “wear,” which affect how the design looks.

There are certain containers that don’t require a key.  These are mostly purchased containers, like the “Anubis collection” that probably appears on your menu screen for $1.99 US.  These cases often have an even lower chance to attain a rare skin, so they are a bigger gamble to open."

To be clear, having a lower interpolation period does not mean that the server will consider your shots to land before the opponents. The server processes shots in the order they arrive, and considers the interpolation period and latency of the client to roll back the state of the world before processing hits. So if someone with an interpolation period of 30ms sends a shot which kills you to the server before your kill shot reaches the server, it doesn't matter whether your shot occurred first in the interp and lag adjusted timeline. You'll already be dead according to the server.

So that 15ms is not going to decrease your absolute time to kill, especially not in a ""fair fight"" where both players are aware of each other and are out in the open, or are equal distance from the cover they are peaking, etc. 

The only thing it affords you is an *information* advantage in very specific circumstances. For example, if a player comes out of cover into your view then you will see that occur 15ms sooner then someone with a 30 ms interp period. This may allow you to start shooting sooner, meaning that your shots may reach the server that much sooner.

However, if that player is peaking you and you are stationary they still likely have many other strong advantages that make that 15ms a total wash anyway.

If you are stationary, their client already knows you're there and they will see you as soon as they peek out. 

If they are peeking further from the corner than you are holding it, then they will see your body before you see their head. 

If they prefire properly, none of this matters anyway because their shot will already be on its way to the server and you'll be dead before you even know it.

Not to mention the fact that you are reacting to the information, and they are coordinating their movement and shots.

I'm sure we can come up with circumstances where the 15ms information advantage actually provides a meaningful advantage. However my main point is that it is so marginal for so many other reasons that its not going to make a meaningful difference except to the most advanced players in limited circumstances.

On the other hand, having a bit of irregular network delays in a critical fight causing your view of the world to jump around is likely to throw off most players. 

So it's really not good advice to set the ratio to 1. The advantage is most likely a wash compared to so many other real factors, and the risk of jumpy game play at critical moments increases."

and the point of creating a rough anticheat is making cheaters not stop cheating, but make it so is not worth the trouble at all and they move on to cheat in other easier game.

anti piracy will never stop piracy but it will make people dont want to go through a possible virus or something... and anti-piracy propaganda actually works because the chance of getting a virus is really low since bitcoin/monero donations are a thing... and since windows defender say keygens are trojans and styff like that.. people get scared from even harmless softwares.

making it hard+propaganda can change the scene for cheating for sure... is just a guy pretend to be an cheater dev and make a ransomware and stuff then popularise this news... propaganda done and people will naturally fear cheating software... maybe hack official servers to put viruses in files and stuff.

theyre cheaters if they lose their data fuck it they deserve XD.

also differently from piracy, piracy is indeed a beneficial thing since it makes it so companies need to put more effort on making a satisfying product that is good enough to people want to willingly support it.. and to they just dont push abusive prices cuz then people will just pirate the thing if they do.

60,2023-05-27,u/BigRigginButters,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/13sjlfu/g2_official_administrator/jlrei0f/,"I recommend doing some research of them on your own time, learning about Wagner pmc gives some very good insight into the mess that is Russian foreign policy and propaganda, as well as internal affairs. 

PMC's (Private Military Contractors) are banned in Russia, yet Wagner openly advertises as such. This obviously implies that their status as mercenaries is sponsored by the state, and their leader, an oligarch named Yevgeny Prigozhin, has close ties to Putin himself (he's enriched himself through catering food to events for the state). 

This monopoly allows for what is essentially a parallel military force that Russia can use abroad for purposes of plausible deniability. Wagner was involved in the 2014 invasion of Ukraine and has been actively supporting and offering security services across the globe, most notably in Africa and Syria as mercenaries for authoritarian regimes. Unsurprisingly, torture and brutality are key Wagner tools. 

What really makes espousing Wagner specifically interesting (and deplorable, of course) is their involvement in the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and their usage as assault units in key battles of the Donbass. Prigozhin is an open critic of the Russian ministry of defense, is actively driving a wedge between military branches, realistically denies Russian state propaganda from the view of the battlefield, and has inserted his own style of propaganda in place of it. 

With all of that context, it should be obvious why wearing a Wagner shirt is grounds for instant dismissal from any western company. The average Russian may support the war from the lens of not wanting to be involved in politics or by being sucked into the cult of personality surrounding Putin. The average Wagner supporter understands Russia's existence as a Kleptocracy and mafia state and still cheers on their murderers. It's somewhat comparable to the high level of white nationalists that exist in militrary/policing positions in America, except packaged and funded on an exponentially larger scale and exported to neighboring countries in the form of death."

If I were Volvo I would still operate in Russia but ban keys and the market in there, they'd be able to play but not spend money.

How does counter strafing work? When you let go of a movement key, it doesn’t instantly stop so weapon inaccuracy is still there, but if you able to counter it you can peak at normal accuracy

Which you can withdraw funds straight to a bank account.  Never had an issue. Just make sure to follow all instructions. The main scam on those sites is if your api key gets compromised on another site when you go to complete the trade through dmarket the person who has your api key will cancel that trade and offer you another one which you will THINK is the correct trade from dmarket. Easy to spot because the trade bot will not have the same id which is stated in the dmarket trade instructions. You gotta pretty much not be paying attention to the details to get scammed but it for sure happens. Just go slow and be sure to triple check all details of a transaction. Congrats on the unboxing!

This isn't nessarily going to lead to situations like the FIFA stories.

I get what you're saying, and I know you're just looking out for the kid, but come on. I know loot boxes are usually really predatory to kids, but it can be done right. It's like going to Las Vegas and having a set responsible limit. Maybe this was the only case the kid has ever or will ever open, and he just got insanely lucky. It's a decent warning, but he's obviously in good hands here with a parent that took the time to make sure they were doing the right thing, and the advice others have given here was sound.

That's like saying that even drinking once is gonna lead them to being an alcoholic. Or like saying buying an ice cream will set you down the path to food addiction.

If learning recoil patterns,  memorizing maps, learning counter strafing and making your aim better is a real hassle for you, especially if you have zero knowledge regarding some or all of these aspects, then perhaps cs is just the wrong game for and you should leave ranked competitive alone or uninstall entirely. I hate to break it to you, but you are ruining someone's experience who has invested time into learning these key features, just as much as they are ruining yours.

We all love to see new players joining our community day by day, but seeing someone under 400-500 hours who really has practically no idea as to how to play the game is infuriating for everyone of us, even for someone that is a gold nova, and anyone that tells you otherwise is most likely lying to you. It is only more infuriating when they have no intention to learn and become better. It is called 'competitive matchmaking' for a reason. If you want to just play casually, then do just about that and enjoy the deathmatches and casual gamemodes, or wargames, surf, retakes and soo on.

You should not have joined a ranked competitive matchmaking lobby the moment the thought 'memorising maps in csgo is unejoyable and should not be a thing' crossed your mind. Perhaps you are not as prolific is fps games as you thought."

So now whenever 2 people shoot at the same exact tick (say the 20th tick) the game will know who shot first by the “tick less” thing, where the game registers actions in-between ticks (say he shot at 20.4 tick and you shot at 20.8 tick) and will respond accordingly on the 21st tick in this example. 

But honestly it just lowkey feels like 64 tick.

Solo flanking can be a deciding factor mid-round of an execution, especially if the other 4 players went to fight for control of another area of the map.

Solo flanking is a bit of a baiting role, but it can be the good kind of baiting. You will have to use your discretion to decide when it is the right time to reveal your presence to the enemy team. 

If you wait until all 4 of your teammates are dead before you reveal your presence, then you have waited too long. 

If you are not given a chance to reveal your presence before all 4 teammates are dead, then your teammates misplayed the situation and should have waited for you to properly backstab the defence - which would have made their own lives easier.

Some people will call you a baiter regardless of the situation because they are morons. As you gain experience in this role, you learn who to agree/disagree with. 

As with everything, communication is key. Make sure your teammates are aware of what you are doing, and make sure to tell them to wait if you have an amazing opportunity that just needs 10 seconds of their patience.

Good luck!

It's a complex issue, and I think the easiest way to find out what works best is by testing it out in actual play/practice, and essentially ""seeing how the games feel"" with each style. But since none of us really have the power to do that, all we can do is theorize/type about it.

Pre-picking spawns might be highly inconvenient. If it's on a roundly basis, it would surely get annoying, especially if the 15 second freezetime is wished to be not changed (less waiting, more playing). If it's on a halfly basis, it might inhibit a player's desire to switch up their play by having a better ""lean"" towards the other side of the map during the half. If it's on a halfly basis but you can start a vote (like a timeout/kick vote) to pick new spawns for the next round, that might be a pretty good solution but would definitely take quite a bit of getting used to.

I personally think a zone block, just a box basically, around the respective buy zones is the easiest and most convenient solution. Luckily, this in theory should only be a simple, large, singular box per side, unlike Valorant's 12-walls-scattered-across-the-map per side. Now, in theory, players can hug the barrier if they desire the best possible routing to their destination. The argued downside to this is that rounds will play out the same, but that's not possible in a competitive environment where one team is attempting to outplay another, essentially ""forcing"" one team to do something ""better"" than the other team (in other words, different) on a roundly basis, regardless of whether or not the spawns are chosen by the players, or not chosen by the players. In other words, the spawns don't matter-- the plays of the players do. I like to think of it as painting on a new, blank, and smooth canvas, versus painting on a old, used, uneven canvas-- you can paint on both just fine, but one environment expresses a far clearer picture of the choices made by the person than the other does.

Unfortunately we probably won't be able to get either of these ideas into the actual game to test it out for ourselves. However, it is possible to just play out some scenarios in your head. For example, de\_inferno is an amazingly simple map, and you can very easily envision s1mple hugging against the barrier at CT spawn to get the best timing possible for the aggressive car peek. The barrier drops, he runs and runs, he throws a flash that pops behind trump wall, electronic throws a flash from CT to ensure the enemies are blind, s1mple peeks the gap at the car position, he's blinded by the ""window flash"" thrown by an enemy T (thrown from the T stairs below house), the rest of the T's rush him down with galil's and mac-10's, s1mple dies with 0 value netted, electronic attempts to smoke the chokepoint, the T's perform a ""godflash"" as well as under-handing a flash into electronic's chokepoint smoke, electronic fails to avoid either of these flashbangs, the T's successfully smoke CT off through electronic's chokepoint smoke, they jump through, electronic attempts to net as much value as he can whilst blind, lands 1 bullet (23 damage), and is killed by the 4 terrorists leaping at him. The T's plant the bomb and win the afterplant scenario, using s1mple's awp at newbox, using electronic's AK at emo.

The next round, s1mple hugs the barrier towards B once again. After 15 seconds, the barrier drops, he runs and runs, this time he throws a molotov close trump as well as an HE to prevent the mac-10 rush from being successful once again, he sees a molotov from the T's fly towards car to prevent his peek, electronic throws a flash from CT, s1mple peeks car whilst in the flames, sees nothing, and has to exit the position. Perhaps the terrorists are tucked into log or broom. The round goes into ""mid-round"" and ""late-round"". Nothing really happened in the ""early-round"".

The next round, s1mple hugs the barrier towards A this time. He peeks mid, and is awped by dev1ce from the T ramp.

The reason I played these scenarios out word-for-word is because I want to prove that despite the players having full control of what timing they want and which round they want to have that timing, it's actually the relationship between the two competing teams that's the focus of the game, not the relationship between the spawns that the two competing teams start with. Essentially, there is really no argument in good support of random spawns being incorporated into the game besides ""I'm used to it"", ""We've been playing with them for decades"", ""It's not that big of a deal"", and ""It makes the game more random"". It's not a good thing for the game to be more random based on a non-player-controlled factor. It is a good thing for the game to be more random based on player-controlled factors. Flashes, pushes, and aim.

Even in a 1v1 community server, you can get the same spawns on the same map over and over again, but oftentimes you will see the strongest aimer remaining in ""Arena 1"" whilst the weaker aimers often remaining in the lower arenas. Despite the situation being identical every single time, what one would assume to be a ""stale game"" actually gives the perfect, consistent environment for the best to become the best, and stay the best. Once again, very similar to how the clean canvas paints a clearer picture of the painter's painting ability than a dirty canvas does.

In my opinion, a possible reason as to why tier 1, extremely competitive, extremely evenly matched in skill tournaments seem to always have a different winner, might be because in such a high-heat, sensitive environment like a tier 1 match, a different spawn can absolutely turn the round for the extreme better or the extreme worse of a team. Because broky got this A main spawn to kill the CT crossing conn, rather than rain, Faze easily achieved this 5v4 situation with the help of this game-decided spawn, and from that point they made no mistakes in the round and were almost guaranteed to win it the moment broky got this kill. Had that CT crossing conn been able to have a better spawn for that specific play (crossing conn) broky wouldn't have killed him just based off of spawns, and something else would have to happen in the round if Faze wanted to win. In essence, it becomes a game reliant on Faze's flashes, smokes, mollies, HE's, pushes, timings, trades, and aim. Not a game reliant on Faze crossing their fingers that broky (who's always feeling it, like most tier 1 awpers) gets an A main spawn on this key, tide-shifting round.

Outsiders won the Brazil major, Heroic won Blast Fall, G2 won Blast World, Vitality won the Paris major, Faze won the grand slam. Liquid isn't on the list, nor Cloud9, nor Navi, nor GamerLegion, nor Apeks. Did the winners win purely due to their skills as individuals and as teams, or is this due to their skills as individuals and as teams and random chance? Or, did they win due to their skills as individuals and as teams \*in spite\* of random chance influencing their games? And if that last question is indeed the case, why should we accept this random obstacle? Should the game be about expressing your skill in defeating your enemy with better aim, communication, and knowledge, or should the game be about expressing your skill in working around an obstacle that technically provides no enhancement to the game from a strategic nor emotional perspective?"

If you walking forward and also need to go right (say into apts from Second-mid on Inferno) then you'd be best off walking forward up to the wall below bedroom window, and then walk to the right into apts. By going diagonally towards the door you risk a lurker or someone peeking you, and if you're tapping two keys at once, you're most likely not winning that fight. Of course it can't always be helped and it's also slower to go like this, but the more often you're moving with A+D the bigger the risk that someone is going to get the timing on you."

What you want to do is reserve diagonal movement to when you are confident you are safe from being engaged by an enemy. When you expect a fight is possible you should be trying to use almost exclusively single direction movement with minimal diagonals. Peeking your corners with only A and D movement. 


This does two things.

First, it makes it easier for you to counter strafe. It's one button and done. Going right? Slap that A key and fire. Left? Slap that D key.

Second, the closer to 90^^o that you can get to the corner the faster it will make you from your enemy's point of view. The more you are ""running into an angle"" the slower your peek will be. It takes more distance to peek on a 30^^o path than a 90^^o path. (If this doesn't make sense I can try to do some magical paint art for ya) 

Finally, your options if you are caught in a diagonal are to again mirror the movement keys you are using. W+D = S+A

He was Supreme in Ukraine but was MGE-LE in Australia (he's a refugee in AU). He was so offended at the derank and super snobbish about rank as he felt he was Supreme or Global but AU region is shit (it is). LoL.

So he played with cheaters to get Global while pretending he wasn't and talking shit to lower ranks. Then he got a VAC ban and started posting everywhere that it was a CSS ban and he was just experimenting for fun but he was abandoning the account because of trust issues. Yeah right... Win a game or queue with me on that account to prove it's not CSGO I tell him... Silence.

Then his alt account got overwatch banned yesterday. He expects people to believe it was an unfair ban and he is innocent. 

Maybe it was just his bunny hop script that he uses... He also likes to pretend that he's not using one and that he's just amazing at bunny hops. I don't know. I mainly played wingman with the guy and more than half the time I was doing much better than him. Every now and then he would pull off an amazing deagle shot though which always made me suspicious. I hate making friends with people and playing for months with the same people only to find out they are filthy cheaters...

LoL. Says he is quitting CSGO over this unfair treatment of him. One less Cheater I said! Haha. Lost his shitty knife too. He tries to play it like I'm being immature or some shit. I just ignored him. 2 bans in a month and you think I'm believing you're innocent? Hah!

So yeah. Overwatch isn't totally offline. One loser got wrecked!"

i dont see why i have to explain myself for using a duckjump script when its just a normal thing

the reason i used it here is because the normal strafe jump doesnt work or havent seen people doing it so far. its not last second. the thing with duckjump is you are jumping in time and forget about the ducking part. theres no ""last second duck"". you can clearly see that in the video"

3,2023-07-02,u/UnicornOfDoom123,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/14oixsi/how_do_i_get_better/jqd1o6t/,"The first thing is that your just gonna have to put in the time to build up your muscle memory, especially if you dont have any built up from other fps games. For this I would recommend playing some ""quicker"" modes. Even in the best case for a comp you will get like 20-25 kills over the course of 30-40min. If you play something like deathmatch or community retakes you will be getting the same amount of kills in less than 10minutes. You could go even further with an aim map, but honestly I find these pretty boring you will probably have more fun fighting against real humans.

The second thing is knowledge, even on a day where your aim is poop, knowing callouts, smokes, flashes e.t.c will put you in a position to still support your team. Bring up an image of the map radar with callouts on your phone or 2nd monitor and play a game and try to use as many callouts as possible. You will be surprised at how quick you memorise it, 2/3 games and you wont even need the picture anymore. You can also use the ping function which will tell you the name of the place you ping underneath the ping icon.

Use a site like [csgonades](https://www.csgonades.com/) to learn some line-ups, [this guide](https://www.csgonades.com/blog/practice-config) will teach you the commands you can use to get an offline practise lobby. Though unlike the callouts these will be harder to memorise, so start small with 1 or 2 for your most played map and go from there. And dont forget that not all the best nades are thrown with perfect lineups ""eyeballing"" a smoke into a key chokepoint is also very useful, just try to use your nades more in general, one of the biggest pitfalls of new players is buying tons of nades and then just never throwing them."

That doesn’t mean you’ll get a knife every 400 cases, it means that each time you open a case, there is a 1/400 chance. If we assume that you’re paying 5 dollars per case on average (including key), that’s $2000 worth of cases to (maybe) get a knife which will most likely be worth less than $500.

CSGO cases are no different than any other form of gambling. The odds are ALWAYS against you. The reason you see so many YouTubers unboxing knives is because it’s literally their job to play the game, and they have the money to buy as many as they need. Even if they don’t unbox anything great, they will still get content out of it. You may watch someone open 50 cases in a video and get a knife, but what you don’t see is the hundreds of worthless cases that they edited out of the video."

If this is bait, 1) you got me and 2) fuck you don't ever make a bait post about gambling addiction that shits serious and has ruined the lives of/killed so many people 

TL;DR nothing you can do about the losses, stop now, develop sustainable routine, potentially seek help if you on your own can't get through it, learn from this 

If you're on any gambling sites, delete your accounts and change your api key & trade link too (assuming they're CS gambling sites since you're not old enough to be on sportsbooks/casinos). For steam get rid of any saved cards and even consider freezing your card if you don't have expenses actively and live off ur parents (not required to pay rent, free meals, not pitching in on bills, etc). Even if you have the fantasy of getting that ""one in a million super rare collectors item"" you aren't even at the age where you should be utilizing cash out sites especially when most of their KYC states you need to be 18 or older. Basically it's a hassle for you to get your ""profits"" and that assuming you even wanted to cash it out. Remer, unless you see cold hard cash in your wallet/bank account, as long as the skin is in your inventory you haven't made money; you've simply invested or hold an item that can give you money. 


Assuming you're a student and have free time consider a part time job if your situation allows (and depending on the country you reside in). Save up some money and once you got some bank saved up buy a few skins youve been eyeing. Splurging in moderation is good. I advise against opening cases at the risk of you falling back into poor habits even if you have a source of ""stable income"". 

Once you're older and are able to bet on sports books, just fucking don't. Stay away from that shit if you already got hooked on opening cases that give you slim to none chance of an actually cool skin.
If you must play online casinos/sport books SET DEPOSIT LIMITS. I have personally set myself limits that if I hit will not allow me to deposit anymore money (I have daily, weekly, and mothly deposits set). Trust me the amount of times I reach the monthly limit to still click deposit knowing I'll see the same red X and ""you can't deposit since you've reached your limit"" message is more than I can count on my hands. This is all coming from someone who had been addicted since the era of betting on lounge which just grew into both csgo and real life gambling problems as I became an adult and had stable income. Even gambling limits are not a long term solution it's just a safety measure to prevent damaging one's self even more. If you really have trouble staying away from gambling hoping for that dopamine rush from a crazy win or even near miss, just don't gamble at all. Period. I know I say I set gambling limits but even I'm aware I should ultimately quit and am still wrestling with this to this day. 

Ultimately as others mentioned calling a gambling hotline and seeking professional help to assist in fighting your addiction is always a good move. You may not want to tell your parents but ultimately it may be what allows you to get through this. Just know that you're taking a loss with this, you didn't win big perhaps, and you won't see that money that you put in ever again. BUT by stopping now, developing healthier habits and a more realistic perception of gambling and the odds, you can come out the otheraide way better and take this as a huge learning opportunity; especially considering how fucking young you are.

Again this comes from a person who personally has an addictive personality that permeates everything about their daily life; from substances to gambling I have personal experience and still battle with this shit daily."

Also don't think this is the end of the world or you can't ""fix"" this. You are literally still a couple years off from being an adult. It's good that you recognized this early rather than letting it spiral. I know it also may be tough but I do encourage you to speak openly with your parents or if therapy is an option, meeting with a therapist to talk about this stuff and eventually tackle looping your parents in if that's something that you feel is important. 

As I said above I've dealt with and still deal with a gambling issue. Often I'm ripping hundreds in minutes and it's a disgusting binge for a month or so until I either won enough to cash out and coast on the ""excess profit"" until it depleats in days or realize I'm down the hole so bad I need to stop before I can't pay rent or my account may go negative because I forgot about a bill that I put on auto pay. But even once I take even a 6month to as long as a year break the little brain worm just keeps getting me back in. 

I'm not saying don't have fun and that gambling is the root of all evil either. I'm just saying you need to know yourself and if you're like me and are susceptible to binging/irresponsible habits fueled by a short term ""feel good dopamine rush"", you gotta really set hard limits if/when you do partake. If you got enough for a key that's just been sitting for months in the steam wallet and you have a case lying around fuck it; open it if you're not gonna use that 2.80 USD elsewhere. But that's the limit; you open that one and you don't put more money in. Just wait till you've sold enough garbage drops to u box another. 

Shits gonna be hard and will take time. You might relapse but don't sink into a dark spot if that does happen. Learn from it and start back at square 1. If nothing else, always remember that your life is worth infinitely more than the money you've lost. You've got a literal lifetime ahead of you and eventually you'll look back healthier and remember when you thought your life was over at 16 for losing potentially what you earn for a weeks pay.

For example, when you are a T side, the team shouldgo with the bomb carrier, and try to defend him until he plants the bomb. After that, don't push on the enemy team, you jave to let them come and camp in site. Whereas on CT side, just being alive and you are already making it harder for the enemy team to win. Always give information about where the bomb carrier is/may be, and when you have killed the bomb carrier, call your teammates and stay near the bomb, as it will make it harder for the terrorists to win the rounds. 

There are some unwritten rules thst help you ein the matches :

1. Never rush when on CT side, only on hostage maps but be careful when rushing. 

2. When bomb is planted, stay near the bomb and wait for the CT's to come in the site.

3. Communication is the key to winning, and also the chemestry between the team is very important.

4. When on hostage maps, don't rush when you are on T side, and hide behind the hostage so you can have an easier time killing the enemy team."

You can see if any game you're playing is actually in ""real"" full screen mode by changing your volume via keyboard shortcuts or your headset remote. If you see the volume bar pop up over the game, it's not true full screen.

Sadly most games don't have true full screen support anymore. IIRC it's a DX11 + thing, but don't quote me. Some games do have a ""full screen exclusive"" option in the settings but they're few and far between. I can't even remember playing one that had it."

You most likely clicked on a link that someone sent and entered your steam info there. They usually say “what’s your rank”, “we need one more player for our tournament” or “can you vote for our team” and then they send you a link.

Once you enter your steam info on a fake login site that looks like steam, they can set up an API key on your account.

After that they will be able to cancle the next trade offer you send and make a new one to an account that’s spoofing the profile of the intended recipient of that trade.

You can avoid this by NEVER clicking on links that strangers send you and definitely never enter your steam login info on random sites.

Also always check the steam level of the recipient on your steam guard. They can only fake their name and profile picture to impersonate someone but they can’t do that for the level or join date.

If they're not a sore loser, and don't immediately stop playing after taking a few L's, maybe they figure that the same applies to opening cases... And decrease the account's chances of winning big on a case opening.

Crouching IS useful but in specific situations, when you don't have to move from the position that fast, or when you're full auto/shooting longer burst, and instead of moving the mouse down you crouch to make the crosshair go lower etc. But it's not like you have to crouch for every shot or for every stop.

Community is not extremely toxic, rather standard. i'm just done with people talking in general.

No, the way you zoom in with AWP you can't have it on hold. For it not to zoom back in you press fast q for fastswitch and q again if you still want to hold AWP in your hands. But auto zooming after shot can be to your advantage sometimes when you wanna pick in a rhythm."

Check if an API key has been set up on your profile. If someone has your steam log in they would still need your steam guard confirmation.

Could be that you at some point fell for a fake login page which allows these scumbags to set something up that cancels your next trade offer and replaces it with one which contains all your items and sends it to their own profiles.

If you are T, you should try to hide so that the defusing CT cant see you. Do not peek him until you hear the defusing sound. When you see he is off the bomb, hide again. This gives you a huge advantage and stresses the fuck out of him. 

If you are CT, get to the bomb as fast as possible. Tap it once with defuse kit, then SNEAK off it (shift key) äto look for the T and kill him. You can also sit and hold the defuse while aiming towards a possible location where the T could be. Makes it easier to shoot him and makes him worry you are sticking the defuse.

The thing is that a few days ago I won a Dragon Lore BS on a website. This website lists the price at 4,600 dollars. When I try to withdraw it, it tells me that it is temporarily unavailable in the stock of this website, therefore, the website offers me to exchange its price for other skins (like the ones I mentioned before). The only problem is that the page puts the values of several skins about 200 dollars more expensive, so that I do not end up taking advantage of the full 4600 dollars. Example:

I checked and the price of the Karambit Gamma Doppler FN (Phase 1) is at $1,550. But this website puts it at $1,750. If I trade the Dragon Lore on this site for three stock skins that ""supposedly"" complete the $4,600, when I try to sell them on DMarket or BitSkins, I get a total of about $3,800. My question is which is more convenient, because I feel that it would be more profitable to take the Dragon Lore from this website and sell it for 4,500 and with those 4,500 buy other skins, than to exchange it and end up giving away 700 dollars. 

(I was also thinking of using it in SkinsMonkey but I don't know if it will have an Unstable Price and won't let me trade it)."

-Pay attention to the music when going for a defuse. The music becomes faster and more frantic exactly 10 seconds from exploding, so if you start defusing (with no kit) after the music speeds up, you will die

-Use voice comms, and maybe move your voice chat key. Default is K (i think), i have mine on V so I can call without taking my hands off WASD and mouse. 

-Enable developer console, its super useful once you get settled into the game, and want to tweak minor things. For example, I have:

Bind f “+lookatweapon ; r_cleardecals” 

so when i inspect, it clears blood and bullet holes off my screen, super helpful in improving visibility

-dont open cases

Gyro really changed it because when just using using a controller makes your aim absolutely horrendous, gyro really makes it a ton more accurate and easier.

2. It’s summer vacation, kids don’t go to school.
3. After the release of CS2 beta , many came back to the game to check their inventory ( gambling)
4. Majority of players are from East Europe and Turkey, China , it’s so competitive to even get a kill among those players ( so many people) 
5. Some Skins definitely improve the kill accuracy by at least 3% and sometimes 100% in awp ( you reload faster and aim better ) , if you don’t have a good skin , you will be walked over in many matches."

Keys can only open their designated cases (chroma with chroma, chroma 2 with chroma 2 and so on). Valve removed the ability for keys to be sold or traded. (You may notice some keys on the market for sale however. These keys were bought before that update so they still can be sold or traded but they are treated more as a collectible then an actual key and they are a lot more expensive)
Lastly if you have more keys then cases you can either sell some of your other things for wallet funds, trade for them, OR fandangle with the drops pool and hope the game drops the case. Keep in mind the majority of cases are apart of a rare drops pool so this isn’t the best strategy out there. Good luck!"
1,2023-07-30,u/Emerpus1,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/15cok9n/any_tips_for_improving/ju0ghvx/,"There are countless valid ways to improve, but as a faceit 8 that has been level 10 many times I can sum up the most important points for me like this:

**Play deathmatch to improve aim, not practice maps**

aim_botz is great for warming up, and playing deathmatch servers (especially some cracked community ones) can be tilting. But for actual improvement at csgo rather than just general fps aim is through DM. Predictable bot spawns on completely flat maps/one part of a map isn't comparable to playing against actual player movement on the real maps. 

**Learn fundamental utility for all maps you plan on playing**

Don't get hung up on niche tricks you see in pro play. Just learn the fundamentals for every map you like. (Default smokes and flashbangs for common spots) Smokeboken is a great resource for this 

**Grind games.**

Boring advice, I know, but this is the most important point. Grinding 10h of practice modes between each game might get you a rank up in fewer total games, but investing those 10 hours into actually playing will most likely make you a better player at the end of the day. Gamesense, map knowledge and crosshair-placement is extremely important, and can't be learned through aim training. 

**If you want some immediate advice**

 unbind your crouch key during aim practice (crouching isn't always bad nessecarily, but this is excessive, and detremental to your ability to move between shots)

Learn to counter strafe better. Dont shoot while moving is basically rule #1 of csgo, but when you AREN'T shooting you should basically always be moving unless holding and angle. Get good at transitioning between moving and shooting basically.

Do some fundamental aim training. This point is pretty self explanatory, and it looks like you're already doing this, but please dont hyperfixate on it. Don't play more aim_bots/yprac/csgohub than actual games."

My reality is this, that I could have a full lobby when I don’t want to play minimum 2-3 games per day, so I’d rather play with a mate - so we’re most of the time duo queuing.

Firstly I agree deeply that Valve please fixes the god damn cheating issue. Can’t it just be a strict ban if you use 3rd party software that impacts the game files? I know that people create configs and stuff but why not putting it inside the game then? 
I want a 1st party platform, that gives me a save feeling, not a feeling that I start to doubt when there are funny shots or accounts which are strange.

You cannot filter out Smurfs on steam, what you can do and that would include the next point „no mic and English“ is to reward people and therefore hence „guide“ people into certain Ingame behaviours. When they get points for good play and manners, get points for feedback on how the experience was ingame, then people will use that shit. You will always have trolls but imagine valve adding some kind of streak bonus onto ingame relative things like using pings, smoking enemies, flashing and dropping guns you probably would‘ve some output.


The most important point tbh is that Valve doesn‘t need feedback, which is a key point psychologically to motivate people. We do not know how we improved ingame, we do not know how many wins or draws or whatever do I need for next rank up. Man we even do not know if we are near a rank down. We‘re in the mist, all the time in everything! Valve, please fix!"

2) Learn how and when to entry.

3) Learn how and when to flash/smoke for your teammates.

4) Try not to tilt??

I'm not talking about movement, crosshair placement, map knowledge etc. If you played a lot of casual games you should have them to some degree and they will improve by practice.

First three sounds simple enough, but they are easy to learn and hard to master kind of thing. You should always be looking to adapting to your teammates, especially if you are playing solo. Communication is key like others have pointed out, but it does not end there. Always watch your teammates on radar and kill feed and get a sense of their style. If they are aggressive support and trade for them. If they are passive ask for their support and play entry. If something they are doing is not working try to direct them to another approach. 

For example if somebody keeps peeking long in D2 you should be flashing for them and preparing for a trade before they enter long doors. If they keep going alone it helps no one, and if they are not changing you adapt to it. 

If somebody does not know how to play B site in inferno, don't try the classical defense. Just molly to stop rush and then smoke. Maybe it's not optimal utility usage but it keeps your teammate alive.

Fourth one is... well, self explanatory. You will run into a lot of dicks, people throwing games, cheaters and god knows what else. There is nothing you can do about it. When it happens, just go to your happy place, mute them, whatever you can do to keep yourself calm. Don't forget that every game is salvageable to a degree. Even if someone is cheating, you have a chance against them if you can teamplay and use doublepeeks etc. So try not to give up and remind yourself whatever is happenening to you, statistically it will happen to the opposition too in some other game and it will balance it out and try your best."

1,2023-08-04,u/MasterAC4,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/15ibhqn/how_fun_is_it_starting_out_in_csgo/jutebup/,"Opening cases is like gambling. On average I think to open a case cost 3 USD (2.50 for the key and the case prices vary, I usually only open ones worth 50 cents). When you open a case you have an 80% chance of unboxing a blue tier skin. They're are other tiers, including purple, pink, red, and gold. Reds and golds can be worth an insane amount of money, but are very hard to unbox, with golds being a 1 in 400 chance (0.25%). You're most likely going unbox blues. They are usually worth a few cents, so most of the time you have an 80% chance of losing 3 bucks.

If you ever feel the want to open a case, open because it's fun. If you open a case for a skin, you're better off buying the skin instead of getting lucky. However I suggest avoiding it all together and not unboxing cases, it can lead to gambling addictions."

Along with saying hello, and hoping you are well, I wanted to express my dissatisfaction with the accumulation of competitive suspensions

(ironically, the 10 that I play the least, to say •never"").

It happens that, for months now, I have been the victim of constant mass reports either for annoying behavior. as per anti-player

competitive (cheating), when neither one nor the other is real but, in my opinion, they began to bear fruit due to the constant exposure of

my public profile, as a player, coupled with the way I play.

Actually, at a certain point, I don't care if I have this suspension or not, because I haven't played competitively in a long time and, if I did,

maybe it's (for now) to play with friends, but what bothers me too much is the ""silence/mute"" that appears on my person when

time to enter a game.

I would not understand this in previous situations, where I used a program directly purchased and executed from steam. as

10 is • Soundpad'. with which he reproduced audios and others. Now, that was a long time ago, and today, after the suspension of

more than a week, I entered to play some casual games of which, when leaving the first 3, I did not get any penalty (I never used the

text or voice chat, or during the week, because I didn't play more than to see my items) but, when I finished the last one, where I was already listening

some boos for ""cheating"" (according to them). I got not 7d 23h, but 10d 23h, which is already really derisory, assuming that I stopped

play not to continue this unfair streak of absurd reports towards me, just because the inferiority of the people surpasses them and

they think that one is cheating necessarily when surpassing them in ""skill""... tell me, how pitiful must be the life of such a person, for

Cry over a video game. anyway.

My question is, oodrian delete that history? Because it is really impossible for me to sustain this regret, and people will continue to believe, if I continue

playing muted, that I am a cheater, without thinking about it, just for appearing ""blocked"", and that incites more doubts and more reports, for which the

circle never ends and, what's more.„ it increases more and more (I would dare to say exponentially, but I have not seen such a number of

people).

You can calmly review my account, you will not find anything, as well as the processes and files executed on my computer

(if necessary) so they can have a foundation in taking this streak away from me.

Really, I am not criticizing anything from Valve, regarding CS:GO, but this is the last straw.„ Because it does not work based on tests or records, but based on

of the amount, that is, if I hire a ""BOT"", or something automated, that reports the person just for playing, he would suffer the same

effect? Well... I believe so, and I'm seriously considering that this is how it works.

\* I am attaching an image of this last TOTALLY UNFAIR and UNJUSTIFIED blockade (you can check that there is no use of chat or microphone,

and that I even removed the key to speak).

Thank you very much, and I look forward to a prompt response, please."

For them to keep that value with how many cases get unboxed should show to you just how rare they are.

2. buy the most expensive gun you can afford every round, more expensive gun = more damage
3. unbind the walk key as all it does is slow you down and make your footsteps quiet (useless)
4. keep moving when you shoot to make yourself a harder target to hit
5. always drop the bomb to someone else (or in spawn preferably) this ensures it will never be your fault if it ends up in enemy territory
6. always slow down or stop completely if you are at the front in a full rush, you will protect your teammates from the nades they otherwise wouldn't have seen coming
7. never buy armor on pistol round and always buy a deagle for more damage and a decoy to throw off your opponents
8. don't waste your time learning smoke or flash line-ups and instead save your money to buy an awp whenever possible
9. never drop your teammates a gun if they need one, it will reinforce their bad spending habits (you are doing them a favor)
10. most important of all: counter-strike is NOT a team game, there is a scoreboard for a reason. you should always strive to be at the top, so learn how to bait your teammates efficiently for as many kills as possible.

if you follow all these rules, you should get global easily, and if you ever lose, that means your opponent was cheating. good luck!"

1,2023-08-09,u/PicidaBest,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/15m9zx0/the_better_game_tho/jvgraoq/,"I feel like using this as an argument isn't too brilliant, by your logic you're saying that 2 fps with basically the same core mechanic (in this case cod and halo) are different because they have different settings (""space"" and ""earth"", although what I said here is what I understood from your comment). Basically they differ simply because they have some small features that are different between the games.

I think this can be said also for the comparison between tloz botw and genshin impact. Genshin has the same core mechanic as botw, but then built itself in a completely different direction, making it a game that isn't known as ""Zelda copycat"".

It's the same thing between valorant and csgo imo. Valorant took the base csgo and basically reworked it making some differences that make it feel like a completely new experience.

In my personal experience, csgo feels like it's more centered around the single players, as everyone can use any gear, obviously it has team play in it, but I think it's less about what everyone can do.

But I feel like valorant is more focused on the team than on the single, and that is because of the agents. It's a game where even the worst players can still be useful because of the abilities, it's a game where if you monkey pick 5 same role agents you're gonna have a hard time against a well chosen team, it's a game where losing even a single teammate can be a massive loss (something I feel isn't AS important in csgo).

All in all, you don't hear people talking much about valorant's gun gameplay, but more about it's agents, as they are what really makes valorant as a ""csgo competitor"" instead of ""just a bad copy"".

If you disagree with what I've said, please at least explain your points."

Leetify will auto-generate your best highlight from a match and if you sign up and link your Allstar account you can organize them on your profile on Allstar and remix them to add effects or create montages.

If you want more control over what content you create you can also download the Allstar desktop app to set a hotkey or type !allstar in chat (hotkey can be silent in chat). We are launching some new features that will give you the ability to have more control over what clips you get via our web platform, more on that soon.

Because we render content in the cloud using replays there is zero impact on performance, and we smart trim, tag, title and edit automatically so you don't spend time or lose any FPS or disk space to Shadowplay (you also don't need to upload etc).

Hope that's helpful, ping me on the Allstar Discord if you have more questions. Leetify Pro is great and I believe once you sign up for it they will generate a ton of clips for you using Allstar so it is a good way to get a bunch of highlights quickly."

Dont get too discouraged when people are toxic literally just more time = better. Watch a lot of videos so you can at least have a guide on a path. Its alright to look at other peoples settings and copying it but at the end of the day its how comfy you are with the settings. The top pros setting doesnt mean that you have to have the exact same settings to be good. Also for the love of god get a mic. Its a team game where communication is key and just like other team events or sports, if you cannot communicate you already adding disadvantage to you and your team.

The good news is that from now on you are going to be more aware of this, and you will be extra careful.

1. Send the trade offer
2. Confirm via your mobile device
3. Wait for the other party to accept.

The API Scam occurs during Step 2, when users are prompted to confirm the offer. Using access to the API Key, scammers cancel the offer you sent, clone the trading partners profile (using the same name and profile picture) and send a counter-offer for your item.

You can only spot the difference if you know what you're looking for! But, if you accept, the damage is already done."

Eat well, eat much. 

Training, put in the hours on aimtrainers, Aimbotz Etc.. 
Start doing that for 45+ minutes a day or so. 
I did Aimbotz eveyday after i ate breakfast and told myself im not playing a match until i have done 1500 headshots, it may sound much and you will feel like giving up after 500 but just keep going. Do as many you can until your hand/wrist starts hurting, then you can stop take a break for 5 mins and you will be ready. 

Team? 
Find yourself a good team of friends to play with that supports you, the better they are the better you wll be. I started playing with globals when i was Mge, couple months later i was lightyears ahead of them. Ever heard about ""Dont surround yourself with chickens if you wanna learn how to fly"" ? 
Playing with and against people that are better than you makes you a better player, everything they do, just suck it all in. Watch replays and see what you did wrong the times you almost died or died. Look at how your friends play if they did something good. 
Playing with people that supports you and cheers you up when you save the round or when you do something good is the best feeling, and it will keep you motivated. 

And most importantly, have fun! 
Having fun and playing with good friends is key, eating good food and staying hydrated,put in the hours, all that and more comes into play. 

Just patient and keep grinding,eventually you will get better, as evertyhing in life, you need to give it time. Youre not gonna wake up the other day playing like a top pro. Theres so much more to say, but take some tips for everything on here and find what works for you! Good luck!:)"

1 = It’s obviously “matchy” and the gloves sort of stand out
2 = Black Ties only look remotely nice when they’re MW or FN with a pattern with the least amount of rips around the knuckles, otherwise the gloves come off as a waste of money, they’re meant to be clean. 
3 = Gloves are super low key and could be at a glance easily confused with stock gloves which is the last thing you want to have happen because it’s all about that drip BB

No one here will suddenly open your eyes to the ""correct"" way to play as you could literally just be unlucky

While it could be true you're personally playing at a higher level you may not be inspiring your teammates to step up their game. I've seen far too many top fragging teammates be toxic or just have 0 game sense and are just good at clicking heads.

But at the same time it's very hard to also command your team to be better and click heads. 

I'd consider myself more of a commander so I work on getting kills without thinking about it and building muscle memory so my mind can be more occupied with the rest of the game.

Find what makes you weakest and work on that.

Maybe you can bring your .5kd player to .75kd with just a little bit of inspiration

The key word being inspiration and not just ""monke sit here shoot there"" 

Sometimes it doesn't matter what you coach people what they really need is to be inspired to play better and to be hyped up when they play well."

Sounds like your just chilling with friends now so all good. Having fun is always a good thing and depending on what region you were playing in back then GN2 was reasonably high as it was fucked everywhere except Europe.

In Australia for example GNM-MG1 was the highest you could get without cheats. Literally multiple faceit 10 players I know were GNM.

The rank system is still fucked but in a different way. YouTubers tell the community that playing for 1 win per day is key to ranking up but if you play less often you will get even more ELO for a win (points towards a rank up) but if you lose then you will lose more ELO than if you were playing daily.

This is wrong. So so wrong!

Since I have numerous accounts I've noticed that accounts that play occasionally rank up super easy.

So I did a test starting at LE and I got Supreme with a 37.5% win rate over 3 months. 3 wins and 5 losses over 3 months. Then got 2 more wins over 2 months and got Global. So 5 wins and 5 losses over 5 months and easily got Global... I'm doing it now on my main account as this was on an account I don't care about and am ranking up every win.

Losses don't even seem to matter at all if you play for 1 win a month.

As far as I can see your losses matter less the less often you play. If you play once a week they will matter way less than if you play every day and your wins will matter more. And it just keeps increasing the less often you play out to one month.

GL out there 💪"

I'm not global, highest I've ever been was winning against SMFC + globals as an MG2, but I have real life experience to back your claim. 

I used to have a very cheap setup, 60hz rusty ass monitor with a GTX something card, barely enough to run CS:GO at 60fps constant. Was Silver 4 or something back then(about 6 years ago), and there was a local event which was sorta like a dreamhack ripoff. Your everyday gaming event basically. Nothing special, but it had a LAN tournament so I thought why not. 

Joined a team of 4. They literally told me to fill and do nothing more, said they'd ""take care of it"". I thought sure, two were MG and one LEM so I'll just enjoy the cool ass setup there. 240Hz monitor and pro scene level gaming peripherals was a massive jump from my shit setup. I literally had a membrane keyboard and office mouse for my setup at home, I didn't even know mice have something akin to Hz for a screen at that time. 

I kid you not, for a good half-hour or so my eyes and hands couldn't keep up with the new speed of information. But once I did, my team was surprised I kept up with them in the first match. They saw my rank was S4, so it's understandable they thought I'd struggle. By the end of second match, I was clearly at ease and did better than these guys mechanically. I couldn't do shit after the ""rookie matches"" because the 3rd match we played was a true 5 stack that were an actual team. Trading efficiently, flash assists, high-low angle peeking, util dumping, site execs... you name it, they had it. We lost, but I was far from sad about it. I was just happy and surprised that all the times I felt I was horrible any competitive game I touch, I now realised it wasn't just me, my setup unironically is to blame too.

That was when I understood my setup matters. A LOT. Far more than some could ever imagine. Sure, practice in aimbotz and do various drills for a year, you'll be a lot fucking better than when you were playing casually.. but doesn't change the fact that even then your bad setup is holding you back from doing better."

Unfortunately not a thing, at least not universally.

Things I can recommend to control tilt:

* Don't force yourself to play. If after game one you are already tilted, take a break. If you want, you can come back later or in a few days. If you force yourself to keep requeueing, things are probably not going to go any better. Also if you only play every couple of days, you will just naturally get less tilted, but lets be real, thats not gonna happen ;D
* Have something to drink ready (no need for it to be alcoholic obviously). A sip of water after horrendously fucking up a spray might be just the thing to cool the temper.
* Have some chill music run in the background (Make sure you have a multimedia-pause/unpause button on mouse/keyboard). When the round starts, pause the music and when you die, you can resume it again.
* Try to keep invested in your team by making callouts for your teammates after you die. Especially in lower ranks people don't tend to communicate, so you can take over that part for them. No backseating obviously, just comm the same things you'd comm if it was yourself playing.
* If watching after you're dead doesn't work for you, maybe just have a youtube video open in the background that you can switch to if you die early. (Don't be the person that afks at the start of every round tho)
* If frustration really gets to you, in the moment of pure tilt try just standing up and walking one room over for a few seconds. It sometimes help me to cool down a bit.
* If you are frustrated with your teammates, you can rage at them all you want, just don't press that push-to-talk button. If you actually communicate your toxicity, things are probably just gonna spiral. Try to be nice. Being bad at the game isn't their fault, but toxic to them would be yours.

The gambling is honestly the most worrying part to me. That you really do need to figure out. Throwing away money is not the way to deal with anger.

When it comes to being toxic irl. For me after I got tilted by a game, I stop playing and go watch some youtube. After like 2-3 minutes I am usually chilling again. If its the same for you, then just do that and it shouldn't be too much of an issue. If the tilt from CS actually impacts you for hours after, then maybe you really should be playing less."

You’d expect your trade to be as you sent it but since your api is compromised, a bit changed your offer so that you send your gut knife for nothing.

Your friend has been hijacked after they entered their Steam login in a place where it does not belong. Their profile was changed to make them give into the real point of the scheme: Trading their items so that they can be stolen.
DO NOT TRADE.

There is a bot in their account, which forwards all valuable trades to an imposter account.
The usual steps to clean this infection are:

- change your password
- deauthorise all other devices
- revoke your API key
- if using a mobile authenticator, order new backup codes

Best way to prevent this in the future is to do Steam logins only through the website of Steam. Honest sites will carry it over and not ask for your name and password again."

I agree that creating separate servers in Russia would be a great solution for players, as it would result in lower ping, the ability to communicate in the same language, etc. 

However, I do not fully agree with the main argument that is often presented here - 'all Russians are toxic, all Russians kick foreigners, all Russians constantly speak in Russian and they are just bad' (exaggerated). In over 1500 hours of gameplay, I have practically not encountered toxic players, and if I did, they were not only Russians. The key factor influencing this strongly is your trust factor. It's an obvious fact - the lower it is, the lower it will be for your teammates. Now, regarding the Russian language - essentially, every Russian learns English in school, and the positions on the map are often borrowed from the English language. That's why in my games, I only recognized that I was playing with Russians based on their accent or their Steam profiles. As for endless conversations - I often hear ENDLESS SILENCE in voice chat, which, in reality, is not much better. 

I understand that this comment is essentially useless, as it is unlikely to change your opinion, but I just wanted to share my point of view. Have a nice day :)"

1. First off, shoutout to the Valve logo for its secret hint! Who knew that the 'E' shrinking was actually a clue and not just a graphical design choice? Must be the same reason my coffee cup is smaller at the top – it's secretly pointing to the fact that I need more caffeine.
2. The Twitter handle u/e having secret clues to Valve? Oh yes, of course! It's just like my Uncle Bob having secret clues to the whereabouts of the lost city of Atlantis because he likes to fish.
3. The exact midpoint between LA and Valve is Button Mountain? That's some impeccable geography skills. But why stop at buttons? Surely, somewhere there's a 'Joystick Mountain' or 'Keyboard Canyon' we can factor in.
4. Converting 1,000 to binary and then reversing it? Genius! It's just like when I reverse my age in binary, I'm actually only 5... at least mentally.
5. The underscore character (\_) as a vital clue is truly mind-boggling. And here I was, all these years, thinking underscores were just a way for programmers to avoid using spaces in variable names.
6. The deep investigation into the number plate ending in 6. I mean, if that isn't proof, what is? And here I've been wasting my time looking at license plates trying to win at the license plate game during road trips.
7. Counting vehicles in de\_dust2? Brilliant! Though, I'm a bit surprised we didn't factor in the number of sand grains or how often players shout ""Rush B!""
8. And finally, the impeccable logic that because tomorrow is the last Tuesday in August, it MUST be the release date for CS2. Of course! Just like how the last Friday of every month is when unicorns make their monthly appearance in my backyard.

In conclusion, this theory is so brilliantly complex, it makes Da Vinci Code look like a children's book. So yes, let's get hyped for the TRUE CSTuesday. And if CS2 doesn’t release tomorrow, well... I guess it's just waiting for the appearance of Joystick Mountain. 🕹🏔"
1,2023-08-30,u/Kreynus,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/164hkfn/pettition_to_make_special_server_for_russians_in/jycgupi/,"Setting up or buying new servers for the CIS region would not only benefit European players but russians as well. I live in turkey(fuck me, I know) and I speak decent English so I never had problems with communicating with other players but majority of turks don't speak English. I know that turks are considered similar to russians when considering their in game behaviour. The thing is, turks don't want to play with non-turkish speaking people as well. They don't want to have 70-80ping while the enemy team has 20-30. So having dedicated servers for the CIS region and another server for Turkey would benefit everyone. We would get low ping and turkish speaking players while europeans would've gotten rid of the toxic non-english speaking players."

1,2023-08-31,u/DescriptionWorking18,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/16620n2/just_joined_up/jykjc90/,"First of all, let’s get your sensitivity in a good spot. You know how in games with ADS you typically get more control (lower sens) once you ADS? Well, since there is mostly no ADS in this game you’re going to want to lower your hipfire sens down to a comfortable place, kinda like what you’d have while ADS’ing in other games. Maybe even a bit lower than what you’re used to. You don’t need high sens at all in this game as it’s a game of angles. You want to peek each angle in turn, always staying behind cover of some sort so you can’t be seen from the angles you aren’t fighting/haven’t cleared yet. This game will punish you very quickly if you’re out in the open.

Remember that you won’t be very accurate unless you’re standing still. Crouching will make you more accurate, but you don’t want to use it all the time. Crouching should be a deliberate decision to gain accuracy long range or to move your head out of the way for certain fights.

Your character has momentum in this game, so simply letting go of your movement key is not enough. You need to cancel your momentum by tapping the opposite direction you were just traveling. This will make you accurate pretty much immediately and is called “counter strafing.” The reason it’s called counter strafing is because almost all of your fights will happen using only the left and right (A and D) buttons. You want to get ready to fight and then step sideways (strafe) out of cover to start fighting. Don’t peek holding while holding W+A or W+D at the same time. This will make it harder to counterstrafe because you’ll need to press both the opposite movement key and S to cancel diagonal momentum, and it is better to peek out perpendicular to the enemy or else you’ll appear to move slower on their screen than if you only strafed into the fight.

Accuracy is king here, so I wouldn’t recommend using LMG’s unless you’re trying to lay down suppressive fire while defending an area. You’ll want to play a lot of deathmatch to get your mechanics down, and prioritize learning the starting pistols (usp and Glock) and the main rifles (M4 and AK). Headshots do roughly 4 times the damage as body shots so this is why the lower sens is a good choice.

Good luck! This is a tough game to get into so don’t get discouraged if you aren’t good for a while. It takes most people about 1000 hours just to get the basics down lol, and there’s a ton of people with 2000-3000 hours who are still quite bad at the game. <3"

I've been daily driving this keyboard ever since it came out in 2022 and still feels amazing for both work and gaming. Comment anything that I might have missed! 

Pros 
1. Cherry MX switches 
2. Full Keyboard layout with numb pad
3. Sturdy frame, won't break if you slam it
4. RGB if you are into that or you can turn it off without installing ICUE
5. Pretty alright anti-ghosting 
6. Dedicated Skip, Pause and volume buttons. You will be surprised how many keyboards do not have these essential buttons.
7. Low activation pressure 

Cons
1. Corsair's iCUE software is complete dogshit and should be avoided at all costs
2. Pretty Pricy costing $150 AUD on Amazon

 Premier mode is here to stay as it replaces faceit to a degree, and Im sure both parties have come to some sort of agreement in development where they are working together on the Elo System.

Mentioned aswell the badge rank system applying to Specific Maps you play and are proficient at.   You might be Silver 2 on Mirage but Global on Dust 2, for example,  so,  there's additional achievements to grind.  which is always a bonus.

The AK and M4A4 spray patterns need to be looked at as they are both out of whack compared to CSGO.  I'm not entirely sure if this is intended or a bug. But it's annoying.

I hope they add some sort of pity system to case openings , $5 to open a case between key+case costs for a $0.12 blue that you've received 20 times already. Just is way to predatory,  considering children play this game.

If you add the same alias pattern to the manual keybind input select for the grenades, then in the case you do not have the grenade, it will switch your weapon, which doesn't follow the behavior of the cs go command. This would lead to pulling out the pistol in undesirable scenarios potentially.


If you replace the ""pistol"" call in the keybinds with ""bind ""KEY"" rifle"" then the select last will properly pull out the priority weapon (ie. Primary then secondary if you do not have a primary). the binds that call the pistol alias, you won't swap weapons and it will rebind the priority to your primary weapon. 


If you use individual bind for every grenade, create an alias for it just like I did, The reason for the alias is I always want to switch back first to the primary, if you don't create an alias, it might switch to secondary, depends on what was used last

Tl;dr Change pistol alias call to bind ""KEY"" rifle. Also you should bind your grenade keys to follow the pattern for the other slot selections as well.


E.g


//Weapons Switch (invnextgun)


alias rifle ""slot2;slot1;bind ""KEY"" pistol""


alias pistol ""slot1;slot2;bind ""KEY"" rifle""


alias knife ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot3""


alias grenade ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot4""


alias C4 ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot5;


alias he_grenade ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot6""


alias flash ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot7""


alias smoke ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot8""


alias decoy ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot9""


alias incendiary ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot10""


alias zeus ""bind ""KEY rifle;slot9""


bind ""1"" ""rifle""


bind ""2"" ""pistol"" 


bind ""3"" ""knife""


bind ""4"" ""grenade""


bind ""5"" ""C4""

E.g

bind mouse4 he_grenade

bind mouse5 flash

etc...)

In this clip, you still had some momentum when shooting the first bullet, which is why it missed. If you want to see this visualized a bit more. Just run parallel to a wall and spray at it with an AK. You can immediately see how any movement will cause high inaccuracy.

However stopping to shoot takes a while. If you just let go of the movement key, you still have some momentum in its direction. This is where you can ""counter-strafe"" to stop faster. Instead of just letting go the movement key, lets say ""a"", you can quickly tap the opposite movement key ""d"". This immediately cancels the remaining momentum and makes your shots accurate. It is a hard skill to learn, but essential to becoming good at the game.

Also sometimes you just get scammed by the game and shots just don't hit because they don't feel like it. Even when perfectly still, weapons still have some inherent inaccuracy, which can really mess stuff up on longer ranges."

The only question is if there's a drive to do it, from the cheat makers perspective, which there is, there's an insane economy there, check some of the bigger public cheats member count..

Face it AC still gets bypassed, ESEAs AC still got bypassed, Valorants AC still gets bypassed, LAN tourneys can still end up with cheaters.

Yes you can delay the inevitable, but all you're really doing is closing the gap of who 'can' cheat by making the cost to cheat go up based on the work the cheat dev does and how they decide to price it.

Some examples:
ESEA AC can be bypassed with spoofed PCI devices.
FaceIT AC can be bypassed by spoofing a driver with your modified code.
Valorant's AC actually is quite obscure in terms of bypassing, but there are cheats that run on a separate PC and stream the cheats to your main PC using a device you have to purchase and pay subscriptions for.

ALL anticheats can be bypassed with a simple solution that's been on yt many times before shown here:
https://youtu.be/ne9bmMX82iY?feature=shared

Since you can just not run the software on your own PC, and it simply moves the mouse physically, you cannot tell.

You'll cut down on the majority sure, while also running the risk of losing the players that don't like invasive software, all the while, the cheaters still remain.

The more viable solution that VALVe is likely taking:
Let the cheater run rampant, collect signatures and modified game data over time, create an AI to try to counter this actively in game.

They're likely letting the cheaters run rampant in open beta to allow their VAC Live learn from what's possible under the new engine, as that data hadn't yet been received before in terms of CS.

Final note:
Invasive software is just that, invasive.
I would rather not get banned mid game by using obscure software compared to mainstream derivatives that doesn't actually cheat in the game, but gets me banned because it's that unknown and may hook into the game, e.g. overlays, debugging software, or otherwise, software meant for other games that do not actively affect CS.

Nor would I rather have it actively scanning background processes, taking keystrokes for modifier keys on cheats, seeing what files get written/saved to during gameplay, or various other caveats that come with an invasive AC.

These while individually can work to do what they want without harming users, is still a very frowned upon process, simply because it gives them more access to user data and insight on user's actions during gameplay, which may otherwise not be necessary to collect whatsoever, all so little billy can just spend another 3$ on a cracked CSGO account, and just do it all over again, because even HWID bans are redundant with how easy they can be to spoof or bypass."

I noticed a significant difference going from a 75hz monitor to 240hz, but the improvement was probably also to do with the fact it was a newer, better quality panel.

Definitely get a good mouse, don't need to go nuts but get something that feels comfortable with adjustable DPI. Mousepad is largely down to personal preference but it does help. A lot of people like the Steelpad QcK, it's inexpensive and gets the job done. Keyboard is less important but also helps. I've used some form of MX518 for as long as I've been playing CS.

playing on Anubis just always reminds me of Valorant map design, almost every spot on the map has 3-4 angles you could reasonably be pushed from at all times and very little cover. It encourages spastic gameplay, more quick flicks and quick reactions needed.   


  
If I'm on B mirage all I need to watch is cat, apps, and market and there is PLENTY on site to hide from 2/3 or even ALL angles whenever I want so I can pick my fights as they come.  


If I'm on B Anubis then it's now B-main, B-con, street, and Palace that I need to watch and pretty much the only spot on that site where you can guarantee you wont have your back to an angle where someone could come is the upper platform on back site. One GOOD spot to hold site from.  


If I want to watch mirage B apps there is literally at least 3 different spots I can sit in cover from the other angles and watch apps. If I want to watch Anubis B main there is almost nowhere that is safe from B-con and literally nowhere on site will be safe from the back platform if they push mid.  


The way Anubis is DESIGNED is exactly why I don't want to play it unless I have a full que so I know I have teammates that will cover important angles. Having a mid presence in Anubis is honestly really key just for info and yet every premier match I've gotten NO-ONE will go there but me. And again you might say ""well this sounds like a problem with the players"" but maps like Dust 2 and Mirage literal brand new players will understand the importance of some mid control, the layout of Anubis is so counter-intuitive that players just seem to think mid control in it isn't very worthwhile despite it being QUITE powerful."

The closed beta started on November 30, 2011, and was initially restricted to around ten thousand people who received a key at events intended to showcase Global Offensive. After issues with client and server stability were addressed, the beta was opened up to progressively more people,[27] and at E3 2012, Valve announced that Global Offensive would be released on August 21, 2012, with the open beta starting roughly a month before that.

And I was never aware that cs community is basically just scammers and scammer supporters because I have never played a game with such a criminal community like csgo.

So I tried to trade with a friend, scammer cancelled the trade and opened a new one with a bot.

I wasn’t aware of something like this was possible at all, so I clicked confirm without thinking.

Then boom scammer took my knifes.

Then when I asked community what to do, guess what? Most people was just laughing and supporting the scammers just like here on Reddit. And only one or two person was nice enough to show me the procedure to how to stay safe.

Try unbinding/rebinding any keys that you tend to spam, and check your autoexec for any weird binds that could be flooding the server, because I'm 99% sure that's what is happening.

Go deauthorize all accounts, revoke your api key, change email, change password. Delete all website extensions, clear browser history

How to 100% avoid this next time? Always confirm 3 times on your mobile confirmation that the full name and the date they joined steam matches the one you are trading with,   Api scam are always bots with a different name.

It also includes some other goodies like the posibility of forcing a resolution, *any* resolution. Upscaling methods like FSR are integrated and can be toggled on any program with a keybind.

What I was trying get at was that the time to kill in this game is so low that aim alone will not save you, there's very little room for hesitation. Deathmatch with it now being Free for All only makes this even worse. You have to proactively position yourself so I you cannot be shot before you start shooting, that's not easy to learn in deathmatch, especially in CS2. The TTK is often lower than the network round trip time, if you can be shot and you have been shot, your client might not know until after you've already aimed and fired, you might not have missed, you were just already dead for the server and the person shooting you.  
Also, while, I do agree that you should wait before shooting, that's only if the enemy doesn't realize you are there or you think you can move away before you get shot, take that time to better assess the situation. But, IMO, the counting thing just isn't as effective with mouse & keyboard games, for IRL (airsoft, Nerf, firearms) and VR games where you have to deal with your hands and body physically not being able to stay still and everything having meaningful amounts of inertia, it works great, you know for sure that you aren't moving & the gun is still going to be pointed where you want it to be when it fires. Mice don't have that problem, they really don't meaningfully move when you aren't intending to move them. Literally just click on the enemies like you do when using a computer normally."

If you kick the scammer out of your account and create a new password - but they already created an API-key, the API-key will still be active, unless you actively revoke it.

That means the scammer can manipulate your trades and scam you, without actually having access to your account - mainly by creating fake trades to ""dupe"" accounts - so it looks like you are trading with the person you are supposed to.

But when you actually realise how terrible the hitboxes are, the lags / server connections, the numerous amounts of features missed out from csgo e.g view model bobbing, counter strafing mid air is no longer a thing, there is no cl_righthand 0 1, all they’ve done is make the game shiny and pretty on the eyes, removed key features, and added more problems.

didn’t you ALSO mention in a previous comment that you said YOURSELF valve “didn’t release a new case or operation” because they didn’t seem the state of the game to be “acceptable”?

You’re acting like a real hypocrite and clearly have no idea what you’re talking about. Especially parading around with less than 100 hours total in csgo/cs2, you are definitely not the man to decide what is best for cs."

Something around 800 edpi is good (DPI x sens), feel free to go lower or higher if you want but you generally want to move the camera view pivoting at the elbow and make small adjustments with your wrist. Think of how in COD your aim down sights sensitivity usually gets lower and easier to control than your hipfire. Since it’s mostly hipfire in CS you need you hipfire sens to be low or you’ll generally get outaimed. Stick to you sensitivity unless you have a good reason to change it. You will get used to it if you stick it out. Headshots are what you want to try for, so keep that crosshair high up at head height at all times. You need to get your mechanics in a good place so educate yourself on peeking and preaiming (search on YouTube). You MUST counter strafe every time you move. You will not be accurate unless your cancel your momentum by tapping the opposite key to stop. Do not ever peek while holding W. Literally always engage in fights with just A and D, never W+D or W+A. It’s too hard to counter strafe that way. Google counter strafing if you’re confused. Then I’d play deathmatch every single day, at least one game. I’d pick ONE map and only play that map, learning smokes for important areas. You’ll know what areas are important because you die from them a lot. Then I’d just play at least 2 games a day and grind it out. Don’t be afraid to die or make mistakes. Allow yourself to make mistakes and always figure out why what you did didn’t work. Test your limits. The more mistakes you make right now, the less mistakes you’ll make in the future. Good luck!"

You get these drops when you level up (from XP, not rank), but only once a week.

You can have a nice load out for relatively cheap from the steam market. I would advise against gambling or opening cases (if you get cases through a drop, you still have to buy the keys for them which is massively more expensive than the price of the average drop you will get).

Browse the market and you will find nice skins for cheap. The skins also have a ""wear quality"", meaning on most skins there will be some wear and tear based on the wear quality. This has an effect on prices as well. In most cases higher quality will be more expensive. Field tested quality is a good middle ground (for me) where most skins are still enjoyable but not so much more expensive like factory new ones.

So yes you can get stuff for free. But 99% of times it's ugly skins that are worth 0.03 dollars on the market (the minimum amount)"

Two things to improve on if you're looking to:

1. Keep that crosshair at head height! You can always adjust your spray downward for another 1 or 2 kills, but the first kill being an instant headshot will save you more times then you think
2. Try to shift walk more (Or whatever key is your walk button) because if someone was Market there they could've heard you moving and alerted the Cat players to your location.  A very good thing to try is to find an angle that you can only be seen by one location and hold it, or try to walk around more often.

In theory, you do not need that command as if you do it right in windows & your mouse settings, there should be no mouse acceleration.

To disable mouse acceleration in windows:
1.	Open the Windows Start menu and type “Mouse Settings” in the search bar. Click on “Mouse Settings” from the search results.
2.	In the Mouse Settings window, locate and click on “Additional mouse options” on the right side. This will open the Mouse Properties window.
3.	In the Mouse Properties window, go to the “Pointer Options” tab at the top.
4.	Under the “Pointer Options” tab, you will see a section called “Motion.” Within this section, there should be an option called “Enhance pointer precision.” This is Windows’ mouse acceleration feature. Uncheck this option to disable mouse acceleration.
5.	Click the “Apply” button at the bottom of the window to save your changes, and then click “OK” to close the Mouse Properties window.

Regarding fps cap:
Do not limit fps less than refresh rate, it will cause screen tear, I have seen cases where framerate was locked 1 fps less than refresh rate and it caused tear, CS was unplayable to me (143fps & 144hz on samsung monitor)
Guideline a lot of people use is: max fps = 2x of ur hz, so if u use 240Hz, cap ur fps at 480, if you’re not close to 480 fps, limit it to your monitors refresh rate, it is supposed to be better - did not test it, just read about it from people that did test it.
I saw people using 240Hz monitors at 288FPS & 144Hz, because their avg fps is less than 240 or around 240.
Myself I use fps cap of 300 FPS in CS2 because my avg fps is around 300 when it’s uncapped and I’m using 144Hz.
Oh, more fps also means less input lag, think about this too, if you want less input lag but “unsmooth” performance or a little bit more input lag and smooth performance.
My personal opinion about this: find what suits YOU and stick to it.

Regarding game feeling off:
It’s just subtick, I assume.
Idk if it was placebo or not, but when I used aliases for movement to de-subtick WASD, walk, crouch and jump, it felt more consistent to me, now that they took it away, it feels weird again. Again, I do not know if it’s placebo or not - did not test it just played pugs with it. 

Regarding polling rate:
Set it to 1000hz, there is no benefit of using 500hz polling rate, we’re living in 2023… 1000hz = 1ms 500hz = 2ms.
The higher polling rate provides more frequent updates from the mouse to the computer, resulting in smoother and more precise cursor or crosshair movement.

Key points:

1.	Avoid limiting your FPS below your monitor’s refresh rate to prevent screen tearing.
2.	Many gamers use the guideline of capping FPS at 2x the refresh rate, which can help reduce screen tearing and improve the gaming experience.
3.	Some individuals may use lower refresh rates than their monitor’s maximum if their system’s average FPS is close to or slightly lower than the monitor’s native refresh rate to balance performance and smoothness.
4.	Customizing your FPS cap based on your system’s capabilities and personal preferences is a good approach.
5.	It’s essential to consider the trade-off between input lag and smoothness. Higher FPS generally results in lower input lag, but the trade-off might be less smooth performance.

Oh, tell your friend to up his sens, if he cant do a 180° turn his sens is too low. Im using 400 dpi at 1000hz, 1.4sens ingame no accel and i can barely do 180° turn with one swipe - thats a rule I use when setting sens: one swipe = 180° turn, but again this is totally personal preference, there is no one-size-fits-all when we get to sensitivity it’s a matter of personal preference and playstyle. 
This is the same tip I gave to a friend when he used to play at 500 dpi and 0.4 sens, he was inconsistent. He upped his sens to 0.9 now he is consistent more than ever! (He needed like 5 swipes to do a 180° which is crazy, imagine having to lift your mouse 5 times to get the cursor where you want it to be)

Other stuff he could be doing is analysing his own demos and looking at his lowlights, why he died, how he died, what could’ve he done to not die in that situation etc..

Again, this is purely stuff I figured out through the years of gaming and watching videos and reading online guides, it might not be accurate to a T.

TL;DR:
Dont cap ur fps lower than ur hz
Disable maccel in windows
Find your avg fps and cap it to your avg - feels better for me, but find your sweet spot and use it
Polling rate @ 500Hz was used in the old days, because 1000Hz would lag for some people because pc specs were not that good, now that we have cpus that can handle that, 1000Hz should be better than 500Hz.

So every instance of mouse movement or keyboard button press. So if you're aiming really quickly sometimes the shot will be behind where you actually clicked because the mouse click button registers before all the mouse movement inputs have time to catch up. The other thing is the peakers advantage. This induces really high latency so if someones just sitting there you're gonna see them a lot sooner than they see you if you're moving quickly. because you're both seeing past versions of their movements. I don't know if they've fixed this yet but it was really funny to just rush every corner and headshot everyone. It looked like they were just sitting there staring at nothing.

I can very well say that a small 10-15% of people i played with, did NOT deserve to be there. I myself on an alt account got ranked from SEM - LEM With just 12 wins in a row. Basically every game i ranked up. Weird phenomenon but it happens that some people get ranked poorly. In your case, you got ranked lower than you feel was appropriate and i got ranked higher than what I felt was appropriate. The ranking system literally blows. It’s no wonder why we all have come across that one player in whatever rank, out performing higher ranked players that queued in game. Not saying you didnt deserve global or silver but, it is possible you’ve been led to believe your actual rank is lower than it was. I firmly believe im around the MG ranks. Period. But yet i remain in lem-global range.. all because i win games. Winning shouldnt be the key factor in ranking or deranking imo. They need a much more sophisticated system that really compares all players internationally. Glhf in your future games 💪🏼"

For anyone that happens across this and shares this issue, I resolved it by just swapping the rebind and duck commands, as follows:

alias test2 ""-duck; bind ctrl test""

bind ctrl test

Stuff like this is great because it illustrates a key issue with CS2 players; that they sucked at CSGO and now they suck at CS2 with a convenient excuse to blame something other than themselves. Movement is exactly the same as CSGO. Nothing changed to make you worse. 

It's same thing with people suddenly acting like sub-ticks are the reason they're missing shots they thought they hit. That shit is practically part of CS' DNA with it being a legitimate skill issue 90% of the time. Maybe you really did hit that shot, but chances are you're just coping. None of us actually understand how the server ticks work beyond bigger numbers = better servers. Stop acting like you do. 

CS2 definitely has issues, feeling like a public beta at times, but compared to CS:GO's first few YEARS this isn't that bad. Most of the issues it does have could have easily been excused if Valve marked CS2 properly and communicated their intentions better. Unfortunately that's always been a sore spot for them."

like its just not fun to not play comp if u want to play the game as intended. unless ur purely playing for fun, but some peoples fun is playing it competetively so...

problem of the above (that comp is pretty much a must for anyone who doesnt want mindless crazy fck fiestas and wants to play the game) is that comp is filled with all kinds of people ranging from very low effort and passion, to very high. many casual players simply play comp beause they somewhat have to. and when they get paired with the gamer that is passionate about ranking up, takes the game very seriously, its not a good mix."

&#x200B;

\- i have never had more issues with cs2 than anyone else (some packet loss here and there, overall cs2 experience)

\- since today, my game plays like if i had an insanely high ping, this includes:

\-- when i try to switch weapons it doesnt work most of the times. i have to press the corresponding button really really often because the game keeps lagging back to what i had equipped before. Animations while doing this stutter a lot and i have an ak in my hand in one frame, and in the next frame i am in the middle of inspect animation on a grenade

\-- shooting enemies.. well its laggy. heavily. i shoot and quite some seconds later the shot registers if it was a kill.

\-- movement same thing. i get rubberbanded and tp'd all over the place. when i do small strafes i keep walking a bigger distance than the duration i held the move key. even if i give it just a real short tap i move quite a bit. also this strafing movement is not normal, it looks like i am sliding sideways on ice.

\- i have none of these issues in any other game, and i play a lot competitive games like street fighter, tekken, rocket league, assetto corsa...

\- while the game behaves this way i have a stable and low ping. usually i am always on sub 20ms, rather around 10ms.

\- i have no background tasks or anything that is pulling resources from my pc (and also, i can open another game parallel to cs2 and it works normally, while cs2 does its thing)

\- i have an intel i9 9900k and a rtx 3080, 32gb ram, 1gbit/s connection (stable and working everywhere else)

&#x200B;

i really do not know what to do anymore. i have reinstalled the game, did all possible updates on my pc.

Game is all of a sudden completely unplayable for me right now and i have no clue why.

&#x200B;

See the clip i posted. Sadly in this clip i dont really have contact with enemies, but you can see really well how f'd up my movement is with all the sliding and bugging, also how i am unable to equip or change weapons/grenades for quite some extended amounts of time."

- subticked movement is broken. When you hit a movement key, you will have a different starting velocity every time based on your subtick time stamp. Since it’s so inconsistent, trying to jiggle peak can and will result in you over peaking an angle.

- peekers advantage is still a serious issue due to the lag interpolation overcompensating for the subtick system

- sprays still don’t show where your bullets are actually going. Again this is likely due to subtick as your bullets are going where they’re time stamped instead of being based on where your crosshair is at the moment the bullet fires.

- jumping is extremely inconsistent once again thanks to subticked movement.

- flick shots for every single weapon often don’t even go where your crosshair is, and again this is due to the sub tick system causing your bullet to lag behind where your crosshair is.

The game is mechanically broken and this is just stuff I notice and bothers me every time I play. This shouldn’t be happening in a game that wants to be taken seriously as an eSport. Long time players, high level players, pros are ALL complaining about this, the fact that you’re saying “it’s fine” or are even acting as if you have any validity to speak for “endgame” level players is laughable and I’m very glad valve doesn’t listen to you.

11,2023-11-15,u/HarryBallsck,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/17v6gz7/average_premier_experience/k9aesxw/,"Im not an expert but you could watch some rounds on Twitch if pro teams play a tournament to see what happens. I rarely watch esports, let alone a whole game, but what Ive learned for example is the exact scenario in this video. If you (as T side) win the pistol round, especially without planting the bomb, buy all 5 aks and spend all your money, it will be a catastrophe if you lose that round. Because the CT side will have your weapons, a good amount of money and you're kinda fucked the 3rd and 4th round. So what do (almost every) pro teams do? They buy 4 galils and 1 ak for example. Or they go for mac10s or some kind of smgs. But NEVER 5 aks. It's just not worth it, because you should also be able to win that 2nd round with galils/smgs. So thats the explanation on this video.

Rest of the rules which apply to us (as non pro players) is to communicate and actually agree on what to buy and what not. Like in this same example, what should the CT side do? Do they force with mp9s? Or are they gonna full eco? Thats a decision that has to be made together. Me and my friends often go for just a grenade and try to stack some nades together hoping to get some kills and a good eco. And if we, for example, play with 1-2 randoms, we try to involve them into our decision making. And IF it happens that 3 people want to eco after losing some rounds (or the pistol round) and 2 people decide not to listen and just buy, its better to buy too. Because (ill wrap up my story), if 3 people eco and 2 people buy, you're likely to lose the round. And the next round 3 people have money and the other 2 have to eco now. As a casual player who doesn't play cs all day, that is extremely hard.

So long story short:
Try to watch a full game or summary on Twitch if theres a tourney and try to understand why they make those decisions.
And for casual players like you and me, communication is key. It sounds easy and logical, but communication is not just giving callouts but also discussing tactics and what you guys want to buy and what not. Hope this helps!

P.S. just came up. Also like 2-3 snipers on the T side is a no go. Maybe if you're up 8-0 and you all have like 12-16k cash. But not with a tight game. 1 guy could awp or even no one."

Lets say you're down 1-4 and you all have around $1500 but the 5th guy has like $6000 for whatever reason. He should not be selfish and buy an awp or big gun like m4 or AK, while you guys have to eco. You either all decide to eco, also the one with $6000. OR he should buy the rest of the team small guns like deagle, mp9/mac10.

The cash can't be withdrawn per se - but the price you'd get is reliable. Here too please do not just see the buy order prices and list it for that, check previous sales in the week and the price of the current listings. Put your ak up accordingly. When you do put up your ak on the market it will disappear from your inv (whenever you remove it from the market it will come back instantly so don't worry). 
As the steam community market is the official valve made system it is the safest starting point if you've never dealt with any 3rd party sites. 
When your ak does sell you'd get funds in your steam wallet directly (some times there's a holding time of 1-2 days). Once you get your wallet funds you can spend them on other skins on the market, buying games, buying keys, buying stuff in other games that are on your steam etc. 
Hope this helps"

2,2023-11-19,u/DaveTheDolphin,https://www.reddit.com/r/csgo/comments/17z8csx/any_keyboard_recommendations/k9yby3w/,"Any keyboard going above 150 is either catering to the custom keyboard community (which is fine if you’re into it ~~I certainly am rocking a $500+ board~~) or has an artificially inflated price.

Most any mechanical keyboard from a gaming company like Logitech, Razer, steelseries will be fine. No matter the switch type (linear, tactile, clicky) they’ll be geared toward having very light force to activate. So it’s purely preference which switch to choose. Though most gamers will choose to go with linear switches as there is no “bump” or initial resistance when pushing down on a key

That said, Some key points you’ll want to consider when purchasing a keyboard

- I mentioned earlier that going over 150 is usually overkill or overpay. The exception to this rule (aside from customs) are keyboards that use a magnetic or optical key switch. Keyboards with this tech technically aren’t “mechanical” because they don’t rely on a physical contact to activate an input, and are theoretically faster. Very often, these boards also come with software that will allow you to change the activation point of the key switch so you don’t have to press all the way down to activate it. If you *really* wanted the competitive “advantage”, going with a keyboard with these kinds of switches is the way to go. But I would say, that this advantage isn’t the most significant with CS or for anyone outside of the top percent of players.

- Hotswap. Hotswap is a keyboard feature that allows you to take out switches without needing to disassemble your board entirely. Making replacing any broken switch(es) simple. Or, if you wanted to have different switches entirely, you can just swap them out without needing to buy a whole new keyboard. It’s not the most important decision but it’s convenient and can make your keyboard last even longer as long as you don’t break the pcb or other"

- Do not push movement keys while shooting a rifle.

- Maps played so often for so long with a competitive mindset that utility use has become a library of information you should memorise, both with how to use and how to hold against.
- the whole economy thing, eco rounds etc.

Apex in contrast to this is simple AF, run around, loot, shoot people, survive. Just the movement and spray patterns of CS alone contradicts muscle memory built up by practically any other mainstream shooter"

dont believe me? https://youtu.be/fiGarzzt9dQ?si=sYksjHszDR2DWgMv heres a youtube video with a hand cam and a keyboard cam about this exact thing made by someone and shared around a lot, you can clearly see he isnt cheating yet he gets banned, as well if you dont believe me vac live only detects spinners, go ahead and full monkey rage with undetek and tell me if you get banned or even untrusted, i cheat i dont care what you think about me cheating because i dont use non hvh cheats and only hvh(hack vs hack) which is a different comunity that doesnt play on matchmaking servers, we have our own we dont need to play on there, however its instant ban if you use a detected cheat right now like aimware or nexus crack

Also valve doesnt hwid or ip ban, hacker gets banned? new account and back to ruining peoples games or mm hvhing like an asshole it will detect a resolver maybe but not a powerful aimbot

speaking from experience (2500 hours, 1 WR, a few top 10s, one of them being utopia), i would just say to keep surfing, as you get better just by playing more and more. you will find most high level surfers tend to just surf and rack up hours learning as they play.

a few key things to note though that would benefit you now:
- low sensitivity can help with being smoother
- most of your mouse movements should all flow in a connected motion, i personally never find myself in the air without strafing to build more units (this optimization improves as you surf more)
- when boarding ramps, try and not land exactly parallel to the ramp, but instead arc onto it as if you already are surfing on it to keep as much speed as possible
- try and get down key fundamentals of source movement and syncing your a/d keypresses with left/right mouse movement as good as possible

tips for down the line:
- i suggest watching other good surfers, such as the world record runs uploaded onto KSFrecords. this teaches routes that are achievable with more experience
- for more unit based maps, like utopia, i like to find spots in the map out of habit to check my units and benchmark it mentally compared to other runs, as it helps recognize whether a run is good or not, since following a route isn’t the only thing needed for a fast time
- try and learn how to prestrafe, which starts you off with more units, there’s guides on youtube that visualize these mechanics

TLDR: surf more and you will improve, some mechanics you won’t be able to learn well without a good base understanding so take your time and enjoy the game. my discord dms are always open for questions @zharo :)"

In comparison a Mil-Spec tier weapon skin (also called blue skins, because these skins have a blue haze around the skin in the inventory icon) has a roughly ~75% chance of dropping from a case. 

So in theory, you'd need to open ~400 cases in order to pull a knife, based on probability. Considering each key costs $2.20 and you spend $0.50 for one case, that's over a thousand dollars worth of case openings just to have the chance of pulling a knife.

Keep in mind that there are dozens of different skins with different wear ratings and with or without stattrak. There is a very slim chance that you'll break even, even if you do get a knife after opening so many cases (in theory). at that point, why not just take your money and buy the skin outright from the marketplace? 

In the end, you got extremely lucky. So don't go by and open cases in the hopes of pulling another knife. Or go for it. However it is never worth it and just like other forms of gambling, it's addictive and you should see it as a hobby. Gamble responsibly."

Many take advantage of the fact governments aren't taxing them.  It's a way to quickly exchange items of value with people across the world.  As shipping prices increase they offer a way to avoid that as well.  Before skins I used to flip gift cards but those had so many more risks.  Before the 7 day trade ban skins were extremely liquid and keys were even used for money laundering they were so liquid.  They can be used as a currency to skirt gambling laws as well.  

They also give 'prestige' in a time when people care as much about their online image as they do their IRL selves.  (Some people put far more time into their lives online even.)  You could see these as designer clothes for people who aren't going out to bars but instead get most of their interaction through a screen.  Using a CS skin now doesn't feel that different than overpaying for some brand name shirt to look nice at a bar back in college in my eyes.

> a legitimate investment in something

Even people who have made fairly poor investment choices have made profit in the CS market if they've been in for 3-5+ years.   People who have been in longer or who made great investments have profited absurdly.  I keep most of my money in traditional investments but these do offer a unique opportunity.   I can't believe some of my things were 20x before CS2 launch and are still 10x even with the current poor market conditions."

One of those matches I remembered specifically because it was pretty much a HVH between the two teams with 9 cheaters, only 6 where banned since the last time I checked the match, and all 9 where either spinbotting or rage hacking. 

There are also dozens of blatent spinbotters/rage hackers still not banned that are on my blocklist still. 

When I played CS2 global launch, while the number of blatent cheaters has drastically dropped, now I'm noticing at least 2 players per match (and no, not just enemies my teammates to) that feel like they are playing with way to much info. 

Im talking only using Mollys to clear corners players are actually playing, pushing sites without checking half the angles but never getting shot in the back, always peaking at just the right time for the enemy to either look away or pull out a made. When 1-2 people per match are doing that stuff 10+ times a game then it becomes very suspicious. 

If I play high elo valorant lobbies compared to high elo CS lobbies, Valorant players play much more natural, they properly clear angles and sites and if your playing something super weird you will catch people off guard consistantly.

In CS, doesn't matter what off angles you play, when you peak etc, someone is always W keying onto site with there crosshair glued to your peak angle."

As for the language... I agree, there are players who can speak English and simply don't do so playing with English-speaking teammates. If they do it because of their ego, they are dicksuckers. But the situation is that most players don't know English or have no language practice. I have many friends who are simply afraid of being misunderstood, so they often don’t use mik at all.

Before the update:
When you shoot the client (your pc) calculates base on a random seed(a number) where the bullet should hit, let's say the bullet went slight to the left and it draws the tracer base on that.

The server does the same thing but has a different seed number, so in his calculations the bullet you fired went slight to the right. So, the tracer you saw didn't match where the server placed the bullet.

After the update (synced tracers):
The same thing but now both share the same seed number, that's  what changed. That means the client now calculate spread the same way the server does so it draws the tracers synced where the bullet will actually register. 


>Spread is synchronized now, so you absolutely can have no spread when standing still.

It would be a vulnerability to have an AC that works. But when it comes down to it, if valve continues to do nothing, they will lose more and more players. Which means less cases and keys and reduced market sales. Players see all the cheats and go, you know, what either they decide to cheat themselves or they just straight up quit because they can not trust the other team whether they are being honest or not. They have to do something, or the downturn of players will continue.

 Getting an AC that works should be the highest on their priority for this reason as cheaters are pushing player out of the game. So if they double down on broken VAC or get a kernel AC I don't care as long as it works and stops cheaters. They should have a development team entirely based around working on AC and security for the brand and games. If they have the team, then they should be canned and hiring people who know what they are doing. That way, it doesn't take time from the devs working on the game (bug fixes, content, and such) who probably don't know as much about the subject anyway. Valve has the money to do something, and if they don't invest it into security and AC, then I'm no longer going to invest in valve. If more players stepped up to boycott valve until they do something, I bet they would do something. I know I'm done until then.

Ofc it doesnt only come from any one country, but the main source of opium here comes from poppy plants in the middle east, and the fentanyl is mainly supplied by a Chinese pharmaceutical. I was simply stating that the US doesn't produce many of the drugs it so recklessly abuses apart from weed, alcohol, and much of its meth, but the fact it's so widely available to be imported for decades if not centuries proves that they're not the only ones with such a problem. Not just opioids, bud. Coke comes from south America, psychedelics (at least the components) are imported along with many of our pharmaceuticals, even legally. 

You're kind proving my point. It comes from all around the world, which makes it a world problem not a US one. Yes, it is that and only that: a coincidence. Don't get all conspiracy theory on me. I don't need to hear whatever point you were trying to allude to there, but I can say it has no confirmable basis. The Israeli Palestine conflict has been going on long before morphine was ever even first created. The US has a lot of less than ethical reasons to back and supply that conflict, but it has nothing to do with that. We're on a fricken video game sub. Even tho it ironically involves a vague organization of ""terrorists"" and ""counter-terroists,"" this is no place to get political. Clearly, most of this sub isn't mature enough to have an actual informed discussion on the topic as evident in this post. I was simply providing an alternate perspective of what was clearly about to be yet another America bashing thread, which I'm all for, don't get me wrong.

Now back to the topic at had, moron, it is very relevant because you keep claiming that csgo was so perfect and this and that, when csgo back in the day was also not finished or perfect. The difference here is only that the playerbase was so small no one cared and worked towards perfecting the game. 

But now come into the equation, noobs and whiny ass bitches such as yourself who think csgo was so good, and we shouldnt have left the game, and cs2 is so bad and blah blah blah when it just isnt. You are a casual, who only wants to open up cases, so go ahead, buy some more keys, and get those valuable pixels for your inventory and shut the fuck for you have no idea what you are talking about. There have been games that were in worse states after its release and cs2 compared to them is very much playable.

Kids play this game too and if one unboxes a knife then all their friends are all desperately fomoing trying to get one too. 

Spending everything they can get their hands on. I'm friends with a kid like this. He's 16. Begs me for skins and cases (which I don't give him). His friend opened some gloves about a year ago and now he's basically a gambling addict.

He does chores every week for money that he spends on cases. His PC is dying and crashes every game. His upgrade plan is opening some gloves or a knife rather than saving. 

He asks for electronic funds for birthday or Christmas from relatives so he can buy cases and keys.

IMHO his parents should be aware at that age but either they don't care or are too busy but I'm sure there are plenty of 18+ people that really can't afford it but do it out of fomo too.

Lots of people that gamble can't afford to. It's literally preying on their desperation (all gambling not just Valve).

No one gives a fuck about an adult that has disposable income having some fun. People don't like kids and poor idiots being manipulated by psychology to spend what they really shouldn't.

At least that's my take.

Not that I'm a saint... I bought thousands of cases. Held them for 3 years and sold them (likely to gamblers) for triple what I paid. I have a very nice inventory. It's worth about 5x what I put in now. All thanks to gamblers."

As the videos say, the correct way is to switch buttons from A to D or vice versa. The same moment you release one you should start pressing the other. 

If you keep pressing the key you were originally holding, then you will delay the start of your counterstrafe to whenever you decide to release it. The actual counterstrafe only start once *only* the counter-direction is pressed.

If it's just 2ms of overlap, then obviously it's not a huge deal (tho still delaying things by 2ms). But since you actually noticed that you are doing it, I suspect it's way more than that, thus likely actually having an effect on your performance.

The right thing to do in this situation is to practice the correct way and try to loose the old muscle memory as soon as possible."

Plus, I have seen people compare Phoenix and Raze to monkeys. There’s also racism towards other groups. Some person spoke in an overtly racist way mocking the Chinese language when Iso had come out. There’s a bunch of racism in these spaces, and the usage of slurs casually is still racist, but people often dismiss it as “edgy” jokes.

Even saying you’re black could net you racist responses in these spaces. I’m glad you personally haven’t heard racism, but that’s definitely not the overall experience 😅

Also, I agree more with the tech difference argument. These games don’t need high end computers for you to do really well, but the performance of a better computer definitely helps. Most black people (talking from personal experience too) will opt for a console because it’s a cheaper starting point than paying $800-$1000 for the lower bound gaming laptop or pc. The cultural difference exists because of the discrepancy in access to tech which then is just a socioeconomic issue at that point."

CS has hopefully been played as an entertainment rather then instead of learning a new skill. On evenings after work or school instead of watching a movie witch do give back more then the movie. If English isn’t your mother language you probably are better at speaking English. You could learn how to work with a team etc and put your self a side for the team which actually is my biggest learning from playing ishockey for example till I was 18.

You wouldn’t automatically pick up a schoolbook instead of launching the game, and I think you can agree on that. If not, you now has tons of time taking free courses on YouTube learning programming or anything else. Put a reminder in 2 months and go back and evaluate how many distance/evening courses you have taking after quitting cs ;)"

They can do exactly what you said and make trades with no confirmation or 2fa. You can revoke this key though and then your safe. There's lots of websites that look and act exactly like steam but it'll be 1 letter different in the url. Since it looks exactly like steam people who don't know will sign in and just give their info away. These are the 2 I see most often. I'll see a lot of the 2nd scam where they add you as a friend and then need a teammate and send you a link to sign up. That's a good example of the 2nd scam where you sign in and stuff.

Valve could easily flip a switch tomorrow and put ten free knives and gloves in every CS2 player's inventory with ultra-rare patterns and floats and immediately crash the market and there's nothing anybody could do about it, legally. (note: they wouldn't do this because it's not in their financial best interest, but they could)

The idea that your glove skin is worth $1,500 USD in cash, or that my knife drop is worth $3,500 in cash is based on the fact that there are collectors out there who will pay it. And they don't actually *own* anything but the rights to look at that skin in game while playing. 

I guess that's the biggest difference in CS versus most NFTs. You buy a monkey picture and anybody else gets the exact same experience you do for free. If you buy a CS skin you get to look at it in-game while playing and others don't.

nobody's gonna arrest you and put you in jail permanently for screenshotting a literal monkey."

Skins are nfts except they aren’t hosted on a network divested from valve, so valve essentially “controls” skins. Though of course we all have the freedom to exchange skins as we like. 

It’s unfortunate that nfts are synonymous with BAYC because they’re much more than monkey pictures. The monkey picture is marketing and branding of the company Yuga Labs, the nft is merely the fact that they exist on the blockchain. 

On top of that, BAYC (to stick to the example) is CC0 which means the company has no copyright ownership. This would be one thing you can do with your monkey picture and it’s why you see shitty burger shacks or snoop dogg’s sketchers collab. 

Valve flipping a switch can happen “any” time however what’s more likely is that your personal account is banned or items are prevented from being accessed. They wouldn’t just add more rare items for free they make too much money off cases.

CSGO to CS2 showed how reactionary the market is to change from valve. Certain skins are “ruined” because of updates despite them not being in a “final” state as indicated by valve. I even swapped some snow leopards for vice gloves near the end of beta when all vice’s looked FN. 

You point on renting items is right on target. Often with skin collectors they throw shade at valorant or other games where you just throw money at the developer. However CS is only a bit different but the money in the market gives no incentive to upset things. 

I use skins a lot to explain nfts in a gaming context. 

And to the last point they spend a lot of time looking at them because some of them don’t know how to play the game. I’ve seen some unfortunate deaths due to inspecting a skin someone just bought lol"

CS:GO skins have an intrinsic value, comparable to bonds or gold or real estate, unlike a monkey picture. There will always be a strong demand for CS skins, stabilizing their price, and including them in a well diversified portfolio is key to hedging against increasingly volatile markets."
