I have these issues as well. \n\nIf you're playing on wifi, then you should perhaps switch some of your devices off, or switch them to the other network (I.E. you usually have a 2.4GHz network and 5GHz network. You can move some of them off of one network and on to the other to save speed b/c on wifi it splits the speed between the connected devices.). \n\nAlso on wifi, it's possible your network range is waning. Switching from the 5GHz to the 2.4GHz can double your range, but make sure you aren't sharing that speed with too many devices as stated above. \n\nYour wireless network, most of them anyway, switch broadcasting channels automatically throughout the day. This happens may times, and can cause you to lag when it does this. \n\nSometimes taking the cable cord and power cord off of the modem can help reset your connection.

I deposited using ETH (I always use crypto) and normally the transaction takes at the very longest, 30 minutes. I've now been waiting over four hours and have tried contacting support. Support pretty much told me there's nothing they can do, there \"support\" staff doesn't come in for another 2 hours, and that I could contact their crypto provider, Whitepay...  It blew my mind that I would have to contact anyone out of Skin.Club.. \n\nId recommend staying away from depositing crypto, or any method. This could be a sign of bigger problems within Skin.Club. \n\nIf I never get my money it's not that big of a deal, I'm just putting this out in the community so no one gets scammed/shafted if they were going to deposit a significant amount.\n\nGood luck!",

    "text": "Hello, for some reason, every time I start the game of CS2, I get a VAC cooldown without any reason. I've already received a 24-hour VAC cooldown four times after each game, and then I took a break. When I came back, I played about three games and got banned again, but this time for 7 days. When I contacted Steam support, I told them that I\u2019m not asking to have my ban removed, but that I want to find out the cause. Their response was something like: 'We can't remove the ban you have.' I really don\u2019t understand how this is possible because I\u2019ve never cheated. I\u2019ve only been playing the game since CS2 because I could never afford a PC before, so I play pretty poorly, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason for VAC to trigger during my gameplay.\n\nI would like someone from the Valve team to review my replays and try to find out why I\u2019m getting banned. I\u2019ve never downloaded anything from Google related to Steam, and the only thing I have is the official Crosshair X bought and downloaded from steam, which I use instead of the in-game crosshair. I use the normal paid safemode, which just overlays the crosshair on my screen and doesn\u2019t modify the game, similar to an overlay on a stream or  build in monitor crosshairs. I also thought it might be due to my weak internet connection. I can\u2019t afford a strong Wi-Fi connection, so I play on mobile data with a ping of around 80+, and VAC might be detecting my movement as \"teleporting,\" maybe?\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not asking for an unban; I just want to find out why this is happening and prevent it from happening to others, including myself, in the future. Thank you.\n\nAlso, is there a better way to contact someone at Valve directly rather than through Steam support? They haven\u2019t been able to provide a proper response.\n\nIf someone from Valve is reading this, this is my Steam profile so you can check my replays:\u00a0[https://steamcommunity.com/id/OndraCZM/](https://steamcommunity.com/id/OndraCZM/)",

    "text": "Not trying to outrage bait but genuinely curious on the community's general opinion. I saw a take recently basically saying that it's the community's fault that CS2 released in a broken state because of how much pressure/demand there was for a new game. I do remember a lot of folks begging for at least a significant graphic update to the game. But I wasn't as interested in CS at the time so I can't really say how much the community was pushing for a new game. \n\nIn my opinion, it was a combination of Valorant being a serious 1:1 competitor to CS:GO as well as community pressure. At face-value, Valorant undoubtedly looked like the better game just from a graphical standpoint. Of course it's not fair to compare a brand new game to a game released 10 years ago but that's what the competitive/tac FPS community did until CS2 released. We all agree CS2 released unfinished and there's certainly plenty that could've been done by now to improve the game (128 tick, operation when???, etc). \n\nI still think Valve would've still kept the game at 64 sub-tick regardless. But the game would've been a lot more polished at release. I think Valve unknowingly did more damage to the game and community by trying to compete with Valorant immediately rather than cooking for a bit longer. If the game had released at the end of this year (2024) I think the hype for the game would've remained for a lot longer. Instead, people were super excited for CS2 until they realized the game was purely a graphical improvement at the cost of breaking nearly every staple mechanic the previous game had perfected (surfing, b-hopping, boosting, you name it).",

And that's how most major companies operate now. Maximize profit with the least amount of work possible.\n\nMy theory on subtick is that 64 subtick is Valve attempting to compromise. Normal 64 tick too dated for a modern game plus community hates it, 128 tick cuts into profit too much, creating 64 subtick is more expensive than keeping 64 tick but cheaper than implementing 128 tick. Plus as you can see, developing a \"new technology\" allowed Valve to say ridiculous things like 64 subtick potentially being just as good or BETTER than 128 tick.",

If he is serious about counterstrike, you should tell him to start playing faceit instead of premier. Furthermore it\u2019d be great to get him some league play experience, maybe some of his friends would be interested in starting a 5 man team just for the experience, there are plenty of leagues open to all skill levels. If he is serious, I\u2019m sure he already knows about these resources but he should also be practicing on prefire maps, practicing spray control+transfers, and memorizing utility lineups. These will fast track him to improving as a player, and mastering these will especially improve the impact he has on a team of randoms and allow him to rise the ranks without a full stack.

But right now, it's a lot more developed, as I started to add more tier 2 events and the female scene too, we reach +2000 players listed.\n\n*Processing img o87nu6tvdynd1...*\n\nWith this document, you can focus on the position you like or you want to learn how to play, select and compare players, go to HLTV and get some more information on statistics if you want, but the document has already the best performances with their position tagged, so it's just a matter of downloading the demo, watch the POV and learn everything you can from the pros.\n\nMy goal here is to share with the community a document (database) to improve, but also, it has some scouting potential too. I'm getting very comfy on the names, players, positions/roles of each. So it's a good work for me and I will came up with a Conclussion Study to publish, finishing with all the teams structures available and comparing all to understand all the ways that teams are structuring themselves on each map. Because let me tell you that there are some really interesting builds and a lot of different approaches.\n\nHere is the document: [**CSdex 2.1**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h2VmcRZxf_zKE6dr2ysdNVh40Zl3ydSxu_o8gsikGk4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI try to update daily. But sometimes it's beyond me. So right now just trying to catch up to date by Friday and keep going. I'm looking to reach +5000 entries after ESL Pro League Season 20 ends. So if you want, add the database to your bookmarks.\n\nEnjoy and share it if you like it. Thanks for reading.",

Some other chinese player in my team (Player B) said he is weak because he wasnt using any hacks. All of sudden, player A was spamming some kind of cheat commands in the chatbox and all i noticed was my teammate started to kill each other and get banned? I think there were remotely controlled into killing each other because they called him weak. Damn, this is my first time ever seeing this, i think there is this cheat that makes u lose control of urself and u shoot ur teammates until u are banned. (Sorry for my bad english but this cheat is wild and I really had to show this to you. I was lucky to surrender before getting controlled by his commands so I did not get a chance to see if that is the case.",

After 2 players got kicked in the team due to teamkill ban, the 3rd player in my team started to automatically follow me and aim at my head and shoot in a weird way (as if he was being controlled his crosshair was locking to my head)\n4.

        "body": "Hey there. Level 9 Faceit here - 20.7k Premier, LEM on GO - I went ahead and reviewed your demo, here's my honest opinion on things - \n\nInconsistency - You're a very inconsistent player, it's actually super strange. You kind of have the skillset of somebody who learned how to do things to a very basic degree, but never actually took the time to get those things down solid. (This will get brought up a good amount)\n\nAIM - Definitely needs improvement. It's not what I'd consider awful, but it's definitely not GREAT either. You're inconsistent when it comes to hitting shots, peeking, and crosshair placement. I'd say to not go on AIMLABS because that shit is trash, just grind out some DM, 1v1 Arenas, or some Aimbotz or something. It's better to actually aim train in the game you're trying to improve at than to aim train in some external app / game.\n\n??? - You do A LOT of extra stuff that you really do not need to be doing? A lot of random nades with no info, a lot of random pre-fires or shooting through smokes with no info, just a bunch of weird things you should just completely cut out of your gameplay. It's pointless, getting you nowhere, and giving away your position. (((Stay the fuck away from smokes man, you're not stewie2k. You try to be. A lot. Stop it.)))\n\nGame Sense - You ignore a bunch of random basic corners and angles you should be checking, leading you to getting knifed at one point. Although it may get annoying, you NEED to be checking all of the angles that somebody could be hiding in, especially on a rotate. Your inconsistent when it comes to reading the enemy team. You'll go from reading them perfectly to being lost to reading them okay to being lost to reading them perfect again. I think you doubt yourself a lot, just trust your gut, you actually seem to kind of know what you're doing sometimes.\n\nMovement - Back to what I said about inconsistency - Your movement for the MOST part is, to be honest, kind of mediocre, even kind of bad - but you sometimes do pretty good jumps or hops, then turn around and go back to having MEH movement. I'd recommend hopping into some basic KZ maps and getting that movement down, but you lack the fundamentals tbh. (Jiggle Peeking, Peeking, Timings on jumps, etc)\n\nPositioning / Repositioning - Your original positioning isn't terrible, but when you back off from what you were holding and go to re-position a lot of the time you leave yourself hanging, or you take out your knife, or you just position yourself in a way that isn't that great. You don't really take advantage of the fact that you have teammates, and you hold angles they're already holding, or you ignore a lot of angles that you SHOULD be holding instead which leads to you getting flanked or your enemies flanked from an angle that you should have been holding.\n\nTeamwork - You don't do a lot of trades, you kind of bait, and you really don't use your team efficiently. What I mean by this is - a lot of the time you play like you actually forget you have teammates and try to do a LOT of things by yourself that lead to you dying a pointless death. You also don't really play with or off your team too much, you sort of go solo and do your own thing which ends up with you losing the round. \n\nReaction Time - To be quite frank, A LOT of your deaths (and I mean a lot) come from you simply having a pretty slow reaction time man. You react VERY slowly to a lot of people peeking you, and I believe this is what you mean by \"as soon as I peek, the enemy player is ready to rip me a new butthole\" - It's not that they're ready for you, it's just that to you it looks that way because you react so slow, but truthfully from them peeking you (or you peeking them), to you dying, quite a bit of time passes.\n\nTo Summarize - You're super inconsistent, your aim isn't great, your movement isn't great, your game sense is inconsistent, your positioning / repositioning isn't too good, your teamwork is pretty bad, and your reaction time seems to be pretty bad. I truthfully don't have many good things to say, I mean you seem to know a decent amount of pop flashes and peeks and stuff, but that's about it. I'm honestly surprised that you were holding level 7 because you do kinda play like a level 4-5 player. \n\nNo worries though, these are ALL things that can be improved, I'm more than down to sit in a Discord call with you and go over some demos and sort of coach you until you get better. I currently do this with a few people.\n\nDiscord is dee.0888 if you're interested (free of course, no charge.)\n\nP.S. - Sorry if I sound like a dick, but when you're asking for help and opinions on gameplay, the honest truth is best.",

Premier is MUCH easier than Faceit.\n\n\"I literally don\u2019t want to get to the point of burn out because of me being a shitter\" - I promise you the things you need to improve are things you can and will see improvement on extremely quickly, if not immediately - no need to get upset or burnt out over bad performance.\n\n\"in terms of kz, I could surprise you honestly\" - You probably could, but knowing how to do complicated and extremely skilled KZ related jumps is cool, but when your actual fundamental & basic movement itself is lacking it's a bit weird lol.\n\n\"Ive watched too much pro league stuff and I\u2019ve picked up some complicated stuff from their plays, but I\u2019m not pro\" - I started out watching nothing but Pro Demos, Tournaments, and Scrims - Then I would (and still do) go to higher level Twitch streamers and watch and study their gameplay. It's definitely not a bad thing, but trying to implement higher skilled players stuff into your own gameplay when you're not ready for it can definitely backfire.\n\n\"I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ve basically gone a jack of trades kind of thing where I try to do everything, but I\u2019m shit at it all\" - It's definitely not bad to be a \"jack of trades\" - a LOT of people are, in fact, at higher Faceit levels, most people can do any role, and play super good at it, but if you're not good at ONE of them, you shouldn't focus on playing ALL of them. Find your playstyle and get really good at it, then look toward branching out.",

I suggest practicing with bots to get down the mechanics on shooting. Learn about timing off spawn (basically knowing what parts of the map you are able to take before the enemy appear). Learn about how to peak angles and having your crosshairs at neck/head level at all times. Sound is very important learn how to hear your opponent coming and learn where to not make sound so your opponent doesn\u2019t see you coming. Cs has a lot of elements to it, watching guides on YouTube is a great way to get started because there is so much to learn about the complexity of cs.

Or is it disabled in Csgo specifically unless you circumvent this restriction using specific hardware/code? \n\nMy family pc with a $20 keyboard used to do that as whenever I played RTS games and games like Gmod, I\u2019d hold down one direction constantly and spam another to wiggle the camera, and I do the same on my current pc\u2026 So is it game specific and does Csgo nullify both inputs if it detects two at a time?

Since I always got distracted looking at my scoreboard position, radar etc, I even made a config for it. I have this in my autoexec:\n\n    alias \"dm_on\" \u00a0 \"cl_draw_only_deathnotices 1; cl_drawhud_force_deathnotices -1; unbind TAB; bind o +showscores; bind l dm; alias dm dm_off; echo dm_on; bind n say ns;\"\n    alias \"dm_off\" \u00a0\"exec autoexec; alias dm dm_on; echo dm_off;\"\n    alias \"dm\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"dm_on;\"\n\nThis makes it so by just typing \"dm\" in console, I can toggle the *entire* hud. This means I am literally playing with nothing but my crosshair on screen. No radar, no killfeed, no health, no ammo stats. Just me and the enemy. \n\nThe best way to play DM imo is to focus on something you want to improve and train for that. In my case for example, I always struggle with first bullet accuracy. So I just get an AK+Deagle and spend the entire DM just trying to tap on peoples heads. I don't care about my KD, I only care about my HSP. If I don't hit 95+% headshots, I wasn't accurate enough.",

Some stats that say that as much as 30/40% of cs community is cheating and looking at how many videos on youtube or discord servers you can find it doesnt seem too far from the truth. i really cant play a game without thinking about the enemy cheating now and will probably quit the game until there is at least a response from valve about the issue.

My team always seems to have a rage hacker and so does the opponent. They literally discuss cheats in the game chat and dont care about getting banned. (which they seem to be getting frequently I have seen people getting banned within 1 week of rage hacking which is better than  before). But the frequency is off the charts. \n\nI can assure that I am not doing a rant cause I am 'so bad' because I tried faceits and never found a single rage hacker period. That seems to be a matchmaking specific issue.\n\nFor context my region is India.\n\nIs this common in other regions? Is this a new occurance? IIRC the incidence of rage hackers was 1-2 times in 10 games at worst in global games. Rn matchmaking is unplayable for me and I have kinda high ping on faceit,\n\n",

Now, we have SEA players who have taken over indian servers, and seeing a player like that pretty much guarantees a horrible game. Not saying all sea are cheater, but you get my drift. Quality cs feels like a pipedream now unfortunately. We have a group of very good players, and we usually play 5v5 lobbies to avoid this issue.",

Not necessarily bad I just assume that's not desired. On that same note all of the T entrances are very close together, standing at A main I would not be surprised if you could hear B main. I would make one of the main entrances come into the opposite side of the site cause right now the T rotations seem really fast since the both mains have a mid connecter right at them. This can cause issues also for how easy it would be for ct's to shut off the map if they get mid control and then control of the connectors. Just some quick thoughts I get from looking feel free to ask me for clarification or to update with changes.

The game requires an cpu with 3D V-Cache in order for u to have decent 0.1%lows.\n\nUr game feels like 60hz with decent FPS & Hertz ? Yep. Bad 0.1%lows.\n\nUr game stutters when shooting or geting shoot? Yep. Bad 0.1%lows.\n\n# Another Issue: Frametimes\n\nFrametime is, technically, how long it takes to render a frame. In the real world this also translates to how long each frame is on your screen.\n\n[Frametimes going from 2ms to 6+ms](https://preview.redd.it/3i54bwq1vvmd1.png?width=1348&format=png&auto=webp&s=53f46bad41a0272416c4aea61fe467bd5296d013)\n\nIve tried other Fps games on the market and at the same fps the frametimes are considerably lower compared to CS2. Riot fps as an example has the frametimes always below 3.0ms, even during high action scenes.\n\nSince most of the csgo>cs2 update was graphics related, whats causing the game to require such an strong CPU?\n\nIs it Subtick?\n\nBad coding due to them mergin code from 3 games ? (CSGO,Dota 2,Half-Life:Alyx)\n\nIs valve going to adress the performance issues any soon? Can we get a dev to tell us this is an acknowledged problem and wont be ignored?",

This laptop gets 30-45 fps on all low with fsr on quality at 1080p(lower settings dont really seem to help).\n\nI used to get stable ping back home which was around 15-50.

Mobile data is better but it's still not stable (gives around 50ms),spikes quite a lot. \n\nI now have a different desk which is smaller, have a much smaller desk pad now. Still have the same mouse luckily. \n\nIt's just frustrating as shit to play now, because I can't do shit in games which I was pretty decent in my old system (12k in premiere which is low, but I feel like now it should be 3k rank coz of this). \n\nNeed help please smh, I dont feel like playing coz of this shit, but really want to.

    "text": "I played CSGO from like 2015 to 2019 and collected a total of 6000 hours on game, was good at it and then stopped playing. I tried it once like a year or two ago and the first thing i noticed is, nobody uses voice chat like they used to. The most fun thing about CSGO was talking with 4 other strangers and making tactics and plays. When i queued up for competive game, 2 guys were speaking russian, other two didnt speak at all and enemies were russian basically, also toxicity was very high. I quit after two games. Also i know its CS2 now and some stuff changed (like competitive is not played to 16 round wins but 13 which is BS). Is it worth returning to the game? Is it still the same as it was 10 years ago? (Experience wise, not gameplay obivously)",

    "text": "So as the title says CS2 all of a sudden now crashes on my Steam Deck whenever I load into a map where it didn\u2019t used to recently. \n\nSo for awhile now, I\u2019ve been bringing my Steam Deck places where I don\u2019t have internet, but I do have a like desktop setup just using the deck as a desktop. Now in the past I noticed if you run the deck in its normal mode and not desktop mode and try to run cs2 it just never launches properly. But if you run it in desktop mode it\u2019s perfectly playable and in fact better than my i7 7th gen/1050 laptop. Or it was. \n\nWhenever they added the snap tap update I think, now my game crashes whenever I load into a map. And this sucks because I\u2019d been using this time to practice smokes/do prefire maps and aim training maps, and now I can\u2019t.\n\nWhat happens is I open a map, and it loads, I choose a team and spawn. I wait about 10 seconds and it starts lagging and then hard crashes. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s causing it and I\u2019m curious to know if it\u2019s a me problem or something the most recent update did. So if anybody has a deck could you try this? ",

However, cheating is not that big of a problem for casual players (the average ranks) since there are much fewer cheaters here relatively speaking. Also i am really confident that it will only get better in the future, as valve irons out the game. \n\nCS is not going anywhere and Valve is in it for the long haul, because its one of their biggest long term successes.   \n  \nFaceIt is a third-party anticheat driver similar to vanguard from valorant if you are comfortable with running such software just to play a video game, that could help reduce the number of cheaters you will encounter but it certainly will not eliminate them either.",

        "body": "I'd say there's a lot, back in GO I got curious and went through my match history and the farter back I went the vac bans there were. Past 6 months about 30% of matches had at least one player vac banned, I didn't bother to calculate multiple bans. Some were players I'd reported, some weren't sus at all, a couple were people I'd played with for years and never suspected. The big problem with the cheating issue is that unless they are raging there's no way to know for sure and it's that doubt that festers and makes things worse and worse. \n\nThat low hour account with no skins might be a new player that just got insanely lucky and hit headshot after headshot without letting up on w for the rounds that mattered and wont hit another headshot this week, or maybe they are trying to be sneaky and toggling for the clutch. During the match you'll have no way to know and reviewing demos is wasting more time on top of the time wasted in the match that you lost and might have got cheated on. It's the doubt that makes things worse and leads to hackusations left and right and untill Volvo get serious about AC it's gonna continue.\n\n I've been running into guys that rage in casual to win when there's literally no stakes about once or twice a week, guys that are closet cheating daily. If casual is this bad then I'm sure ranked is infested. Got no clue about my trust factor, but ive never had it come up when partying with people tho so I guess it's green?",

API scam has kinda become a catch all people are (incorrectly) using to describe any inventory hijack. But it was a specific scam where a malicious actor would get ahold of your API key, use it to monitor for trades, cancel the legit trade and send a duplicate trade from a different account. So it was redirecting trades and had nothing to do with your actual account being compromised. API scams worked without them needing access to your account. \n\nSo if you\u2019re gonna call someone stupid you should at least know what you\u2019re talking about first.",

I am not playing to be pro, I don\u2019t see a point in progression now either because I hit level 10, and recently it feels as if I play just to play rather than to have fun and enjoy it. The game feels much less enjoyable now anyways where I strictly play against the top 5k guys in NA. I have also invested a lot of my time into the game recently which now I feel to be a waste of time, and I want to play more single player games and focus on real life things. I guess I am just writing this for confirmation since its pretty obvious I will at least take a long break from this game, and other competitive fps games in general.

The deagle can one shot kill just like the awp, but requires far more skill to consistently hit the head, hence the cheap price.\n\nThe REAL ISSUE is that the current loss bonus system is not optimized for MR 12, it's optimized for MR 15, so we are getting less gun rounds and less gun rounds with awps. Valve really needs to rework the loss bonus system and money system in general. Maybe increasing cash rewards for completing objectives like defusing bombs, planting bombs, getting kills etc can be increased.",

Then going for consistent entries is a good idea. However that's not always the case.\n\nSince I am regularly disappointed by my teammates nade knowledge, I usually tend to be the guy who throws most of the execute utility for the team. In games where that is part of my role, I usually keep the entry attempts to two types of situations: Ones where I have a good spawn (like long Dust2) or situations where the rest of my team is busy shitting themselves instead of pushing.\n\nAt least in lower ranks, as long as your teammates aren't completely incompetent and you are good with util, setting up teammates for entries is often more valuable than forcing everything yourself.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying to avoid entrying.

Unfortunately there is no way to manually drop your rank so you will just have to keep playing until you are against people equal to your skill. \n\nOtherwise what you could also do is Que up with people at the rank you should be at/ or just lower ranks (can\u2019t be too big of a difference, I think it\u2019s roughly 2 colour types - elo colour - difference) and it should match you against roughly the average of your team. \n\nHope this helps \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc",

Because of it, Titan was effectively banned from participating in this event because they didnt have enough time to find a 5th.

There was another team I think it was epsilon who also had a similar situation with a player named emilio I think. Thus you can find souvenirs with those sticker in a gold foil version on them but they\u2019re like pretty rare.

        "body": "Due to Valve's unique and unregulated approach to skins, the community has assigned crazy values to in-game cosmetics to the point they're less gaming cosmetics and more investment NFTs that you can play with in-game as a bonus functionality. There are people whose job (part-time or even full-time) is trading these skins in the same fashion as one might buy and sell stocks on the stock market. \n\nValve has never assigned a specific price to any gun skin, so there's no 1st-party guidance whatsoever on their price. Its entirely down to what the community subconsciously thinks its worth through an open market system. \n\nThe Karambit is that expensive because the people who buy it believe its worth that much and are willing (and have) paid for it at that price. And yes, they do pay 4k USD for a Karambit Fade. A large part in their perceived value is that although you may have bought it for 4k USD, a year later it may be worth even more money when you sell it (because the buyers then are willing to pay even more for it), so you could play with it for a year and even make money on top of that. The knock-on effect of this, of course, is that some skins have lost their point as in-game cosmetics and are bought only as investments to sit forever in some businessman's inventory, never to actually be used for their original purpose. \n\n[The most expensive skin ever sold was recently sold for >1 million USD. ](https://gamerant.com/counter-strike-2-rare-expensive-skin-ak-47-blue-gem-case-hardened-cs2/#:~:text=After%20years%20of%20being%20steeped,buyer%20on%20June%205%2C%202024)",

One taps feel like a 50/50 now, even though on paper I have a very good counter strafing percentage. And it\u2019s not even while just moving. I find myself standing absolutely still and behind an enemy player with a dead nuts headshot and still somehow magically miss. \n\nI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m the best player in the world by any means. A faceit 7 even asked me if I was a 10 in an Anubis match yesterday, but in fact I\u2019m just a washed LE from CSGO \ud83d\ude02\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me or something with the game. But it\u2019s like any consistency with my ability to hit shots round after round is dead. One round I can headshot ace the entire team, the next round I feel like my aim is dead on and magically get dinked by the bottom frag with a pistol. \n\nImo faceit shoulda kept CSGO servers\u2026 \n\n\nThat\u2019s just me, I know tons of people think it was time to put CSGO to death. I don\u2019t necessarily disagree, but valve should\u2019ve atleast established subtick and the anti cheat as being competitively viable. \n\n\nInstead we\u2019re left with the mess that is CS2,\n\u201cWhat you see is what you get\u201d\nPffff",

Followed by being body blocked by said random shit heel, who then gets mad at me for not giving up mid because they bought awp.  All that did was start a fun fight over who had mid.  And I gotta tell ya, once someone starts being toxic, the main goal of the game is to upset them more.  Winning is secondary.  So I went mid every round. Win or lose, I sure as fuck wasn't giving up my spot because some asshat bought an awp.  Got my kills, body blocked the shit out of him, caught a few reports from his buddies I'm sure.  Still ended up on top though, pissed him off, and won the game anyways, even with the few thrown rounds just to hear him scream more.

And teamplay is much more important than individual skill.\n\nOf course, if you have five prime s1mples in one team, you dont need any communication hahah but us mortals still have to rely on playing as a unit as much as possible.",

Like sure, you'll notice the difference, but it's not as big of a step up. \n\nI'd say, if you have only have your one 144hz monitor right now, then getting a new monitor might be worth it, just to get a second monitor in general. And if you're gonna get a new monitor, might as well make it an upgrade to your main monitor. \n\nHowever I would not recommend buying purely it in hopes of it making you better at the game.",

The only closest experience i can think of is playing search and destroy on cod. I\u2019m pretty good at cod with over 10,000 hours over many consoles, however i have never touched kbm, so i am a bit scared to make this switch. And from what gameplay ive seen, this game is nothing like cod. I am just dying to try something new as ive been playing cod basically my whole life, and at this point the game is in a horrible state. My budget is around $2500 nzd (around $1500 usd). I have a Acer 180hz monitor that is pretty good for my ps5, but would I need a new monitor if I were to have a PC? overall im just pretty confused about PCs in general as ive never owned one. pls help lol",

But even after buying prime ppl still face a lot of cheaters in premier due to bad anti-cheat by valve . Its not a small amount (1200rs) so was a bit on and off about I should buy it or not as it will be my parent's money that I will be spending(i am a student right now).  \nI know this post got a bit long but pls share ur opinions .\n\n// Peace//",

I had premier back in csgo when it was a free thing to sign up for, and then it became paid. I probably only seen two completely blatent spin bots in my thousands of hours and on leetify only a handful of players have been banned from my past matches and those were usually on my team walling and not being super obvious so it was hard to tell if they were just having a good game. Maybe try it without and see if you run into blatent hack and if you do buy it",

    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been thinking about buying a CSGO knife for a while now, but I\u2019m struggling to decide which one to go for. \ud83d\ude05 I'm working with a pretty low budget, around \u20ac100-120, so that\u2019s definitely a factor in my decision.\n\nHere are the options I\u2019m considering:\n\n1. **Ursus Knife**: I like the look of this knife, and it\u2019s pretty affordable. However, the animation is a bit boring, which makes me hesitant.\n\n2. **Stiletto**: This one looks awesome, but it\u2019s way out of my budget, so it\u2019s probably not an option for me.\n\n3. **Nomad Knife**: I find the animation really cool. However, it\u2019s tough to find this knife in good condition at a reasonable price, and with worn-out skins, it just doesn\u2019t look great, especially with certain glove combinations.\n\n4. **Survival Knife**: This knife doesn\u2019t have any particularly cool animations, but you can get it in really good condition for a reasonable price.\n\nThese are just some options I\u2019ve been considering, but I\u2019m open to other suggestions if you have any! So here\u2019s my question: Should I go for a knife with a better condition and less exciting animation (like the Ursus or Survival Knife)? Or should I stretch for something with a cooler animation, like the Nomad Knife, even if it means settling for a really bad skin?\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate your opinions and advice! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThanks in advance!

Outside of your picks though, I\u2019d look into getting a Bowie Freehand tho if you can widen your budget a bit. Field tested is 135 euros on a buy order. It\u2019s a large and pretty knife, you can spin it by spamming FR and it\u2019s got 2 hands just like every other knife.",

        "body": "Generally I'd say warming up doesn't take more than 5-15 min. I often just hop into one DM, try to go for headshot taps only and then I'm ready for the first match. Since for CS you don't really need to physically warm up your body, it's really just about getting your head in the game. You can of course play warmup stuff like DM, aimbotz etc for longer than that, but at that point it becomes practice instead of warmup. \n\nAs for how to deal with tilt when things are not going your way, I do have some stuff that helps me, but man, I sure struggle with that too :/\n\n* In comp matches try to get invested into the *team's* performance instead of your own. When you die, don't get annoyed at yourself or the enemy or whatever, try to continue helping your team. In CS2 you almost never have a full team of 5 people that actually use their mics. So when you're dead, communicate for your teammates.\n* Learn utility. Sometimes I just have a really off day. I can't hit my shots, I'm not getting any good timings etc. But one thing you can *always* do is throw a learned smoke lineup. By now I know all the nades for a full execute for both sites on every map I play. So if I'm having a day where the \"Me go kill\" strat just isn't viable, then I can essentially just throw the util for the entire team and set them up for success.\n* Instead of getting annoyed at dying or not getting that kill, think about *WHY* you didn't get that kill. Sure, sometimes the answer will be \"they were just faster\" or \"I missed\". But a lot of the time, a slight change in your positioning would have given you the advantage. Really try to use your mistakes to learn instead of giving into them. Also consider if the tilt is making you make mistakes. Sometimes you keep making the same play, cause it worked so well in previous games, but in this one it costs you over and over. This stuff *can* be hard to spot in the moment. But keep it in mind. If something isn't working right now, try something else instead.\n* If all else fails, your team is useless, you can't hit anything and the world is just miserable, listen to dumb music. You die, you click unpause and listen to \"[Pedro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzilCu9PcZk)\" on loop till the next round starts. While I get tilted easily, just having some good vibes throughout the game can often cancel out my bad mental in a bad game.",

And it makes sense why not to tell exact % of matches being watched by the new system and it wouldn't make much of a difference if they told the players, matchmaking is a diceroll anyway but it's still could be an advantage for cheat makers I suppose. \n\nI also later on the day checked if it was some or limited, it's for latter (so it's limited testing), could have edited the comment or delete it entirely it really doesn't matter now, and it's just really venting ass comment on my part (clarifying it to avoid calling yours one).\n\nJust really frustrated how valve handled the game and replaced a fully working one with a somewhat working game them knowing how the game will look like and play like and with some dumb decisions made into the mix. Cheating sure still would be a problem, but at least there was overwatch to handle some cheaters and get them banned. And yeah the canceling of a match is nice that's great that would have been a great feature for csgo and it is a nicer feature in cs2, but being put into matches with blatant cheaters and not getting that canned sucks.",

Given the luxury and entertainment options available in the city, it might come as a surprise to many that traditional casinos are actually banned.\n\nHowever, Dubai still offers a wide range of legal and exciting alternatives for entertainment that align with the local laws and cultural values. From world-class horse racing events to luxury resorts with exclusive offerings, there\u2019s plenty to explore if you\u2019re interested in the scene but want to stay on the right side of the law.\n\nFor those interested in learning more, I\u2019ve put together a comprehensive guide on my site, meacasinos.com, where I dive into the specifics of UAE gambling laws, explore legal entertainment options, and provide tips for tourists. Check it out if you\u2019re planning a trip or just want to know more about the region\u2019s unique approach to gambling.",

There are a few newer players, and a couple guys & gals who\u2019ve played for 5-15 years.\n\nWe\u2019ve been having fun teaching the greenies, so all skill levels are certainly welcome. Trash talk is cool too, no limit on sprays\u2014 express yourself.\n\nI have all of the default maps in rotation, including a few gag & arena (cs\\_bloodstrike anyone?) maps\u2014 some of which my friend has made for us.\n\nWould love to get some tournaments set up were we to get a solid 20-30 regular players.\n\nSince most of us are in the US, playtimes are anywhere from 8am - 4am mst (tech layoffs are brutal this year, unemployment = more gaming while we can).\n\nWe typically chat through our discord server while playing, but joining that isn\u2019t a requirement.\n\nIf you\u2019re keen, feel free to message me.\n\n(Bonus if you play Halo, we host matches for that as well).\n\nCheers \ud83c\udf7b",

One of them mentioned I probably had to download and open the game for the first time for them to appear in my inventory- so I did that and nothing.\n\nI then checked my market history on Steam and they were like grouped listen on separate days. Like a bunch of 25 December (Which shocks me the most since I don't spend time on my computer on Christmas), a group on 3rd of December. So I have no clue at all what happened. I'm not too upset since I didn't have the greatest skins but I'm more concerned about where the money they sold for went.\n\nWas this just like an automatic thing that happens if you didn't play cs2 for over a certain amount of time? I mean its not even like just my skins are gone, my cases too lmao.",

So last I played was like 1-2 years ago, played back up to LEM. Now I started playing CS2 just the other day, and my rank on the maps I've gotten ranked on is in the Silver range? I'm stomping every game and seeing my teammates run and gun aiming at the ground it doesn't really feel like I belong here. Is this because of decay due to inactivity? Was there a rank reset for CS2 and everyone got placed in silver or something? This just feels *weird*",

Putting the objective in a building but the rest of the map being very open is something that would never be done today. The basement dock/boat is incredibly tough to navigate through. The map is completely asynchronous, and theoretically could be cheesed (anyone who played the casual demolition mode knows about the guy in the toilet until time ended), but it plays very fun.",

        "body": "I honestly don't know but I'd guess direct port. T side sometimes gets a little hung up on the framed house at start and the bot behavior is particularly bad - CT bots always go behind the rocks and never head towards the house unless the bomb gets planted. T bots play ok though. It feels very 1-1 but every so often you think \"I've made that hop 10,000 times before... why did I hang?\" Exiting the turret window overlooking CT spawn seems much easier than it used to.\n\nI did a couple bot \"casual\" games on it and it was a solid approximation. They added some pool floats to the water, otherwise visually it looks exactly the same.",

Meaning all you have to do is apply classic password cracking software and be done with it. No need to send wrong pins off to the steam servers. However, it seems like steam updated the feature over the years s.t. while entering pins offline they show an error (probably because a request is sent off to steam servers which never arrives) while still being able to validate them internally though. To verify this is how it works i would need to do a bit of packet scanning which i am frankly to lazy to do rn just to win an arbitrary debate with someone who hasnt even hacked before apparently.\n\nIf family view were an actual security feature steam would tell you so. They dont. Because its not.  \nFamily view is obfuscation and a defence against script kiddies as well as your own kids, nothing more.\n\nThe only way it would pass as an actual security feature was if it ONLY worked while online and validated each attempt against steam servers. This way a timeout could actually be enforced. Since this is apparently not how it works, it also does not pass as real security.",

My interpretation of this is: steam can validate the code offline but does not actually want you to know that, hence each validation still sends out a request to the steamservers which throws an error if it cant reach them. This appears to only be visual though and not actually an enforced mechanism.\n\nFrom a design perspective this makes total sense, because if it required a connection enabling family view would by default disable any offline use of steam, which as per its faq  it is not intending to do.\n\nKnowing this, a dedicated attacker could now investigate further to find where and how steam is able to validate the code without accessing steams servers and use that validating string (likely its just a hash of the pin) and throw one of the many tools for such purposes at them. Considering the pin is usually around 4 or so digits, it would take barely any time to then crack locally.\n\nHowever, many \"hackers\" out there are just script kiddies and a measure such as family view could still protect you from them, because realistically they dont actually know a lot about hacking (yet).",

Just tried and yea that\u2019s definitely the case because I was able to unlock my library. So for that I stand corrected and apologise.\n\nI also don\u2019t understand why steam wouldn\u2019t require email confirmation to disable family view in the first place.\n\nBut I do agree with what you originally said in that the best protection is just being vigilant in where you sign in. At the end of the day I don\u2019t think family view really causes any harm and it might just be an extra step in making someone give up trying to access your shit.\n\nEdit: there does seem to be some kind of rate limiting still though even in offline mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9rbfuqbfwlld1.jpeg?width=536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e4c44f4ecb59de986ab505f1b1460796dcc8335\n\nBut considering it\u2019s offline there might be a way around it I dunno, I\u2019m definitely not smart enough to figure that out",

I got the awp graphite with help from my best friend at the time who's since passed away & there's so much sentimental value in that skin because of that. Is there any way I can find that exact skin/who owns it so I can try to buy it back? I know steam don't restore skins, especially after so long so figure this is my only shot at getting it back",

I don\u2019t have an account anymore. Sure, I could just create a new one and buy Prime, but for some reason, I really care about badges like the 5 Year Operation Coin and other Badges.\n\nStarting from scratch with a brand-new Steam account with 0 hours and no games feels pretty crappy. I\u2019ve even considered buying an account, which my friends and I have done in the past. I know it\u2019s against the ToS, but honestly, I\u2019m more worried about the possibility that the account might stop working randomly. While I\u2019m okay with losing the account itself, I\u2019m concerned that any skins I put on it would be gone forever if something happened.\n\nIt\u2019s a complicated situation, and I\u2019m really not sure what the best course of action is. I\u2019d appreciate any advice you guys could give me.\n\n^(Thanks!)",

Insults are just for jokes). Good money, fast retirement, you get home for free (depending on country), easy path in career (I recommend joining something like Officer School after finishing you get straight a Second Lieutenant rank).\n\nIts just good job. I mean yeah it has lot of working out and hard work but if you sont mind hard work its much better than working at factory\n\n\nOnly con is food. I never ate worse shit in my life. But maybe its just like that in Poland. I bet Italians get fancy shit to eat. Like idk. spaghetti, salad, garlic bread and chicken breast with vegies. I mean they care about what kids eat in school so they have to about army for sure. Food in Polish army looks like cat would ate it and vomited it and then ate it again and returned it again.",

Csfloat is player 2 player tho so when u have a buyer u will do the trade nobody will request ur ak-47. That's wat makes it great vs scams is the seller makes the trade not a bot that can be impersonated by a scammer.",

    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently came across some disturbing news about a patent filed by Activision that could negatively impact the gameplay experience of skilled players in multiplayer titles. The patent reportedly includes things like reducing aim assist and lowering damage output for players who are performing too well. It\u2019s a system designed to artificially level the playing field by directly interfering with the player's experience.\n\nThis got me thinking: could Valve be doing something similar in Counter-Strike 2?\n\nWe\u2019ve all experienced those moments in CS2 where things just don\u2019t add up\u2014shots that should hit miss, or it feels like your damage output isn\u2019t matching your aim. It\u2019s easy to chalk this up to lag or bad luck, but after hearing about Activision's patent, I can't help but wonder if something more deliberate might be at play.\n\nWhat if Valve is using the netcode to subtly tweak your gameplay without you realizing it? Given how complex netcode can be, it would be easy to hide things like dynamic accuracy adjustment or hidden damage scaling. Plus, with the VAC Net system already analyzing gameplay data in real-time, it wouldn't be a stretch to think that it could also be used to \"balance\" matches by adjusting mechanics for certain players.\n\nI'm not saying this is definitely happening, but the idea isn't that far-fetched given what we\u2019re seeing in the industry. Plus, Valve has been pretty secretive about the intricacies of CS2's matchmaking and gameplay mechanics.\n\nWould love to hear what you all think. Has anyone else felt like their gameplay is being tampered with? Or do you think Valve would never go down this route?\n\nLet\u2019s discuss!\n\n**TL;DR:** Activision filed a patent to manipulate gameplay for skilled players. Could Valve be hiding similar manipulations behind netcode or as part of the VAC Net system in CS2? Have you noticed any weird gameplay inconsistencies?",

I can understand that cheating in online pvp might feel powerful and fun at first but doesn't it destroy the fun and challenge of the game quickly? \n\nIt's the same with Escape from Tarkov for example. Dying and losing most of your gear is PART OF THE GAME, it's what makes EFT special and fun at all, learning from the own mistakes, just beeing unlucky or whatever.

The far left is just as bad as the far right. But that's still not an excuse for this stuff in counter-strike. I get that there's a lot of young people who think n-word = funny/edgy/anti-woke is cool!. A lot of them probably aren't doing it with hatred, but it's still going to make whoever is the butt of the \"joke\" feel unwanted, singled out, and targeted simply because of the color of their skin or heritage. That's textbook racism. And it also encourages the true racists to come out of the woodwork and say some really deplorable stuff on mic.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNeither one of us has the answers, but I'm glad that you're willing to see things from someone else's perspective.

You only play against the braindead cheaters. If someone is good and also uses cheats. its really hard to spot them.

In that case 220 ain't fast, but it's not to bad either. (cause ingame 220ms time to damage pretty much means you're walling).\n\nThe issue is your crosshair placement. You are actively making things hard for yourself by always aiming right at the corners. Having the crosshair on head *height* is one thing, but you also need to anticipate the enemy movement. The vast majority of the time they aren't gonna do the most shallow peek possible. Instead they'll either wideswing or do something in between.\n\nTo accommodate that, put your crosshair 20-100 ingame centimeters away from the corner (how far depends on the specific angle you're holding). That way they just run into your crosshair.\n\nIn this clip, you need to flick to hit every single one of those shots. While it looks cool, it's not very reliable and not very fast. Focus on learning how far away from the corner you need to hold with your reaction time, as it's a bit different for everyone.\n\n(For me it's usually \\~50cm early round, when people tend to wideswing a lot and \\~20cm in a clutch when opponents are more likely to be sneaking around the map)",

Really? It's just common sense that we know PC performs better, and better cooling doesn't always equate to more frames. This isn't a general rule of thumb, you thermal throttle at a certain degree and you can mitigate that on laptops in many many ways. \n\nUpgradability, my guy are you new to this? We also know PCs can be upgraded. But for OPs needs, storage can be swapped, RAM can be swapped in most cases unless soldered, and then again, what do you need RAM for CS?? \n\nPortability? So you are considering the fact OP might need it for school, uni, work and he moves around a lot? Or travels or whatever? \n\nCost? Yes? Give me a setup, hell a cheap setup, that costs as much as a laptop that runs cs at 60 frames. That's all am asking lol. Cause I know laptops that cost 200 dollars that run CS at 60 frames. Good luck finding a PC that runs it at that much. \n\nYou keep saying desktops are more cost-effective, they are when you have money to spare, they are when you are comparing a 1000-2000 dollar desktop to a 1000-2000 laptop. Every single time you will get a better PC. But you forget to look at OP's reasons. Maybe he is tight on money? Maybe he doesn't like PCs? Maybe he needs to move a lot? \n\nIt's insane to tell someone to get a PC when they are specifically asking for a laptop. And a cheap one at it. Clearly tight on money. \n\nNo amount of ChatGPT is going to make you right, I build PCs for a living lmao. I'm not an advocate of laptops, though however, I'm an advocate of common sense.",

The folder they were in was called *test* and had a folder called *cards* \\[creation date 08.14.24} in it, which the videos were located in. The \"cards\" are saved in a rather weird ratio (almost square). There are 10 of them saved by the name of \"card\\_x.webm\". They look like their intended use was being a background for something, as they are able to be looped perfectly. (maybe the MVP bar?) One of the biggest reason I think it would be a background for that, is because it simply doesn't have use anywhere else (we already have \"miniprofiles\" and shit), they are also too small to be displayed as the main menu background.\n\n[The cards, located in directory listed at the end.](https://preview.redd.it/idv3m445ykkd1.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe5d63b0dd2ba8de64ac9176b8fe69ff5db07d7c)\n\nRest of the videos in the videos folder were videos from operations, intro for CS2 as well as a couple other things (trailers etc.).

    "text": "Counter-Strike 2 is not just about sharp shooting and quick reflexes; it's also about mastering the intricacies of the maps and understanding crucial callouts. Whether you\u2019re a novice eager to learn the ropes or a seasoned player looking to refine your skills, understanding map guides and callouts is essential for success. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into effective strategies for map navigation, key callouts, and how to leverage these skills to dominate your matches. Plus, if you\u2019re looking to enhance your gaming experience, we\u2019ll also touch on where you can find quality Counter-Strike 2 accounts to elevate your gameplay.  \nUnderstanding the Basics of Map Guides\n\n* **Bomb Sites**: Knowing the exact locations and layouts of the bomb sites is crucial. Practice navigating to these sites quickly and efficiently.\n\n* **Choke Points**: Areas where the map narrows, making it easier for defenders to hold their ground. Common examples include narrow corridors and doorways.\n\n* **High Ground and Low Ground**: Elevation can offer strategic advantages. High ground usually provides better sightlines, while low ground might offer cover or concealment.\n\nEssential Callouts: Communicating Like a Pro\n\n* **Bomb Sites**: Sites are typically referred to as \"A\" and \"B\". Make sure to use these terms consistently to avoid confusion.\n\n* **Choke Points**: Terms like \"Mid\" (middle), \"Long\", and \"Short\" describe key areas. Knowing these can help you communicate enemy positions effectively.\n\n* **Common Locations**: Terms such as \"Pit\", \"Car\", \"Tree\", and \"Arch\" refer to specific spots within a map. These terms help your team understand where you\u2019re looking or where enemies might be hiding.\n\n* **Be Clear and Concise**: Use brief, precise terms to avoid miscommunication. For instance, instead of saying, \u201cThere\u2019s an enemy near the corner by the crates,\u201d you could say, \u201cEnemy at Car.\u201d\n\n* **Update Information Regularly**: Keep your team informed of enemy movements and positions as they change. This helps your team adjust strategies dynamically.\n\n* **Coordinate with Your Team**: Ensure that all team members use the same callouts to maintain consistency. Agree on terms before the match starts if necessary.\n\nLeveraging Your Skills with the Right Account\n\n* **Trusted Source**: [Waytomsurf.com](http://Waytomsurf.com) offers reliable and secure accounts for Counter-Strike 2, ensuring a smooth and safe transaction.\n\n* **Variety of Options**: Whether you\u2019re looking for high-ranked accounts or ones with specific achievements, [Waytomsurf.com](http://Waytomsurf.com) provides a range of options to suit your needs.\n\n* **Competitive Edge**: Buying an account from [Waytomsurf.com](http://Waytomsurf.com) can give you a head start by providing access to advanced features and high-ranking positions that would take time to achieve on your own.\n\nConclusion  \nx  \nIn Counter-Strike 2, each map is a carefully designed battlefield with its own unique layout and features. Mastery of a map means more than knowing where the bomb sites are; it involves understanding the terrain, key chokepoints, and optimal strategies for both attacking and defending.  \n**1. Learn the Map Layout**  \nThe first step in mastering a map is to familiarize yourself with its layout. This includes knowing the location of key areas like bomb sites, choke points, and high-traffic zones. Spend time in practice mode or watch detailed map guides to get a visual sense of the map's flow. Pay attention to areas where players frequently encounter each other and understand how these areas interconnect.  \n**2. Identify Key Areas and Sightlines**  \nEach map features critical areas that can be pivotal to the outcome of a match. These include:  \n**3. Practice Map Control**  \nControl of the map is often the deciding factor in a match. Work on controlling key areas and cutting off enemy movement. Communication with your team is vital here; coordinated efforts to hold or contest important map sections can significantly impact the outcome of a game.  \nEffective communication can make the difference between victory and defeat. Callouts are standardized terms used to quickly convey information about the map. Mastering these callouts is crucial for efficient team coordination.  \n**1. Standard Callouts**  \n**2. Using Callouts Effectively**  \n**3. Practice Makes Perfect**  \nIncorporate callouts into your practice sessions. Use custom maps designed for practicing callouts or play with friends who can help reinforce the correct terminology and usage.  \nHaving a solid understanding of maps and callouts will significantly improve your gameplay, but having the right account can also enhance your overall experience.

Map Updates**\n\nEpisode 9 Act 2 features updates to several existing maps, including:\n\n* **Bind**: The introduction of new teleportation points and changes to the layout of key areas provide fresh strategies for both attackers and defenders.\n* **Haven**: Adjustments to the layout of bomb sites and defensive positions offer new tactical options and require a rethinking of traditional strategies.\n\nThese map updates aim to keep gameplay dynamic and encourage players to adapt to new scenarios.\n\n**3.

Does anyone know any solutions on how to get more/stable fps or is it just my specs? Btw i tested fps on benchmark map from workshop and the results were same for 1280 and 1024 resolutions.

        "body": "fps is normal for the setup. The only thing you should try to improve is frametime. Resolution isnt always the fps changer, because whatever you try you end up either gpu bound or cpu bound. And neither are much better than the other to give more advantage, if that makes sense.\n\nOne should first play around with different graphical setting, different max fps limit to find better frametimes. In CS2 lowest isnt always the best for some reason.\n\nThe best thing you can do is get a new CPU. You can just plop in a 5700x3d and it will give better fps but also much better lows and frametime. It is a very worthwhile upgrade for gamin if you have the means and truly care about good gaming FPS. If you have a better CPU you can benefit more from less graphical settings as you get more CPU bound and it can handle it.\n\n1660s is on the cusp of being outdated but can still hang on. CPU is holding u back a bit more for games like CS2.\n\nHowever if you dont have the means to upgrade right now the best thing you can do is play around with settings to find a good stable frametime which will be the best thing one can do right now. Obviously also making sure to \"de-bloat\" your system as much as possible wil help as well. Running a lean Win setup whilst gaming can help etc etc. One can also try Linux, for some games and setups can give better frametime and smoother experience.",

        "body": "the F2P danger zone update caused millions and millions more item drops due to all the new F2P accounts, which caused the price of dropped items to sharply decrease. Valve was very confident that their new vacnet and trust factor system would be all that was necessary to keep bad actors out of prime matchmaking in their new fully free to play model. but this wasn't exactly true.\n\nso 2-3 years ago, they significantly rolled back the F2P update. you can still play the game for free, but you aren't able to play competitive ranked matchmaking, let alone in prime matchmaking. you can't receive drops as a free to play player either. you must buy a prime account upgrade for the full game, just like before the danger zone update. F2P accounts are now like really elaborate free trial accounts.\n\nwith the F2P drops gone and locked behind a niche prime account upgrade DLC, there are many many times less free drops than there were a few years ago. at the same time, a shit ton of people are playing! F2P players still love to gamble and open crates as much as prime players do. so these days there is an insane demand for crates, yet far less supply than there used to be. free drop items have been on the up and up for the last few years, cases that used to be worthless .03 cent crap are now 30 to 50 cents, cases that used to be ten cents get you a dollar, and the extra rare crates that used to go for a few dozen bucks are now an absolue jackpot.\n\nand we can't forget CS2 hype. the community was absolutely shitting itself to death over the new game, and the skin market became a huge speculative bubble with people investing while skins were \"low\" and expecting them to go high. because clearly source 2 meant that gaben himself would descend from the heavens and make counter strike the most played game in the entire world right? so items skyrocketed in the leadup to CS2. obviously, CS2 did not end up as the second coming of christ, and the absolute insanity of CS2's launch died down a bit. but gambling addicts will still be chasing that high for years to come, a hype train like that was a multi-billion injection into the skin market. so skins are still quite expensive even now, when everyone can't help but complain how shitty CS2 is and they can't help but keep buying skins anyways.\n\nTL;DR: the game was F2P for a few years, case drops flooded the market. item drops got removed from F2P accounts and can now only be obtained from legacy accounts or from niche prime account upgrade DLC buyers, yet all the new F2P players are still around buying cases. supply dries up, demand continues to increase. throw in an insane CS2 hype train turning the skin market into a speculative bubble, and prices skyrocket all around.",

I just said this clip itself is really not proof when it's pretty easy to cut context and make things that aren't sus LOOK sus. Don't believe me? Give me some of your match demo codes, I'll make shorts that LOOK like you are cheating.\n\nMy constant rhetoric is that people seem to think everyone is cheating nowadays even at the silver level and it's making silver hell even MORE hell (see my other comments about how people ruin matches just because they assume someone is cheating). It's really not that hard to figure out that it's WAYYYY different than pretending no one is cheaters. I literally already left you another reply acknowledging that I know it's way worse at higher skill levels. Hell even the cheaters in question here got RIGHT OUT OF SILVER when they started cheating. Cheaters in silver at least in my region are actually rare.\n\nThe game is not random to me. As I like to put it I've got game sense and no aim sense. I suck at aiming and BARELY run the game at 20-30 fps nowadays (actually can't run it at ALL right now cause my GPU shit the bed) but I literally came into this game because I got interested in the pro scene and the friend who helped teach me the game was literally a global. Lost interest to learn it to the point of pixel perfect smokes or anything on that level, my bad for trying to HAVE FUN. Didn't realize that meant I apparently was incapable of knowing what was going on at all. Good to learn that from the guy who clearly CANT EVEN READ PROPERLY.\n\n\"But skilled players can recognise when someone with this level of skill overall, does micro adjustments before a peak and micro snaps with 0.2 second reaction time, and 1 second later is starting at the ground.\"\n\nWhat's funny is I thought the micro-adjustment as the first guy walked out actually looked like a soft aimlock (Oh but you thought it was just because of walls, I guess I must be wrong there too?), I just wanted plenty of proof before I just talked like it was certain because unlike you I prefer actually looking into things properly instead of making an arse of myself (again, if your gonna cyber stalk someone, learn how to read properly. It'll help you not look stupid). Mind you I had not yet seen the leetify page, let alone the match demo at that time. My bad for wanting more evidence than a 24 second clip to be certain even though clearly I was far from the only one.\n\n\"So you have like 1 year of comments saying people aren\u2019t cheating and you\u2019re a silver?\"\n\nWow even after I point it out you wanna be purposefully obtuse. Yes for awhile I argued with someone WHO IS ALSO IN SILVER that not everyone is cheating like he claimed and the only way he could be facing even NEARLY a fraction of the amount of cheaters he claimed is if he had ruined his trust factor acting like a petulant child in game like he does on the subreddits. Dude is literally a running joke around these subreddits at this point because of his schizo like posts. But yeah all I do is defend cheaters, that's why you had to ignore comments like this one during your little sad crusade through my profile to pretend you had a point. Literally one of my most recent ones. It's just sad man.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rqcuk1qtxikd1.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2a70fa0bbbcd198656c44b45d2f1ea5a18d1831",

For reference around a week ago I was playing with a 3000dpi at around 2.47 in game sens, as I realize that was crazy high and my accuracy proved that, I can't seem to get a sens that doesn't A. Hurt my wrist or B. Feel extremely too slow. I understand it takes time but I wanna make sure that the sens I stick with will be worth getting used to. My question is, is there a map I can run to get a good idea for? When I go to 800 with 1 sens I feel way to slow and can track at all in aim labs.",

While he does record actual sales you still should be wary about the AI pricing tool. All I'm saying is don't blindly believe everything you see. Blue gem owners are notorious for only reporting high sales and are extremely secretive about low sales. For example, the Stattrak Factory New AK-47 661 was sold for an \"undisclosed price\". Also be careful of recorded sales cause often times high tier items are used for balance transfers from sites like buff. Again, just be careful with what people want to make you believe. CH knives are incredibly illiquid. On CSfloat you can check to see how often items trade hands. You'll see a lot of CH items sit for sale for a long time....",

I think we all knew that when cs2 was released, it was not polished, and about a year later, whether you'd like to admit it or not, this still rings true. This was supposed to feel like an incremental update with better graphics, but instead it feels like a completely different game. From the movement to the spraying in some aspects, to just how it feels in general. I really do hope that for the 1 year anniversary for cs2, Valve releases some huge update. Valve kicking the playerbase off of csgo into cs2 would only be understandable if cs2 was polished, but this hasn't been the case, and might still not be for another year. Hopefully not though. You know it's bad when you have CS YouTubers STILL complaining. Maybe this post is a duplicate of all the other people complaining, but that's how most of this subreddit feels. From people posting them getting shot behind walls, to fps issues, to people mad about the lack of updates, to the cheaters. It's just the majority opinion, and hopefully soon Valve can change that and make this the definitive, perfect counter strike game we all loved.",

The game registers when you click even inbetween ticks, however the action of you shooting and killing an enemy can only happen at a full tick. So the game calculates if you were clicking when your crosshair was on the enemy and if you were, you get a kill. This leads to sometimes you killing an enemy when your crosshair isn\u2018t even on them - but that is not the problem here. You DIE behind walls because of the same reason. When your enemy clicked when he saw you and the tick only ends when you are behind cover visually you will still die even if you are supposedly behind cover. That is because the calculation is happening instant but the action at the end of a tick. In GO that was not a problem because the action of shooting and hit registration was only calculated at the end of ticks, so even if your enemy clicked when he saw you, if you were not in his crosshair at the end of the tick he didn\u2018t get a kill.",

However, a key limitation of the controller is that it only has one joystick, restricting Alex to either moving or aiming at any given time. Switching from moving to aiming involves letting go of the joystick and then sipping or puffing into a separate straw to toggle the functionality. Now, Alex is able to use the Link in combination with his Quadstick to move and aim simultaneously, unlocking a more intuitive gameplay experience.\" \n\nSource: [https://neuralink.com/blog/prime-study-progress-update-second-participant/](https://neuralink.com/blog/prime-study-progress-update-second-participant/)",

    "text": "I've been running into a really frustrating situation in Deathmatch recently, and I'm hoping to hear if anyone else has been dealing with the same thing\u2014or better yet, has a solution.\n\nI've noticed a growing number of AFK bots that join the game, immediately start spinning in place, and shoot anyone who happens to cross their line of sight. It\u2019s pretty clear that these bots are being run by people who want to farm accounts to level 10 quickly. They then sell these accounts to cheaters, who can jump straight into Premier matchmaking without having to grind their way up.\n\nThe kicker is that even though the account buyers still have to pay, this tactic helps them bypass one of the main bottlenecks that\u2019s supposed to prevent banned cheaters from easily coming back with new accounts.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that whenever I try to start a votekick to get rid of these bots, it fails. And then, almost like clockwork, some random player\u2014who doesn\u2019t seem affiliated with the bots\u2014starts a votekick on me instead. Despite trying to explain the situation in chat, I end up getting kicked instead of the bots. This has happened multiple times, and it's really disheartening.\n\nIt feels like there's not much I can do to stop this. We all know that if some popular CS YouTuber made a video about this issue, everyone would suddenly be on board with kicking these bots. But until that happens, I\u2019m just sitting here, watching cheaters level new accounts right in front of my eyes and feeling completely powerless to stop it.\n\nIs anyone else dealing with this?",

Completely normal sign up for faceit from the actual website, however I had my steam open and periodically checked the authorized devices.\n\nAfter signing up they invited me to a legit looking hub which had another vetting process which involved signing into steam to verify something. I was mildly intoxicated so I did the sign up process without checking the URL. The only thing that saved me was when I double checked the authorized devices again and saw a samsung phone from russia had access to my account.\n\nI clicked \"remove all credentials\" on steam, double checked if anything was changed, took note of what was in my inventory, and changed my password. Is there anything else I should do? ",

    "text": "I want to share my problem with you and maybe find solution. Lately I'm experiencing significant FPS drops when I play CS2. Especially at Inferno problem is visible. Changing video settings does not affect FPS at all, so I assume it is cpu problem. But when I play I feel like cs is not using full potential of my CPU. CPU usage visible at task menager is about 40%, and temps are only a bit higher than in idle. Maybe someone will have idea how to fix it.\n\nCPU: I7 10700kf  \nmboard: Gigabyte z490 vision g  \nGPU: RXT 3070TI  \nmem: 32GB 3200MHz",

It sounds more like keyboards up till now have been stuck in one mode, and this alternative mode is now available, and it's clearly better for fast-pace games.\n\nOne can imagine a situation where the first button pressed (let's say A) should take priority.  The next button (D) won't trigger until I release A.  But... as we see in fast games the opposite can be more valuable.  Even if A is in the process of being triggered, if D comes into play it now has priority.  It's just changing the mechanism by which the keys are triggered.\n\nDipping a bit into hyperbole, this is like old school players complaining in hockey or baseball that people were introducing gloves because it might offer them an unfair advantage.

So it will be the same but undetectable. The same other HW providers.

        "body": "3 months ago I got so paranoid at my current keyboard I switched to a standard dell keyboard from a computer rig as old as windows xp. Why? Because I looked at the website for the keyboard I had and it physically changed its information in front of my eyes every time I refreshed. It was supposed to be really nice, brown switches or whatever, but had an extended usb input in the back, which when I got the keyboard before I started playing CS I was like \"cool I can plug a mic or keyboard in\". I ended up smashing that keyboard to bits because I thought it probably wasn't a fair keyboard to play with. The brand name was \"viper\" and it was basically a \"ghost\" keyboard (no information anywhere about it after looking). I had a \"friend\" (that changed) drop it off with his PC at my house which I ended up buying off him because he went through a psychosis (I recently did too) and dropped/sold me his PC equipment off at the house I was living at. The keyboard being a \"ghost\" is something I didn't think about until I actually started playing cs2, because games were not as important to me until I feel in love with CS. It was laggier than the old dell keyboard I tested and switched too which bothered me a lot. Aside from that i just didnt look into it much and switched to the old dell keyboard right away after that. It could have been normal, I just didn't want to become a mechanical engineer to solve whether the keyboard was fair game or not. It had 2 USB inputs which I thought was just for the extra USB input it had behind it but I really think it wasn't a fair keyboard because of the lag it introduced compared to a keyboard from literally windows XP. I never noticed anything in game where behavior was different than what a normal keyboard would have. I wouldn't be able to know for sure though, I'm just a human being. I also worry about the DeathAdder v3 I bought recently. Especially the 8k polling rate. It sounds like a disadvantage at first with less frames and the cpu being hit by that high polling rate. At that point it's basically pulling components out and being a hardware and software engineer though. And I'm just wanting to be a player in the game.",

I only went with wooting because they\u2019re ahead of the game by years in the hall-effect market with speed and innovation, also because the build quality and materials are really nice, but ultimately drunkdeers a good purchase for sure.",

Im not sure what the right answer is I just wanted to mention the other features as IMHO they are just as important as snap tap and shit, I don't really care either way as Snap Tap only reduced my performance due to learning a different counterstrafe timing. If people are gonna complain about Snap Tap they should complain about all the other extra features too. And valve should make an official statement saying things like instant key-resetting and customizable actuation points are allowed, then it will for sure be in the same category as say monitor refresh rate and not in a grey area.

    "text": "Idk if this is news to this sub or not but just saw a post about some guy losing a billion skins. Thought I\u2019d share this as it happened to me just last night. \n\nGoogle \u201cdmarket\u201d and theres a sponsored result that literally shows \u201cwww.dmarket.com\u201d\n\nClicking it takes you to some stupid link. I don\u2019t get how google ads work so I don\u2019t get how it\u2019s possible to display the legit link and redirect me to the spoof site \n\nNevertheless I actually fell for this and they almost got me. I logged in with my steam user and password. I know that\u2019s not how any of these sites usually work (you usually just auth with steam and never enter your login info) but I just wasn\u2019t really paying attention. I typed \u201cdmarket\u201d and hit enter expecting it to just take me there but guess I cleared my history recently. I was on autopilot cause wanted to quickly look something up. \n\nI got a text from steam asking me to disable my Authenticator and the site asked for the code. \n\nThat\u2019s when I realised I just got pwned. Thankfully stopped right there and didn\u2019t turn off my steam guard lmao. Changed my password immediately, I should be good? Idk, don\u2019t be dumb like me. Also report these ads ",

Imagine having both a physical pin and a redeemable code for an in-game genuine pin, or even just the redeemable code for the in-game pin. It would be a fantastic souvenir to commemorate attending such a prestigious event.\n\nIs this something the community would be excited about?\n\n**Note:** I understand that CS has other pressing issues that need attention, and cosmetic 'money grabs' shouldn't be a top priority. However, considering that Valve already introduces new cosmetics like stickers and coins for each major, I think this could be a really awesome addition for attendees.\n\nApologies if this has been suggested before. Thanks for taking the time to read!",

Renting beyond a single week just so you can use/see skins is incredibly stupid.  Are people actually doing this?  No way, I can\u2019t believe anyone is giving valve close to $150 a year to loan skins that they have no ownership/stake of\u2026. Please tell me you are not doing this.  \n\nRenting is almost NEVER a better option than owning, with basically anything.  House/Apt., car, appliances, etc\u2026. Only if renting makes sense because committing to a purchase (long term like mortgage) isn\u2019t feasible or desirable due to situations in life.  (Renting as a college student makes sense.  Renting as a financially stable adult with a career and the ability to buy a home/apt is incredibly stupid.  I paid rent when i lived in Manhattan for 5 years.  Fucking $3k a month for a one bedroom apt.  Nearly $40k a year, $200k over 5 years and I got NOTHING out of it today.  When I was finally able afford buying a place I did it immediately.  And now the couple thousand I pay every month on my mortgage, it technically stays with me (grows actually because the value of the property is increasing) because I\u2019m going to eventually own the house.  In 25 years I can continue living here without paying a cent to anyone, or I can sell it, get back all the money plus a lot more (rising real estate) that I paid to liv there 30 years, and buy another home in full with cash up front.  \n\nNever ever rent shit unless it is the ONLY option or it actually makes sense due to situational reasons.",

I believe in grace, i believe no one can be truly \"good\" without Jesus, i believe no one deserves heaven, but by Gods love, by his grace we receive life and eternal life in heaven, by having him in us and by obeying his commends, and the God that is in us which is the Holly Ghost one of the trinity, God is one, but he has 3 personalities, 3 positions, The Ghost or Spirit is a gift, after the death of Jesus, after the old testament where God was around us and not in us, a spirit that changes us from the inside out, that convinces us of good and evil, right and wrong, the only way we can be good, and im humane i felt like the guy was shitting on me so i shat on him, do i have to manipulate people?because they are gonna feel pride and good that they are doing something for someone so called \"good\".

I wont be responding anymore, nor looking at anything, be inside your buble, thinking that your right, alway right, like a peacock that for vanity has wings but does not fly, and eats on the dirty ground.

I'm one of those guys that change sensitivity a lot.\n\nI just can't decide what is really comfortable for me and which one I want to keep playing on.\n\nIt's a lot better now than it had been in the past (in the past I used to change sensitivity a couple times through the match etc.).\n\nNow I have **2** sensitivities I want to choose from.\n\n1. **600** eDPI (\\~70 cm/360)\n\n2. **900** eDPI (\\~45 cm/360)\n\nThe first one (**600** eDPI) is more comfortable for me when shooting and the second one (**900** eDPI) is more comfortable in terms of movement (also the lowest one to comfortably do **180** on the average size mousepad (45 cm).\n\nNothing in between doesn't convince me cuz let's say I set it to **700**/**800**. I still can't do **180** in 1 swipe (from the center of the mousepad to the edge) so I'd rather just set it to **600**.\n\nI can't decide cuz I like having low sens (crosshair smoothness, better aiming, greater margin of error) but on the other hand I like having my sens high enough to do **180s** in 1 swipe and **900** eDPI allows me to do ones.\n\n**Here comes my question - which one would you choose and why?**",
