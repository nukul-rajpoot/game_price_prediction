1560399148,2019-06-13,279 Congratulations bro and thanks for the giveaway. My story: Got a Spectrum case drop which was around 10$. Converted them to keys. After a while like around a month I got a USP with Clan Mystik Holo for 1 key. Sold it for 11 keys. So I basically made 0 investment to 60keys that time. I was around 1 and half year ago.

1563183188,2019-07-15,"TLDR: * Player numbers are through the roof for CS:GO, so demand for everything is high * BFK have an animation that is preferred by a lot of players over other knives * Most BFK are coming from a Breakout Case which is a rare drop for 2+ years now, so supply of new knives is limited * BFK knives are in Spectrum cases, but it is 1/6 chance to get this type of knife, and even so they are from more expensive patterns. S1 is already a rare drop, S2 will in 1-2 months become a rare drop too which will further limit supply. * Breakout Case cost 0,17 USD and despite that people are opening it like crazy. The purchase data from steam market for Breakout Case and Breakout Keys are insane for a case that is a rare drop for 2+ years",0.129,0.832,0.039,-0.8846,13
