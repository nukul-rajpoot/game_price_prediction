It is enough if you have one alias to buy the gun of the same slot on both sides. Simply use `buy ak47` to buy an AK-47 or a M4A4 or a M4A1-S, according to what you have equipped. Same goes for `buy tec9` which buys a Tec-9 or a FiveSeveN or a CZ57-Auto. Or `buy galil` which buys either a Galil AR or a FAMAS. Or `buy mac10` which also works to buy a MP-9 on CT side.

It should be obvious because `buy m4a1` automatically buys an M4A4 or a M4A1-Silenced (when on CT side, on T side it buys an AK47), depending on which type you have equipped. If it wasn't that way, `buy ak47; buy m4a1` would not buy anything if the M4A1-S is in your loadout.
