Lets take Titan vs NAVI for example. Both are top notch teams, with large amount of success and upsets. But ohwait, lets look at the odds. 22% for NAVI? Outrageous. What a player new to betting thinks - ""ok, titan has 78%, that's a safe bet, i'll bet my electric hive and get a moderate payout"" What I think - ""ok, Navi has 22%, is a top notch team and with odds that good, I'll bet moderate items and get a great payout!"" Think about it for a minute and it makes sense when 2 top 10 teams clash together and one has odds that small. Especially in BO1. Second of all, never go #yolo bets when you haven't built up a proper inventory and have A LOT of items to spare, because one wrong yolo bet and you can lose. Third of all, always bet on nip.

1407462982,2014-08-08,"Hi guys, as requested, I'll be doing the text commentary for this game. GL and HF :) **Pre-Game** An incredible imbalance of odds here has Exertus at 84% on CSGO lounge, and many here believe that Reliable, off the back of a few strong performances, is possible of causing an upset. The map will be de_inferno, which is CT sided. Therefore it is pivotal that whoever finds themselves on the CT side first holds their angles strongly and doesn't give up sloppy frags. In contrast, Terrorists will need to get ultra aggressive in the first half in order to force mistakes from the CT side. While Exertus outaim Reliable, inferno is a map that is about strategy, with dozens of different strategies, smokes and site-takes available for both teams to use on the T side. The winner will undoubtedly be the team who executed site-takes best on the T side. We await the knife round, which should be in 5-10 minutes as we currently await the stream to go live. **Pre-Game (cont.)** The CEVO countdown ends and the CEVO advertisement plays, giving everyone in chat a raging boner. The cry for DUDUDUStorm - Sandrude comes out, and it looks like it's going to be a riot here from chat. How could this affect the game? Only time will tell. **K - K** The knife round begins. Storm pulls out a sexy looking Huntsman | Night at T spawn, and all players rush mid. Abe baits hard, Warden spins his butterfly knife as Xp3 and desi get some blade kills down mid. Abe gets rek'd in a 2v1, and XTS will take the knife round and pick the CT side. **Exertus (CT) vs Reliable (T)** **0 - 0** Exertus on CT, Reliable on T. Big pistol round coming up here. What can reliable bring to the table in round one? **0 - 1** A conventional 3 A 2B play from XTS. A fast rush to A site from reliable. Mark picks up a frag but Warden trades him out as lightworked kills TM to make it a 4v3 situation for the T side. Warden grabs an extra 2 kills after the bomb goes down but robby gets a frag to make it a 2v2. Robby goes down to Warden but lightworker grabs a quick double to win the round for reliable. **0 - 2** XTS buy a swag 7 and a few CZs, they're going for this round. Three T players move up mid, and it looks like it's going to be an A-take. Three CT players sit in aps, and dink SuperLex and finishes him off at the top of mid. Abe trades him out through boiler as three Ts move to library. Warden tries to wrap up behind the Ts but the distance fall off on the mag7 doesn't allow a kill. Lightworker kills warden, and TM trades out mark. Robby takes out XP3 at library, leaving desi in a 1v3. Desi kills lightworked, and binks abe. However he has to save the 5-7 he bought. He kills Robby and saves his armour and weapon, but the round is lost. **0 - 3** A more conventional eco round coming out here from XTS, as Storm gets boosted to Diggity hut. Reliable moves 3 men up banana. Robby sprays down both of XTS' players at banana, and the B-take is complete. Superlex gets the man on the rotate at banana. It's a 2v5 situation here for XTS and it looks like they want to go for exit frags. A simple round overall for reliable. Warden goes down to mark and the Ts will escape safely. Storm goes down last minute to make it a perfect round for Reliable. **1 - 3** 10 rifles between the two sides. This round is pivotal. Four men and the bomb move up nana for Reliable and TM eats a grenade to go down to 58 HP. Desi grabs a great double at A but mark picks up a double at B to take the B site. It's a 3v2 situation here for XTS, as two push through con. Lightworker sits newbox and mark sits dark spot, but Warden and TM grab two quick kills and defuse the bomb. Solid re-take from Exertus to win the first gun round, but the bomb plant allows reliable to buy again next round. **1 - 4** XTS loses the B site again as lightworker and abe grab frags.. Abe sprays the smoke through to CT for another frag, but gets traded out. TM gets stuck in construction, and robby finishes him off the win the round for reliable, who are looking really solid. **2 - 4** Mark grabs a convincing kill from T-carps to apartments, giving an early advantage to reliable. It's an eco round for XTS, and desi gets a great headshot onto robby, who survives with 12HP. It's going to be an A-take here, as reliable moves over to Arch. Xp3 and storm get kills from Pit at A site, and desi grabs a headshot kill. Bomb goes down but it's a 1v2 for relaible. Xp3 takes out Mark, and it's an eco-win there for XTS. **3 - 4** That round went down way too quickly, reliable opting for a smokey-sort of rush to B. Xp3 gets a good kill before being traded out, but desi activated beast mode for a quick few frags and put the round into the favour of XTS. They clean up and win the round. **4 - 4** storm gets a double, TM gets a double and warden picks up the last kill as reliable rush A site on the eco. comfortable for XTS who are starting to hit a stride. **5 - 4** reliable on the eco again, their economy sucking due to XTS' eco win. Desi drops the bomb from nana while spraying T stairs. It's a 4v2 situation here, robby moves to smoke the B site but desi drops him with a slick headshot. TM picks up superlex and it's a 5-4 lead for XTS. **6 - 4** It looks like there will be a set play on the A site here as Reliable move four men up mid and alt-mid. Warden tries to spray through smoke and BARELY misses, but no damage goes down. 50 seconds on the clock and reliable are playing slowly. Reliable begins the push. Abe picks up a frag at Diggity but warden trades out superlex. Robby trades warden but storm grabs a great double from pit. Robby says ""anything you can do, I can do better"" and gets a sick double. Xp3 takes out lightworked and taps defuse to bait robby, takes him out with a jumping headshot and saves XTS' ass. Great play from the young man. **7 - 4** desi gets mark at nana with a hasty spray down, bringing it to a 5v4 for the CT side. but the T side takes control of banana and it looks like it will be a set play on B. The roatet comes out from the A site so reliable will need to be quick. Desi and XP3 grab a good kill at B site each but it is TM on the rotate who grabs a neat double kill to clean up and win the round for XTS. **8 - 4** Reliables attempts to storm and rush banana but gets stopped by an incendiary nade, and then a smoke. They move back to mid and alt mid. Reliable on a force buy here with the bonus money. Limited grenades. Reliable moves back towards B but desi waits at coils. He combines with Xp3 and they grab a double each to make it a 5 v 1. Abe is going to save his AK, his tail between his legs at T-carps, and XTS wins the round convincingly. **9 - 4** Reliable buys CZs to accompany Abe's AK, and Abe gets taken out at second mif by an aggressive Warden peek. Lots of damage goes down and it's down to mark. He grabs a double from pit, but goes down with only 4 HP. The damage is done but it's too late to impact XTS' economy. 2 men left on the CT side as XTS picks up the round. **9 - 5** Robby picks up an awp kill, and superlex has an awp also. Reliable is attempting to get super aggressive with these scoped weapons, coming out with a hail mary of sorts. 5v4 advantage for the terrorists here. Reliable moves towards A, and XTS rotates quickly. TM gets a kill from pit but gets killed by fire. Terrorists get some quick kills to bring it to a 3v1, and XP3 gets a single frag and nearly holds the clock to timeout, but gets fragged with moments remaining. Reliable picks up the round, albeit nervously. **10 - 5** Desi gets taken out by an UNREAL headshot at banana, but nothing eventuates. TM gets a trade out kill, before superlex gets a pick at apartments to hand reliable the advantage once more. Reliable moves up banana, and it's going to be 4vs1 on the B site. The rotate comes in, but it's warden's amazing triple kill from behind barrels on B site that wins the round for XTS. **HALF TIME. XTS (10) leading Reliable (5)** This game could go either way, a balanced first half here, but a lot of importance is placed upon the pistol round here. **XTS (T) vs Reliable (CT)** **10 - 6** The pistol round begins. Superlex and robby take damage from a nade. However, this pales in comparison to the damage dealt to XTS here. It's still a 5v5 however and it's going to be a push onto the B site. Mark gets a great double kill from coils, and XTS move back to A. Robby and lightworker kill storm and warden respectively, bringing it to a 5v1 here. TM has little chance here, and is eventually cleaned up by lightworked. Great hold from reliable. **10 - 7** Two Famas, a swag7 and an M4A1s come on the CT side here. A few CZs and P250s appear on XTS. It looks like they're going to be pushing T side, Lightworker grabs a double from coils, and another two kills, giving him 4 kills before storm takes him out. Storm gets the plant before being shut down, giving XTS a much-needed money bonus despite the round loss. **11 - 7** XTS buys up here on the T side. Reliable push up onto B with no smokes. Mark gets a frag from a boosted position, but XTS take the advantage with two quick kills and the bomb plant. The swag, and famas are still on the CT side, and they'll be saving their weapons along with an awp on Lex, giving XTS a good round win. **11 - 8** Robby shits all over everyone in apartments, getting 2 easy kills, with 2 other kills coming in from a swag7. Xp3 trades out with a double. It's a 1vs3 situation, pretty tough here for Xp3, who's going to move towards B, where only one CT awaits. If he can get the kill here, he may be able to plant. However, lightworker rotates to CT and gets a solid headshot onto xp3 the moment he moves towards the B site, giving reliable a convincing win. **11 - 9** Giving my fingers a rest, but reliable wins the round in solid fashion. **11 - 10** save round for XTS, who get just one frag. Warden saves once more. Reliable looking great here. **12 - 10** Three men push up banana so the A site is free. Mark grabs one frag but it doesn't match the kills that came out earlier in the round from Warden and Xp3(?). The bomb goes down on A and it's a 3man retake for reliable against 4 XTS players. Two site in pit, one in apartments and one in diggity. It's gonna be a save from reliable, and XTS take the round. Abe stuffs up some aim for exit frags, and only gets one before being taken out. **12 - 11** Desi deals some damage to Superlex but gets dropped to 34 HP at the top of mid. Lex misses an awp shot at Apartments, but it doesn't matter because abe gets 3 great kills, and reliable hold without losing a man. **13 - 11** It's an eco for XTS, they storm the B site and somehow get the frags and the bomb plant. 1v2 here as abe pushes through construction. He takes out XP3 but storm trades him out from dark spot, and XTS wins yet another eco. This game could go down to the wire! **14 - 11** lightworker gets a kill after the smokes go down at B site, but TM gets a double. He moves to CT to try to get aggressive but gets dropped by abe. Xp3 and desi move into A site, plant the bomb and drop everyone but mark. Mark moves to B to save, but gets taken out by Xp3 at banana. Exertus picking up a lot of momentum here, and Reliable will have to eco in round 26. **15 - 11** An awesome double boost-esque thing at potplant (Tstairs) allows some damage to go down at banana, and eventually the AK gets the frag. Everyone in the team contributes to some quick kills, and mark is left alone in a 5v1 situation. He remains at B site to save his gun and takes out XP3. He moves to construction to attempt to take out desi, but a nice headshot from desi shuts him down, and it's 4 game points for reliable. **15 - 12** It's an force buy round for reliable, making things tough for the CT side here. Great economic pressure from XTS. Mark gets a sensational 1 deag but warden trades him out. Lightworked in the mean time gets a double with the 5-7, but gets dropped at the B site. Comes down to a 3v1. Xp3 attempts to shut down the CTs, but gets flanked from all directions, and dies with 2 CTs remaining on the B site. Good eco win from reliable, keeping them in the game. **15 - 13** Abe gets boosted and gets one frag and some extra damage at the top of mid. Mark gets a kill at B site and it's a 3v5 here for XTS. Abe and robby get a kill each and it's up to storm to cause some trouble here. He saves his weapon and it's 15-13 here. XTS will need to save in order to buy on the 30th round. **16 - 13** Don't worry, XTS buy after all. Robby gets a quick kill but desi nabs two, giving the T side an advantage. Lightworker drops him but quickly finds himself in a 1v3 situation, and the game is wrapped up for Exertus. Good force buy from them, and after planting the A site, they drop lightworker in the apartments to win the game. **FULL-TIME -- Exertus beats Reliable 16-13** Exertus maintains their unbeaten run in CEVO, but it wasn't without nervous moments. Reliable show everyone why they need to be considered a threat despite their winless record in CEVO, with some great plays. Unfortunately, some silly pushes cost them some CT rounds and stop them from being able to force Overtime or a round win. In the end, Exertus maintained their composure under pressure to win the game, but that one really came down to the wire. **Thanks for reading, let me know if there's a game you want me to do in the near future and I'll see what I can do.

1410132297,2014-09-07,"I don't have much time, but **I will explain my reasoning on why I'm placing a medium sized bet on NetCodeGuides.** The home team for this match is NCG, this is known because [ESEA rules](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=content&amp;d=league_rules_csgo) state that the team on the left side of the [match page](http://play.esea.net/index.php?s=stats&amp;d=match&amp;id=3787597) is the home team. ------------------------------------------------------------------- **Current Odds on CSGL:** 59-41 **Personal Odds:** 65-35 **Bet Risk:** High ------------------------------------------------------------------- **NetCodeGuides:** NCG has a great player named Tarik. Tarik always performs solidly (even when he's drunk, some of you will get this reference) and is the team's lurker. On a less popular map in the CS:GO competitive scene like Season, where the teams don't have a full and complete knowledge of hiding places/corners/etc (unlike how they would have a complete knowledge on de_dust2), a good lurker with great aim such as Tarik can be quite beneficial. Just take a look at the map as a whole. There are multiple entrances into each bombsite -- nearly four per site -- and when teams are pressed for time, they will rush through these pathways, where a player like Tarik will be undoubtedly waiting. Additionally, jdm64 is one of the better AWPers in the NA scene. **I feel that a combination of jdm's picks at mid, along with Tarik's great lurking being given an advantage by the map being played in this BO1, as well as NCG being able to start CT side (Season is 54.64% CT sided) by being the home team, will result in NetcodeGuides taking this match.** ------------------------------------------------------------------ **eLevate:** According to [HLTV's](http://www.hltv.org/match/2292594-netcodeguidescom-exertus-esea-invite-season-17-north-america) statistics, each player on their team has been either underperforming in terms of player form, or simply on par with their usual performance, which will not be enough to beat an arguably stronger team than them -- like NCG. An exception to this is Xp3, who has performed slightly better than usual in his last two matches. As for desi (who is considered eLevate's best player) he underperformed in his last match. He is also more of a CT player, and my reasoning for this is that instead of the AK-47 being his best weapon like most pros (due to the 1-shot headshot capability it has), his is the M4A1-S. ----------------------------------------------------------------- **Disclaimer:** The above analysis is a product of my own research and opinions. As is the case in gambling, the results may not reflect the information and statistics available. There is no such thing as a safe bet, and you should evaluate whether it is necessary to take the risk of betting on a particular match by looking at your inventory's value, as well as the odds of the match on CSGL.",0.037,0.794,0.169,0.9971,11

1412584638,2014-10-06,"If people are wanting you to overpay, it's because you have items that are not desirable, no offense. Of course no one will trade you a $100 knife for $100 in random skins, if one of those ""random"" skins was desirable like a FT Awp Asiimov or M4A1-s Knight + small stuff then it makes more sense. The way that ive found to make money WITHOUT fail trading is to, this is going to sound stupid but, offer someone Item A for items B+C+D, then trade item B+C back to someone else for item A, keeping item D as your profit. **Here is an example of the above:** (These prices are probably close to real prices but I am just going off the top of my head or estimating) *-Lets say you have a M4A1-s Knight, its average selling price for the past week is $95 and is at $108 on the market currently. One way to make profit would be to trade it for an item worth less, but STILL DESIRABLE and easy to move, lets say a FT Awp Asiimov with good looks, Lets say the AWP is worth $70 on market and average selling price.* *-You have a difference of 25 dollars on average selling price and 38 on market. Make profit by valuing your item at the price on the market which is higher than its real value. You could ask for that awp, a 25 dollar skin, and a 10 dollar skin, both desirable by others. Their side of the trade would total $105. After making that trade, you could trade the Awp plus the $25 skin for the M4A1 Knight back from someone else, KEEPING the $10 skin as profit to use later. Sounds complicated but it isn't, and it definitely works.* Another good way is to realize the difference between an items ACTUAL price from the price of it on the market. Trade items that are inflated on the market, for items that have a real value of close to the inflated price of your item on the market. That example is easy to explain with keys, offer EVERYONE on CSGO lounge 38 keys for their M4A1-s Knight FN, once someone bites, resell it for 42 keys. Rinse and repeat. Sorry for the long explanation, but likely, the reason you can't find someone to overpay you is because you don't have items that are desirable to TRADERS. Also, trading isn't a get rich quick scheme, you will have to put a ton of time into it. The more you have, the easier it is to make profit.

Fnatic heading into M site with the bomb. 3vs3.... 2vs3 1vs3.... 1vs1...0vs1. Auto vs Cz? Pocket AK everytime. **13-15** Fnatic have Duped VP yet again. Pasza wants to save the Auto sniper. He saves the Auto. **13-16** JW gets a nice shot to start the round. quickly turns to a 3vs3. Olof lurks and takes out Snax. Pasza evens it out. Fnatic are focusing on B site. 2vs1. JW in upper. JW takes out 1 then gets taken out But no kit on the remaining VP member. ____________________________________________________________",0.059,0.778,0.163,0.9991,6

Map 2 **Inferno** **Lunatik (CT)** - **Rhythm (T)** **0-1** Rhythm takes the pistol** **0-2** Rhythm buys 4 P90s. Lunatik force buy and almost win the round, but dumore couldn't quite clutch the 1v2 **0-3** Rhythm wins as expected, losing 2 players. **1-3** WOW a great hold at B by Valens, takes down 3 with an m4a1 spray. **1-4** Rhythm are forced to save but take the round anyways. Not sure what went wrong there for Lunatik. **2-4** Why even buy? Lunatik take their turn to win an eco round with a fantastic cross fire setup. **2-5** Rhythm is able to force up almost a full buy and get some good entry frags and eventually take the round **2-6** LunatiK force buys and can't hold banana. Dumore is left on a 1v3, he takes down 1 and the remaining 2 have sub-20 hp but he can't clutch the round. Lunatik has to save. **3-6** WOW Dumore with a triple headshot save round kill. Absolutely massive play, and they win their eco round. **4-6** Lunatik are able to hold A and only lose 1 player. Assailant saves his awp. **4-7** Rhythm save but Assailant pushes through both a smoke AND a molitov to grab 2 kills with the awp he saved from last round. **5-7** Lunatik force buy again and RELYKS TAKES DOWN 3 IN THE SMOKE AT BANANA. Lunatik have really shown they're able to hold down B site with one of their players always coming up big. **6-7** Slemmy starts off the round with an awp pick at mid. Lunatik losses 2 players, and the 5 man tec-9 save from Rhythm doesn't work out. **6-8** Lots of pick from both sides, Rhythm is finally able to take B with only 1 person positioned on it from Lunatik. Lunatik won't have enough money to full buy on the last round of this half. **6-9** Rhythm takes A and plants the bomb. It's Assailant with a DOUBLE HEADSHOT 1v2 CLUTCH SPRAYDOWN. Assailant has been keeping his team in the game since the first map. **Rhythm (CT) - Lunatik (T)** **10-6** Rhythm takes the pistol round, only losing 1 player. **11-6** A forcebuy from Lunatik gets shutdown by a mag-7 and a P90. **12-6** A full save from Lunatik is slightly more successful than their forcebuy, taking down 3 players of Rhythm. Still no bombplant. **13-6** Not much to say about this round. Lunatik finally gets to buy but can't get a bombplant or a successful take on either site. **14-6** Eco round. Looking at a third map unless Lunatik can step up their T side on this next gun round. **15-6** F0bless from Rhythm with a nice flank taking down 2, and ryx holding down A site without even losing a point of health. Lunatik has enough money to buy AKs this next round. **15-7** Lunatik gets 2 great entry frags into B site and plants the bomb. The remaining 3 of Rhythm decide to save, with 1 player getting picked off. **Rhythm takes Inferno 16-7** Both teams taking their map choice, the third map will be nuke and sides will be decided by a knife round (I think?) Sorry if my notes are bias t'wards LunatiK, I have a fairly large bet placed on them. **Map 3 - Nuke** I've heard Rhythm barely plays this map as a team, but I don't think LunatiK is the strongest at this map either. Should be a very close deciding map! **Rhythm wins the knife round and will be starting CT side** **Rhythm (CT) - LunatiK (T)** **1-0** Syn from Rhythm gets aggressive early and gets picked off. Lunatik plants the bomb and slemmy almost comes up big but they lose the pistol. **2-0** Successful anti-eco round from Rhythm. **3-0** Lunatik are able to buy on this third round and successfully take ramp, but they're down a player by the time they start pushing B. They don't quite get the bomb plant and only take down 2 enemies. **4-0** Lunatik eco and get shut down outside. **4-1** Lunatik buy up and pick a Rhythm player who gets a little too aggressive. They take A and rotate B, winning the round and surviving with 2 guns. **5-1** Lunatik doesn't have an AWP to challenge assailant and lose a player early on outside. They play a slow game but it doesn't work out; they only manage to take down 1 enemy. **6-1** Eco round, the predictable happens. **7-1** LunatiK buy up, and get picked off by Assailant's awp 1 by 1 outside. 4k for Assailant, Lunatik hasn't bought an AWP this entire series. **8-1** Save round again, LunatiK saves an AK and gets a bomb plant. **9-1** LunatiK takes secret and its a 3v3. The bomb gets planted. Dumore in a 1v2 gets a nice 1 tap but again, the clutch doesn't happen. **9-2** Lunatik gets a pick right away in hut and push onto upper. 2 entry frags and plant the bomb. It's a 2v1 for lunatik and they finally take their second round. **10-2** LUNATIK STOP PEAKING THE AWP OUTSIDE! 1 gets picked instantly. They take lower and plant the bomb but they can't hold the site. **10-3** They push onto upper and then my stream froze. Turns into a 1v1 and fLOKi kills that remaining CT through the vent wall. ""VACation"" - Twitch chat **11-3** It's a force buy with a glass cannon awp for rhythm. They only lose 1 player and I'm not quite sure what lunatik was going for. **11-4** Tec-9 OP. fLOKi gets 3 kills with a Tec-9, its a 2v2. He picks up an M4A1-s and gets 2 more! Great shots from fLOKi. An ace on the final round of the half. **LunatiK (CT) - Rhythm (T)** **4-12** A nice nade takes 2 of Rhythm down to 50%. They take B and plant the bomb, getting a kill as well. A clean round for Rhythm, losing no players. **4-13** LunatiK full USP save. **5-13** 5 famas' for LunatiK. Win or lose the map on this round likely. Smokes everywhere and LunatiK sprays down Rhythm. 2 survive for LunatiK. **6-13** 4 Famas for Lunatik, rhythm with a full buy. Lunatik gets a pick outside. Rhythm takes control of outside and losses the remaining 4 players to a spray while trying to push through hut. **7-13** Save for Rhythm. Relyks gets stuck on a wall and gives up his rifle on ramp without getting any kills. Dumore gets 3 kills to make up for it. The remaining player of Rhythm picks up a rifle, gets a kill and saves it. Only 2 surviving from lunatik. **8-13** Almost full buy from Rhythm with a glass cannon AWP. WOW relyks with a 1 tap through a box headshot onto the glass cannon awp near B to open the round. fLOKi and Valens hold A and a completely flawless round for LunatiK, not even a single point of damage taken. The dream is alive! **9-13** Rhythm ecos and makes its a 4v2. They plant the bomb but Relyks makes a big play along with Slemmy and makes it a 1v2 in favor of LunatiK. I was scared for a second, but they got the plant and a great eco from Rhythm none the less. **10-13** Full buy for Rhythm. LunatiK playing this CT side well, only losing 1 to the AWP. Rhythm saves an AWP and an AK. **11-13** Rhythm full buy. WOW fLOKi Wallbangs Assailant through the wall on silo and just like that the awp is down. Another wall bang kill somewhere on the map makes it a 4v2 for LunatiK. They close out the round with 3 players surviving. **11-14** Rhythm push onto A and kill 3 instantly. They plant the bomb and kill the remaining 2, only losing 1 player. **12-14** Full buy for both teams but no AWP this round for Rhythm. They push on to A trading 1 for 1 over and over until Valens comes up huge with a double kill to close out the round. I think that round only lasted 30 seconds. **13-14** Save for Rhythm. **14-14** Full buy for both teams again, with an AWP in the hands of Assailant. They push A once again BUT OMG RELYKS THAT SPRAY TRANSFER YOUR A GOD AND SAVES THE ROUND. Turns it into a 1v1 and Slemmy wins it. If you haven't seen it, [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sncBUllgU8U) is why Relyks is a god. **15-14** Rhythm have to save. Oh my lord this was a close round that had me on the edge of my seat but LunatiK wins with 2 players barely alive. Rhythm are fighting for overtime. **15-15** Rhythm have a full buy, but no awp. LunatiK finally have an AWP. WTF IS THE CAMERA DOING its looking at the ground at the most important round of the game. It's a 1v2, Slemmy with an AWP gets 1 tapped by F0bless AND WERE GOING TO OVERTIME! **Overtime 1** **LunatiK (CT) - Rhythm (T)** **16-15** 3 grenades take slemmy down outside. Valens gets killed, looking the wrong way of the smoke. It's up to Relyks to hold down B by himself AND HE DOES. He gets 2 kills and holds it down B long enough for his team to show up. This has been and incredibly close and intense game so far. **17-15** Dumore playing above hut gets 2 kills and his team cleans up. Rhythm don't have enough money to full buy and they have limited nades and 1 player has a tec-9. **18-15** LunatiK holds all areas perfectly and only lose 1 player. It's up to Rhythm to 3-0 their CT side now. **Overtime 1, 2nd half** **Rhythm (CT) - LunatiK (T)** **16-18** Fo0bless kills 2 at hut BUT ASSAILANT MISSES possibly the most important shot of the map... A complete wiff on an easy shot and goes down. Its a 1v1, F0bless needs to ace vs Relyks to keep his team in the game. Relyks is at 20% health and f0bless takes him down with a nice flick shot. **17-18** Smokes keep LunatiK at bay and there's only 30 seconds left in the round and no kills have happened. They make a push upper and f0bless takes down 2. It's fLOKi in a 1v3 and he just saves an AK. **18-18** LunatiK are still able to full buy (no awp of course, it seems LunatiK doesn't like to awp. Ever). They push ramp and make it a 3v3. 3v2 for Rhythm. Ryleks gets a kill but he leaves his back open and dies. It's a 1v2 and the remaining T tries to plant the bomb but gets taken down by a grenade. Overtime 2. **Overtime 2** **Rhythm (CT) - Lunatik (T)** **18-19** It's a 2v2 after my screen got unplugged. It turns into a 1v2 for Slemmy, the very hard bottom fragger for LunatiK. He takes the first down, AND TAKES THE SECOND. Right when he needs to step it up the most, he does.

The CT side is more critical now because of the extra money it costs to get the M4A1s and the fact that if you lose the pistol round, you can't just buy CZ's to take it back. That means that if VP were to win the pistol round in any game as Terrorists, then they would essentially be up 4-0 before the first CT gun round. I think the patch actually makes already strong CT teams that much more potent, so I've been waiting to see how much so in a strong matchup.

1422226119,2015-01-25,"I feel so bad for NiP. But that third map was pretty fucking shit to watch... Cobblestone is ugly as fuck. I wanted to see cache or mirage. I skipped this one so I wouldnt be mad if one team was losing or some shit, but the first 2 maps were nice to watch. **BUT** *congrats to LDLC* Nice game guys. **Mikalalellelelelelelelelellelele** did really well. I thought his awping style was great, the shots he missed and hit were both great in their own way. Especially that quad kill he got on inferno, really saved his team there. (even though friberg couldnt clutch, it was nice to watch) Other shots were made off instinct or map knowledge, like some through the smoke. Definitly a good add for NiP. Some of the shots were insane, he made some entry frags, and like the casters said ""Did a great job doing what most awpers cannot do"" (something like that, hopefully you know what I mean) **Get_Right** started to do a bit bad, but brought back, he and friberg were doing great on inferno. Won and lost many clutches along with friberg. (one important clutch was a 1v3 he made.) Also he was a great lurker throughout the game, definitly opening up many places for NiP. **FriBerg**, lost and won some clutches. Hit a shitton of headshots and single-handly (i dont mean he carried, I mean in certain situations, he was definitly the guy to fall back on) helped his team. **Xizt**, not much to say but that he hit a shitton of great shots. He saved his team from the depths of hell a couple of times. EDIT: there is a bit more to say. He had his spray down perfectly this game. I'm positive I saw at least 3 sprays which gave him 4 insta kills. One was on cobble where he got LDLC to walk right into his shots (literally) **F0Rest**, great awper, on cobble he slacked a bit. But on other maps he hit the entry frags he needed and defended well. Also a great lurker throughout the game, Im not sure if he did it too much, but i saw him get a nice backstab (**not** literally) onto an LDLC player. **NBK** and his dualies, nuff said (well not really since i wrote more after this ;_;). Got some laughs from him, thinking he was insane, but then saw him hit those shots. Definitly gonna make me mad in solo-q, gonna see some DMGs using dualies and thinking they're as good as NBK (fuk u nbk, i h8 u) On the serious side: On inferno B he hit so many headshots with that M4a1-s. He also did well in ecos and had plently of good concise frags. **Smittz**, great awper. Hit many nice shots. His team basically laid back on him. On inferno he had arches down pretty well in a couple of rounds. On D2, he was a great awper for that double awp setup we now see. Definitly hit many of his shots, which helped give LDLC the advantage. **Shoxxie**, again, great awp shots. Definitly had some entry frags and some nice defending. On D2 he could hold long and cat at the same time. At ramp he also could defend A site perfectly. I saw plenty of great mid awp shots from him aswell. On Inferno, I personally felt like he didnt use his awp to perfection, but then saw some great frags from him. **Kioshima**, Holy fuck, this guy definitly deserves an MVP along w/ Happy. He did pretty damn well on D2 (ESPECIALLY D2) and the other 2 maps. Hit many nice ass shots. EXCELLENT rifler, calm in all situations. At certain times he would just randomly get 2 kills and definitly secure the round for LDLC. **Happy** and his triple combo, using an awp, IGL, and also being a rifler. Many times throughout the game I was suprised to see him use an AWP. Then instantly I ate my words and see him getting 3 frags or so. He also used the rifle at upmost perfection. Whether it was hitting shots through the smoke with his master game sense or just getting 3 insta headshots and clutching it for his team.",0.099,0.641,0.26,0.9994,12

They've been playing great lately, but I think that's because all 5 of the players have been pretty on point. Swapping out one of them might cause the whole team to crash. EnVy looked a bit shaky a few weeks ago, but they've redeemed themselves in the last few games and are, and should be, the clear favorites for this tournament, since NiP and Fnatic won't be attending the tournament. I don't think VP will be able to beat EnVy. I think EnVy is a way too focused team and won't be dropping many rounds in a row because of sloppy play. VP has their moments, but they're rather inconsistent. Lately they've been playing well, with Pasha being on point and Taz stepping it up, but I think EnVy will beat them strat-wise. EnVy has a lot of unique and, well, cool strats, which I think will be enough to beat VP. I'm a low ball, but I'll be putting like 1€ (M4A1-S | Blood Tiger) on EnVy.

1432541545,2015-05-25,"My first analysis so please be kind! Any suggestions will be greatly welcomed **Analysis** **GPlay** GPlay recently won vs Piter and Penta in a BO1. They lost to ex-CHW in a BO1 as well as losing against Rock and Mouz 2-0. From the stats alone, Gplay are doing pretty well against T2-T3 teams but they are very inconsistent. Gplay will need V1c7or to go hot for them to win the series. **Dignitas** Dignitas hasn't been having great results lately but it is understandable as they mostly lost to T1 teams such as Na`Vi, EnvyUs and TSM. However, they took VP to a 1-1 tie as well. Dignitas seems to be doing great against T2 teams, if we exclude their recent loss to Espilon. They've beaten HellRaisers in 3 maps, PENTA, LDLC Blue, FlipSide twice and even Mousesports. For Dignitas, as long as either one of Aizy, Kjaerbye, Nico and Pimp shows up, they should win this BO3 convincingly. **Personal Bets** I started a betting series where I bet only my ST AK Blue Laminate FN and my M4A1-S Cyrex once it's tradable. For this game, I will bet my $16 ST AK Blue Laminate FN on Dignitas. http://i.imgur.com/s4HXe6l.png Follow my spreadsheet to track my progress or to say RIP skins https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_brAoNUlWiJtgx3tTFQeIx5uItOOHdoO2yZqH4RhOVE/edit?usp=sharing",0.107,0.752,0.141,0.8118,1

1432616696,2015-05-26,"**Analysis** **FlipSid3 Tactics** If you look on the FlipSid3's performance alone in May, you might think that they're playing really badly. But the reason is because, they've been playing against T1 and higher T2 teams such as VP, NiP, Fnatic, HR, Mouz, TSM and Dignitas. FlipSid3 is a high T2 team at best so it's understandable that they lost against these teams. Not to mention that Simple hasn't been playing recently too. But their lost to Neophyte early in the month is unacceptable since you consider them a high T2 team. They were also brought to a 2-1 score against LDLC White. The potential is there for FlipSid3 as they've proven in April that they can beat T1 teams but following their recent performances, they've looked really really shaky. **PiTER** PiTER has been playing fairly great before their loss to Vega and Titan recently. They've won against mostly lower T2-T3 teams so it doesn't really apply to this match. The last time PiTER played against FlipSid3, it ended badly, but that was almost 3 months ago. **Personal Bets** Skipping. Why? FlipSid3 hasn't been doing too great and we don't know for sure which F3 side will show up. Will it be the one that beat VP or the one that lost to Neophyte? PiTER hasn't played against teams equal to or stronger than F3 that much and when they do, they usually lose. If you really want to bet on this game, I suggest a **LOW** on F3. The odds isn't too great right now. It's a 60/40 FS, in my opinion, based on recent performances. EDIT: Apparently, Simple won't be playing again. I'll still stick to my analysis. **Notes** I started a betting series where I bet only my ST AK Blue Laminate FN and my M4A1-S Cyrex once it's tradable.

They lost to PiTER (14-16 BO1)and Kinguin (2-0 BO3). Prior to that, they beat KillerFish (2-0) BO3, and taking Na`Vi and Property to a 1-1 score. **PENTA** PENTA is not performing well at this moment.

Losing denis, spiidi and nex has made PENTA a much weaker team than they were before. **Personal Bets** Skipping. This game is a 55-45 odds at best and it's currently favoring CHW at 62%. If you have the inventory to spare, a **LOW** on PENTA would be advisable. **Notes** I started a betting series where I bet only my ST AK Blue Laminate FN and my M4A1-S Cyrex once it's tradable.

Seriously this is fcking bull, its not really their fault on how they had money!~ THIS HAPPENED BEFORE! CLG vs a team where Hazed got DDOGED and lucky came in for them. When hazed was DC'd he had about 3200 money and lucky had 800. When hazed was about to reconnect after a few rounds, Lucky dropped 1 AWP 1 M4a1-s and some pistols then disconnected. Then Hazed came in with a heaping 10,600. Why was this not questioned??? Why didn't the admins ban or DQ'd CLG? Why??? because they're favorites. they're famous, thats all. No one really cared about it, the commentators even stated it that Lucky dropped everything for them. It's just that Mortality isn't famous enough by the community, this is a sad thing to happen too. A lot of mortality personnel or players are mostly young talented people (Like swag). They were banned because of hackusations and there was no proof not even Valve banned them on any events because of these accusations.

1440451272,2015-08-24,"I do :) Trading up to skins has a negative Expected Value (EV) in the long run. If you calculate the total value of the skins you are trading up versus the value of the 1 skin you will receive in return, then you will (on average) get a negative % ROI (return on investment). There are ways to profit from the trade up contract, but it would only be done by taking a huge risk. At the lower ends of the spectrum (i.e. light blues, blues, and purples) the amount of skins you can receive varies greatly, which will also affect the ROI of your trade up. In case you weren't aware, trade up's have a formula that can be somewhat defined. Each skin you put in from a certain collection gives you a chance to receive the higher skin from that particular collection. So if you've got 10 blues from the 'Gods and Monsters' collection, then you are 100% guaranteed to get a pink from that same collection. And that pink can either be a M4A1-S Icarus Fell ($150ish) or a G3SG1 Chronos ($13ish). If you were to buy all the blues off the market individually, you would look for the best value for your money. In this case, both the UMP Minotaur's Labyrinth and MP9 Pandora's Box are around $10 each, which would put you at around $100 for 10 of them. At that point, you have a 50/50 chance to profit $50 or lose $85. So as you can see, the EV would be -$35 if you did that to infinity. Here is a link where you can see all the guns from the 'Gods and Monsters' collection. It is what I used for reference in this example, however you can check out other collections to compare what you'd get. You will always find that there is a risk involved where you can either get 1 superior skin or 1 inferior skin. http://csgostash.com/collection/The+Gods+and+Monsters+Collection Furthermore, the quality of the items in your trade up have been proven to affect the quality of the skin you receive. So putting 10 factory new skins in a trade up contract effectively guarantees the skin you get will be either Minimal Wear or Factory New. HOWEVER (and this is a HUGE HOWEVER), certain skins DO NOT drop in equal percentages across the gun quality spectrum. A weapon like the AK-47 Fire Serpent has a VERY LOW percentage of Factory New quality and therefore it DOES NOT fall into this specific example. Another example of this would be the Factory New AK-47 Black Laminiate. Here is a link detailing the intricacies of exterior quality in trade-ups: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=420402033 TL;DR - The market has already figured this out. If there was any profit to be made by trading up, savvy investors have done it and inflated the prices of skins so that there is ALWAYS a huge risk in doing a trade up.",0.07,0.817,0.114,0.9688,8
1440486825,2015-08-25,"&gt;That is a bit contradictory due to the fact that risk is one of the factors that is being taken into consideration when calculating ev. So depending on the success-percentage (risk) the ev is + or -. That is a fair point. I guess my TL;DR kind of addresses what my point was with that statement. If there ever was a profit to be made, it has already been done. In the future there could be additional avenues, but it would depend on a steam side update (like when they introduced the ability to trade up stat track weapons) rather than a new operation or skin pack. &gt;Question: Do you have any links to back up these statistics? Are there any sites that publish such? The links to back up the statistics are out there, but I haven't looked for them in a while. I know that when I was looking, my main source of information came from steam group postings and the /r/globaloffensive subreddit. That and google of course. As for the second question.... I think it's fair to say that maybe no site exists to track the specifics of trade up contracts. There are trade-up simulators that mimic what CS does, but those are most certainly based on speculation. I would link them, but they are kind of shitty (i.e. semi-shady) if you ask me. If you truly must see them, a simple google search for 'cs go trade up simulator' will get you the exact stuff I've seen. Otherwise, the stuff I listed in my response is accurate to my knowledge. I may be off on a small detail here or there, but I am confident that I have a good grasp on how the dynamics of trade ups work. The main thing is understanding the collections you are pulling from. A lot of big time streamers (Phatoml0rd) do ""high risk"" trade ups where they buy 6 M4A1-s Knights and 4 Nova Antigues to have a 60% chance of getting a MW or FN Dragon Lore. The Knight is part of the 'Cobblestone Collection' which has the DLore in it as the red weapon. If you had 10 FN M4A1-s Knight's to trade-up, you would be 100% guaranteed to get a DLore, but you'd be spending $2200 to do so. Considering a FN DLore goes for around $1500, you'd be spending more to trade up to it than to outright buy it. Just dig around a bit and you'll find what you need. To my knowledge, a site doesn't exist that tracks the results of trade ups. And I believe the reason for that is because Valve are the only people who truly know the formula for how it works.",0.037,0.888,0.075,0.9556,2

1442453722,2015-09-17,"P.S: My Post is rather untidy, Sorry in advance :) NIP vs Fnatic BO1 Fnatic is the best team in the world right now, no doubt. Winning 4 games in a row beating TSM, G2.Kinguin, Mouz and Titan. They did not perform well during Dubai but after they came back they seemed to not be affected and quickly started to go back to their old form. The dominating, team crushing Fnatic. NIP, is starting to make a comeback after a strong performance in Dubai, only to be stopped by TSM and it was a fairly close game, ending 2:1. After Dubai, they retained their form and dominated envy on train winning 12 rounds on t side. Shortly after they played against SK and won with a score of 16:9. Notes: Fnatic will be using a standin G2.Dennis for krimz. This might affect their communications and co-operation. As krimz and olof are very good friends. But in terms of fragging dennis can match up to krimz as dennis is quite an aim monster as seen in G2.Kinguin, rarely bottom fragging. The map chosen is cache which both teams do fairly well on but this map is more of an aim map and less strat-reliant so Fnatic can not abuse NiP's old strats. And if Get_Right manage to lurk his way through without getting taken down by anyone, I can see Fnatic losing this game just because of Get_Right's impact in shutting down the executes. And since the m4a1-s got nerfed many players are using the m4a4 and this benefits NiP as Friberg and sometimes Xizt would switch to the m4a4 and this would help them since they know the spray pattern better and the overall weapon better. Odds are 24%-76% for Fnatic on lounge. I would suggest 3-5% of your inventory on NiP as i believe this is more of a 45%-55% to Fnatic game.",0.083,0.762,0.155,0.986,1

1443487066,2015-09-29,"*Repost of my analysis of Follow eSports vs. Games Academy | BO1 | 24.09.15 | 03:00 CEST* After suffering a severely disappointing loss against CLG in the semifinal of the FACEIT League 2015 Stage 3 NA Closed Qualifiers on the 20th, Fe substituted desi for APE and have played four matches with desi since. On the 22nd in the RGN Freedom Cup, they beat vVv Gaming 16-3 on Dust 2 but lost 4-16 against Method on Cache. A day later, they ended playing a very close contest against Method in CEVO Pro Season 8 with both maps going to overtime. Fe were able to prevail in the first map 19-15 on Dust 2 but lost Mirage 20-22 despite starting off T side and putting up 8 rounds in the first half. OCEAN made a [highly questionable play](https://youtu.be/O_LLBECR4Do?t=47m18s) on Mirage late in the game on Round 28 with his team up 15-12 where he was in a great position boosted on an ammo crate in the corner of the B site platform but he ended up throwing a smoke that revealed his location and cost his team their best chance in regulation as he was the only defense there. Follow eSports also lost to Team Coast on Inferno in ESEA 3-16. Games Academy's most recent form was winning the CYBERPOWERPC $5K LAN this past weekend by defeating 3sUP (who used mOE as a stand-in) in the final. Henrique ""hen1"" Teles was the key to Games Academy's victory at the LAN as he was very consistent whenever he had the AWP in his hands. They also defeated vVv Gaming 16-11 on Mirage in the RGN Freedom Cup yesterday where they put up a strong 11-4 T side to start off the match. Going back to Fe, the key with their team is desi. It's clear that desi is an absolute fragging machine. However, he receives a lot of flack for not being that cerebral mind who understands positioning and situational awareness. But, when he's on, he can destroy the confidence in his opposition and tear them apart. My other question with Fe is the fact they have two IGLs on their team in OCEAN and hades. I'm not sure how those two will mesh together going forward. Both aren't known for being exceptional fraggers so having both of them on the same team begs the question, who will step up with rifle? Also, why not keep APE on the team as the trade-fragger/second man in or keep him as the lurk while moving OCEAN or hades to a coaching role? There are many questions with both of these teams with one new to the scene and the other's constant roster shifting. This is quite the risky match but I'd still have to give Follow eSports the slight advantage here due to their experience in NA professional leagues. Taking into account how both GAcademy and Fe played against vVv Gaming recently on Mirage and Dust 2 respectively and how well Fe played against Method yesterday, I'd say this is a 55%-45% in favor of Fe because this is a BO1 and anything can happen. I believe the odds are skewed right now as of 24.09.15 | 01:00 CEST in GAcademy's favor -- currently 69% for them -- because of how Fe lost 4-16 against Method on Cache. Considering once again that this is a BO1, there is no way GA should be this close to 70%. The odds ended at 66%-34% in favor of GAcademy but they lost the match. -------------------------- **Analysis for Today's Game** -------------------------- The first thing to note here is that I was watching FalleN's stream and several subscribers on his channel stated that GAcademy are playing in a gaming house across the street from them. GAcademy apparently will be staying in the US for three months hoping to make a name for themselves in the NA. This makes sense considering FalleN was visible via Games' Academy's webcam on their Azubu stream watching behind them when they were playing Follow eSports on the 24th. Please note that GAcademy and LG have been scrimming against each other since Games Academy moved to that gaming house (I have not been able to confirm the exact date since that happened but I believe it was close to before they competed in the CYBERPOWERPC $5K LAN two weeks ago) and should be expected to be more crisp as a result. GAcademy recently came off of a close win defeating Method on Cache yesterday in the RGN Freedom Cup winning 16-13. Meanwhile since my last analysis, Follow eSports have tied NME 1-1 in a BO2 winning the first map 16-12 after allowing 8 T side rounds to NME in the first half before mounting a strong T side of their own; they then lost the second map 14-16 because they gave NME 10 T side rounds to start the first half of Inferno. They put up a valiant effort to bring it back but NME was able to close it out on the very last round of regulation. NME has been playing well recently going 1-1 against LG in a BO2 in CEVO while defeating compLexity on Train in the RGN Freedom Cup. The were stomped in between those matches by Conquest in a BO2 by losing the second map 2-16 on Inferno, but they were competitive in the first map losing 14-16 on Cache. The thing to note since the M4A1-S nerf is that maps have seemingly become even more T-sided because of the AK-47's sheer dominance over both colt weapons. Right now, I'd have to say this is as 50%-50% a match as can be as shown during their last meeting when both teams went into overtime on Mirage with Fe prevailing 19-15.",0.091,0.793,0.116,0.9831,2

1443574139,2015-09-30,"These two teams last played one another on September 18th in this same league where 3sUP dominated on Inferno winning 16-7. The telling tale here was compLexity's relatively poor T-side to start the match where they only managed 4 rounds. In the old meta, prior to the the nerf of the M4A1-S, 4 rounds would have been plenty. However, the AK47 is now the king of rifles after the nerf and many maps have appeared to be more T-sided as a result. What was surprising was that despite losing the knife round and being relegated to start T-side, compLexity did win the pistol round but were immediately anti-ecoed right afterwards. The second half seemed promising for compLexity when they won the pistol round and the following two anti-eco rounds to bring things to 7-11 but 3sUP won the first buy round and won out from there to close things out at 16-7. It's also worth nothing that 3sUP have been slumping since finishing 3rd at WINOUT LAN where they have played 9 matches and have only won one -- which was that match against compLexity on Inferno -- match in that span. Meanwhile for compLexity they've come off of a bad loss to NME on Train in the RGN Freedom Cup 5-16 where they couldn't pick up a single T-side round after putting up 5 CT rounds in the first half. Both of these teams are struggling right now so this match is very risky. I'd have to give compLexity the slight edge because autimatic, sancz, and roca could light up the score board on any given day so I'd put the odds in favor of them 55%-45% over 3sUP.",0.066,0.785,0.149,0.9791,1

They are the easiest to exchange, their price is constant, they are basically currency of csgo now. when it comes to skins ak redlines are good, as somebody advised earlier. Also, you can take the advantage of the market now and buy different m4a1-s. They are still really cheap, due to the patch and they will probably become more expensive. - you earn by betting and in item value. I have been using awp electric hive FT to bet. The price may not be that stable, but you can take advantage of that. I bought one couple weeks ago for 5,90 euro and sold it yesterday for 7,99 euro. They are also very easy to sell, you just have to wait for a good moment when price is high. Regarding your betting strategy I can say something from the first hand. I have just yesterday sold my inventory and cashed out, went from literally 0 to 50 euro. My strategy was to bet overdogs only (no ICB or low underdog bullshit). As I can see your inventory is not big, just as mine wasn't, so we cannot shake off the loses like huge bettors can. Buy couple of skins and place regular bets, I was usually betting 20 euro (I know it's a lot comparing to inventory size) but got good 3-5 euro return from each bet. Just be cautious as we are in a weird moment on the professional scene, some good teams are not on point (fnatic), some are completely random (NiP), some are consistent (TSM) but upsets happen all the time.

Anyways I've been playing CS:GO for nearly two years now and played 1.6 a long time a go, I have always been attracted to the pro scene in 1.6 old NiP/SK were my favorites. Fast forward a few years I am watching the CS:GO pro scene around 2013, watching the 2013 Ninjas was awesome I was able to witness there 87-0 win streak and I was really in awe after that, I started to play match making a lot. August 2013 comes a long and the Arms Deal Update is released, so many new weapon skins came out and I thought it was the coolest thing ever, I wanted skins but I didn't have much money at the time so it was out of the question for me. I kept playing mostly match making until 2014 when I got a part time job at a local Gas Station and was able to make enough money to buy some skins, I never knew at this time that CSGO skin betting had exploded and when I was introduced to lounge I really wanted to get involved in it. I purchased around 30 dollars in skins and actually did quite well in betting I got around to a 80 dollar inventory but then I did a max bet on a game that was a upset (i don't remember teams) I then had only about 15 dollars worth of skins left which I ended up selling so I could buy Portal 2. Coming earlier 2015 I began playing with a FACEIT team and competing in FACEITs daily tournaments and ladders I racked about quite a bit of points and was able to get a StatTrak M4A1-S Nitro MW which was worth around 40ish dollars at the time, I wanted to get back into betting again but without following the pro scene for such a long time new and up coming teams were upsetting and I was unaware of this. Fnatic had become a strong team easily number 1/2 LDLC was also easily number 1/2 NiP picked up Maiklele after Flifaren left. I lost my M4 again after making a bet on NiP vs Fnatic in BO3, I thought that NiP would be the better team but times have changed a lot from CSGO 2013 and 1.6. So I hope I can win this giveaway to have a inventory to restart and have an educated person like you help me understand this new era of counterstrike it isn't like 1.6 at all anymore and maybe I just need someone to guide me so I can eventually understand it on my own.

1448681217,2015-11-28,"1354 A few months ago I won an AWP¦Man o' War ($10) on an underdog. I can't remember all the details but I remember betting it on a 95/5 underdog, my reasoning was that they 95% team was playing a bo5 before hand so I thought they would be tired. The bo5 went on 3 hours after my match was supposed to start so it was cancelled and I probably was saved. realising how lucky I probably was I put it on an overdog which I can't remember but I think it was NIP vs Envy with Envy being the overdog. The match was going to be played while I was asleep and I was very special and greedy at the time (which I still kind of am) so right before I went to bed I somewhat reluctantly switched the bet to NIP, which I knew was a bad idea because NIP was doing absolutely shite at the time but I nearly lost it on another silly bet so it's basically a free bet (yep, I have all the logic!). I somehow woke up to an M4a1-S¦Hyper Beast MW ($30), it was when NIP miraculously started winning matches. I never risked the man o war on an underdog after that, but I only bet it about 4 times before I lost it. That's not my biggest loss though. I didn't bet my hyper beast because I was too scared to lose it, util they nerfed it... it went from $30 to $20 so I got angry with it and bet it on an overdog (something around 80%+) that I knew was going to win. The first time I bet with it and I lose it. Since then I've never bet anything more than about $4 and I don't bet as much, keeping all my nicer skins away from betting. Even if I know the outcome I don't bet high, I've learnt that if I bet high (high for me) then I will lose it no matter the matchup or how I bet.

1451486092,2015-12-30,"This is going to be a **long** story so I suggest getting some popcorn and soda. Hope you don't sleep. Well, mine's not too much. T'was a few months ago, I was a young lad gathering me skins from the scraps of the game drops. A mere PP-Bizon Sand Dashed made me excited as those young Japanese girls, waiting for the octopus. The first skin I got, the precious four cent skin was placed on a random bet, my first ever bet– ye olde Hellraisers with the sex god himself against Team Swageth Y0l0. I watched as the god himself did his magic, destroying his foes with that kraken. It was entertaining. The match ended with the god winning it yet I found out that I received no booty from ye returns. I talked to me mate and convinced him to give me a skin, a $3 M4A1-S Guardian. It was beautiful. I won a mere number of bets until I lost it on Fnatic when they lost to Titan. Me first ever bet loss. I was devastated. An item that could've boosted me inventory, disappeared like Amelia Earheart into the depths of lounge. I was able to work me way from the few winnings I got. I sold ye Chroma 2 cases when it was new and pitched out my own money to get.. A knife. It was beautiful. The quicksold $40 Gut Knife Urban Masked in field tested condition was my gateway out of poverty hell. Or so I thought. I placed it in a few bets, winning $3-$6 from my usual 40 cent wins. I became greedy. I kept placing everything I've got to different overdog, sure win bets until the one game. Mouz against 1337. I can never forgive and forget the day when Mouz betrayed me. With 90% odds for Mouz, it was obvious that they threw. The biggest item I had, along with my other items–gone, in that one single bet. I promised myself never to all-in again. A few months passed and I was able to bring my inventory to $40 until the same friend (now rich as hell) decided to lend me his asiimov to bet on different games, with me keeping 26% of the returns. It was glorious. I won multiple bets, winning left and right until he made me all in the hundred dollars on Fnatic against pre-slump NiP. Everything worked for has been gone, just like the time I lost the knife. However, I was able to earn some $10 which was good for my inventory. A few more months passed until the same said friend won an underdog bet, giving him $300. He gave me a glorious Falchion knife scorched and I traded it for a majestic gut knife night. Until I lost it to another foolish choice. I was stupid to believe that SK can beat NiP. I tried to play the odds, the 15% odds but they were not in my favor. I lost my third biggest bet. Afterwards, I decided not to be a parasite and bet my way up to a knife all on my own. I decided to join a betting group, Flamedyr's October group which was free. I earned around $10 and joined his paid November group. I was earning a lot from following his bets until mid-November, where everything went downhill. He predicted wrong games, losing left and right until we found out that he scammed everyone, saying that he had leukemia and all. It was devastating. Now, I follow different betting groups and up $80. I'm on the road to the Hundred Dollar Dream, when I plan to get a knife (a huntsman) and get to keep some play skins. I'm surprised that you made it up to this point without sleeping. TL;DR: Started with nothing, friend lent me skins, lost 3 huge bets due to stupid mistakes, got scammed by a predictor, up $80 now.

1451492970,2015-12-30,"Alright. So it was the the morning after many lost ICB's and 'low bets.' My inventory had roughly dropped from 10 dollars to 3 dollars after purely betting on underdogs. (I was very new to betting so I practically flipped a coin to see who to bet on). Anyways, I didn't know what to do, only 3 dollars and no games that seemed like profit, except for one. It was The Virtus Plow vs an unknown Spanish team called 'OverGaming'. The odds were ridiculous, something like 90 to 10 for a bo1. I decided to do what any other clueless better would do.. I went all in. I had done some brief research and found that Inferno was OG's best map while VP struggled. This, coupled with the golden rule gave me the courage to put all my faith in 'Flipin' and the rest of Spaniards. Sure enough, OG came through and won. I ended up winning an m4a1-s guardian which I loved for many weeks before everything came full circle and I lost it betting on VP a month later. Since then I've only gone downhill, never able to replicate any big bet successes and I've mostly moved on after I no longer knew I could remake the money I had lost.

You see, our beloved Jinja had never been that great at betting, and unfortunately, he never took the time to learn as well as he could have. He still was smart and would win many bets, but in the end of the day, he always ended just a little bit negative. Once he cased his M4A1-S Hyperbeast he finally knew he had a skin to use, to dominate the lounge, since this one was overvalued on Lounge by $15. His friends told him no, but once he had brought in the dough, he knew he had proved them wrong... that is... until today. He didn't know what would happen. Our beloved Jinja placed his bets as normal, following the advice of a very small analyst who had guided him into winning his fat stacks. This is when tragedy struck. It was the worst day of his career. There were so many matches and Jinja bet on all of them, losing way more than he won. So much more, that he went borderline bankrupt. He had ~$10 in winnings left... and his Hyperbeast. Jinja assessed the situation, ""I... i... i can't believe I lost so much, I... i... i just need to win a little to get started again."" And without a thought he placed a bet. With the rest of his skins on the line, he predicted CLG to beat Leader-1. When our beloved Jinja woke the next day, it was dark. He could feel that his knees were weak, palms were sweaty. He woke up with vomit on his sweater already, it was mom's spaghetti. He knew there was something wrong. As he looked on his phone, checking his returns, it was empty. He couldn't believe it, how could he [come so far, to lose it all](https://youtu.be/ZP-bAlOJzWc?t=42s)? His body froze.

I was so happy because I made some good profit, but I did not really play with M4A4 so I traded it to StatTrak M4A1-S Bright Water MW, which was a downgrade by looking at the price.

Many happy moments with it. My happiness ended when I lent my M9 knife to a friend IRL, who was going to a LAN. I made a huge mistake. A trusted him and he gambled it away the next day. He left me completely and never talked to me ever since. Almost the literal meaning of getting stabbed from the back. All I had was the M4A1-S which was special.

Let me explain: **(this is not a story for attention, just a fun little story about how a skin can mean so much to me)** It all started when i first played csgo, i was instantly in love with the game and the way skins work. I instantly got addicted to trading skins, and after a lot of trading i got enough money to buy a m4a1-s guardian. The skin is so cool, but also really simplistic. I kept the skin in my inventory and traded with another skin, just because i liked it so much. Long story short, the weapon became a part of me, and has fought in matches from silver master to LE. Even though i traded up to a €200 knife with the other skins i had, the guardian was still worth more to me. Sadly, i got scammed recently losing all my skins (own mistake, don't feel sad for me). My friend bought me a €10 skin to keep me happy, so that's the only thing i have right now. I can't sell it, because friendship is worth even more than that skin, but if i got enough money, i will most likely buy it again. Tl;dr, i made passionate love with an in-game item. Good luck everyone with the contest, i've read some good (and hopefully real) stories. +rep to OP, for doing this Also, i didn't buy any skins with real money, i traded it up from 0 to 200.",0.057,0.731,0.212,0.9924,4

At that point i knew how to use one guy: the UMP-45. So i bought what i thought was a super nice skin for it, a stat-trak labyrinth for about .10$. After that i got an M4a1-s boreal forest, and AWP safari mesh and an AK predator and called my inventory awesome for about 2 weeks.

It would be better to diversify the value of your items so that you can bet roughly the mentioned percentages. If you want to bet on Fanobet however, I´d advise you to buy an ""ugly"" knife as cheap as you can and deposit it, because when (and if) you win and want to withdraw, you will be getting back good quality items (such as low-mid tier knives, asiimovs, vulcans). Both of the websites have some advantages to them, but to briefly give my opinion **CSGOLounge** * Generally better odds * better for small bettors - you won´t generally get better odds than 5.0 on Fanobet, while rewards like 5:1 or more are possible (and quite common) * Generally Lounge is better if you want to bet 10-60 minutes before the match and go away as there is nothing you can do about it **Fanobet** * Fixed odds - once you make a bet the odds are set in stone, which allows you to get some great overdog bets if you see them early enough * Better item returns - on CSGL the limit is $75/item (even though some items are undervalued), while Fanobet allows you to get high tier knives * Live bets - if you actually have the time to watch the matches, it is worth considering to have at least some amount of money on Fanobet as you can bet on lounge and then make a live bet for a certain profit **tl;dr** If you want to bet on lounge, get skins of various sizes and check http://csgobackpack.net/lounge.php for the best deals If you want to bet on fanobet, get a cheap ugly knife",0.013,0.791,0.196,0.9954,1

StatTrak Galil | Eco (Well-Worn) is 115% overpriced (was $4 on Lounge a month ago, I bought these for $2.5), I used these before FAMASes. -------------- But I lost all these items eventually, because betting on overdog was giving underpay mostly, and I couldn't recover from losses.

With a few safer bets I recovered all losses from the whole betting history and about to pay out the knife I bought to my brother. I got $50 in items literally in 3-4 days. Betting on these on overdog finally gives something and takes unneeded risk away (inb4 you should bet on underdog cuz playing odds, but losing all skins on potential upsets isn't great if your inventory is small, so I prefer playing odds on overdogs). Of course I never betted both Coils on same match, going all-in is the worst idea and clench is so hard, and one Coil is enough to bring you skins. So if I'd were you, I'd get one Coil adding +$18, then carefully betted on guaranteed wins (with deep research and stuff, and only on established teams, not this T3 shit) until I'd pay it off. Betting $2 skins on &gt;65% overdog will bring you Sand Dunes that's for sure (you need something around $7 to not getting constantly underpaid) and you will build inventory for ages waiting for a good match, upsets are not that likely to happen (*cough* MGL qualifier *cough*).

Prize pool: AWP | Redline (MW), AWP | Fever Dream (FT), M4A1-S | Decimator (FT) respectively # NIP vs NRG - BO1 - Predicted Map: Overpass/Mirage - Predicted score: 16-14 # NIP ML @2.10 [1%] # Over 26.5 rounds @1.80 [3%] NIP showed quite a poor performance in Dallas, mostly due to pita standing in for Dennis. Now that they have Dennis back in their squad, NIP should look much better. Another issue is Lekro’s inconsistency. He could top frag in one match and he could look absolute shit on another. NRG on the other side also showed a poor performance in Dallas, as they’re also known as an inconsistent team. This is looking like a 50/50 match for me and it will depend on the day. One player stepping up could decide the game and I’m liking the NIP odds!",0.109,0.767,0.124,-0.2874,2
