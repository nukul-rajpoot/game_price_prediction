Well, I've never really been a fan of Counter Strike, played a little bit of 1.6 and it wasn't something that held my interest for a long time.I started playing CoD4 on Promod (ESL/CB), once the game lost a lot of players and audience I was missing some good FPS game.I started playing League of Legends since beta (4-5 years) with my IRL friends, they all used to play CS 1.6 and gifted me CS:GO like 2 months ago.I was like, ""I've never been good at CS, the game is too static for me."" and guess what, once I played it, I really liked it.It's the only competetive FPS right and it's starting to grow. Right now, after 2 months I'm sitting at Distinguished Master Guardian and trying to get that Eagle, the game's absolutely amazing and I'm happy my mates made me play it. :)",0.059,0.668,0.273,0.9897,2

1420182582,2015-01-02,"104 Okay, well on the day after Christmas I won a jaguar in a giveaway, my first covert, and traded it into an M4A1-S Atomic alloy, Redline AWP and USP-S Orion (all minimal wear) and my inventory has never looked this good before. Then the next day, I added $25 to my steam account, bought some games and thought ""fuck it, I'll do some unboxing"". I don't do much unboxing so this is pretty rare. I bought 5 keys, first 3 crates were blues, but in the fourth crate, I got a huntsman knife. My first knife ever. Out of 5 cases. In my cs:go career I've opened about 20 maybe 25 cases so this was HUGE. After hours of trading, I turned it into a Karambit Boreal Forest. But about 20 minutes after I got the Karambit, I was scammed. Long story short, I was a moron who downloaded third-party content and this guy got control of my account and stole everything I own, about $200 in items. I thought I could trust him because I used to know him IRL but looks like you can't trust anyone. I am waiting on a reply from steam support (sent a ticket on the 27th of December, I've been waiting a whole year for their reply!) and now I just need to wait and see what happens. **TL:DR** My inventory went from $8 value to $200 value in 2 days, and then I got scammed out of it all.

I'd been slowly building up to that Cyrex ever since I got into the CS:GO trading scene. Turns out, this scammer was actually a **really credible person**. Not only did he hold the real impression of a successful CS:GO trader/player but he actually was a successful person. Level 30 with about 30 games with many hours played on it. I thought I couldn't go wrong.

1424200165,2015-02-17,"""RUSH B!"", one of my team mate shouted on our eco round. Everyone gave the affirmative sign, except me. My team mates were fools, but I for sure wasn't. The round started and I peeked mid, hoping that my eyesight would not fail me... Four CTs had passed by mid to B, and I knew for sure that my team is doomed. I rushed AL, hoping to at least get a kill from the CT at A. There he was, aiming his scope at AL entrance, and fired away. ""BOOM!"" He missed, and I threw a molotov, which I had bought earlier, like a greased up frisbee. Fire soon engulfed below him, and a whisper followed, ""rest in peace... IN HELL."" Soon he was dead, charred body on the ground like fried potatoes. Walking over, I looted what rightfully belongs to me, an AWP and a flash grenade. At this point of time, my entire team had already been slaughtered by the four CT beasts that were waiting for their approach. By now, it's just me against them. Hell, I thought for a moment there I was playing Evolve. ""OMG you idiot why did you not follow I said rush B!"", my team mate screamed like a little girl, followed by calls to save the AWP. I made my way^downtown , refusing to listen to my team mate's advices, and was so cocksure that I would clutch this situation. ""Sit down son, watch me."", I said. Time slowed down, heavy breathing could be heard, and I steadied myself. Right then, using guns were means for the weak, and I took my flash grenade and tossed it into B site. It hit the wall, ricocheted what seemed to take a million years, and finally went boom. But before it did, it managed to bring a CT down with it. I jumped through window, with Leeroy Jenkins' will in my heart, finished off another CT, and continued to humiliate the remaining two CTs by evading their gunshots. ""Headshot!"", as I looked to the top right of the screen. One guy had been team killed while they were trying to finish me. I stood there, staring the last guy straight in the eye, as he reloaded his last mag of his M4A1-S. I looked to the ground, began slashing the floor, inviting him to a 1 on 1 knife fight. Success, as he switched to his knife. Charging at me with all of his might, I could feel the rage burning strong in him. ""This is the end..."", I whispered as I jumped, turned a full 360 degree quick switch no scoping headshot. Mic was being spammed, my team cheering for me, and my enemies jeering at me for being a loser who didn't dare to finish the game with a 1 on 1 knife fight.

1424220698,2015-02-18,"So there I was, a lonely little CT recently promoted to a new squad I knew nothing about. Without any time to even introduce ourselves to each other, duty called. HQ immediately sent us out to the inner city, where Terrorists were attempting to bomb the area under the overpass where we CTs were stashing a small cache of supplies. Their vehicles were blocked from entering the locale so they were forced to manually run in and set a bomb right on our stashes. We brought a good amount of Counter Terrorist arsenal and quickly devised a plan to attempt to hold back their 21st wave of Terrorist attacks. We pick up our M4s and AWPs and make way for our designated positions to hold the invading Terrorists back. We sat there and braced ourselves for the attack. The seconds turned into hours as we braced for impact. As we heard the footsteps grow louder, our heart beats grew faster. Suddenly it happened, the first few gunshots. They started when codename: ""Tales"" let his nervousness get the best of him and decided to meet them first by pushing the room the Terrorists were supposedly going to rush out of. His unfortunate blunder led to his tragic demise, but no time to mourn his loss, we had to stop them from destroying our supply cache. I snuck away from the area that ""Tales"" died since codename: ""Dinkleberg"" had kept himself in a position watching that area that they could not get past. So I snuck from bathroom to lower and as I descended the staircase, I hear the growing volume of multiple footsteps, at least 3 pairs of them. I hid against the shelf at the bottom of the first flight of stairs and waited for them to leave out the doors. I knew they decided to switch objectives and go for the stash right under the Overpass so I radioed in my information to my remaining squad mates, ""Max"" and ""Dinkleberg"", since codename: ""Triggers"" had been brutally shot trying to defend the stash they had pushed. I snuck out the doors leading to Stash B and caught a quick glimpse of the back of a Terrorist going into the site. I slowly crept up to the corner and waited. They had already planted the bomb on the site. I radioed in to my team mates that I was in my position and ready for them to create a distraction so I could catch them by their flank off guard. As I waited for the gunshots to commence, the stench of the sewers I had passed over began to get to me, I even was able to distinguish the smell of fried potatoes from the cloud of musk. Then it happened, the gunshots began. I froze for a second, unable to push into the site out of pure fear when I remembered. I remembered the battle cry of one of the greatest soldiers we had been blessed to have fight our fights, Sergeant Leeroy M. Jenkins, made famous for his final battle and the cry he uttered upon his charge into battle, his name. The name ""Leeeerroooooyyyy Jeeeennnkkiiinnnnnsssss!"" echoed in my mind and it snapped me back into reality. A sudden courage arose from inside of me. As I began to push into the site, ""Max"" manages to get a shot off and take down 1 of the 5 Terrorists on site. This brought all of their attentions to ""Max's"" and ""Dinkleberg's"" positions. As they turned to them I passed the corner, immediately catching one of them in my sights. My gun lets out a small bust which brings him down like a chopped tree. Before they realized where I was, I walked a bit further and caught another one with his back turned completely away from me. I heard the footsteps of the third one directly to the right of me and noticed I was almost out of ammo in my M4A1-S. I make the quick and smart decision of switching to my CZ75 and proceed to fire upon him. He also catches wind of my location and fires at me as well. His effort was futile and his bullets seemed to fly right past me, like a fat man attempting to catch a barrage of greased of Frisbees. I panicked as I noticed my CZ75 began to run out of ammo in the clip, but lady luck smiled upon me and the second-to-last bullet in the clip was the finishing one. Aware of the last guy on site I had to think quick, I could not switch weapons for my M4's mag was tapped out, no time to pull it out and reload it. So I kept my CZ in hand and placed the spare mag attached to it into the empty slot. I rapidly survey the area and noticed the enemy was below me, but reloading as well. As we both were reloading, I use my quick thinking and cat-like reflexes to shove the mag right into my weapon, and jump right over his head. Before he could even react to my incredible stunt, I was already behind him with the gun to his head. Without ANY hesitation I pulled, and held, the trigger for a small burst into the back of his skull. They were all dead. ""Max"" rushed into the site to defuse the bomb and the remaining of us were able to rest easy, knowing that we had defeated them. However, in the hype of the moment, we did not realize that we had only won the battle and the war was not yet over. In the midst of our calming down, HQ calls. ""Good work men. You stopped this wave of Terrorists but you are not done, at least not yet. Our intel states that a 22nd wave of 5 Terrorists is coming to give it yet another try. We unfortunately can't pull you out but can only send in a very small batch of reinforcements to help you stop them. We wish you the best of luck here. HQ, out."" It appeared as if break time was over and we returned to the drop zone to greet and prepare the new recruits for the fight. As I pat the back of the newest one, I grab a helmet, place it one his head and say, ""Suit up kid, cause they are going to eat you up like fried potatoes on Thanksgiving."" He let out a nervous chuckle after my little speech. Then, his radio went off. ""Terrorists have begun to push out of their improvised base and are making way to the caches."" Confidence took over. I form a small grin, grabbed the M4A4s out of the small supply drop that came with the recruits and tossed it at them. I turn to them and said, ""Let's go, boys."" We dashed off and, after a few more waves of domination, we had won. We kept the Overpass secure and returned to HQ. We all agreed to go and take leave to go home to our families. Our peace was disturbed as we were called back to fight. Almost all of us didn't make home after the battle of codname: ""Dust II"". I was the only survivor after we lost the area.

1424323416,2015-02-19,"i've been looking for an m4a1s skin, still can't find one i really like but something with sentimental value is key so i understand you completely. story time: Once upon a time, there was a potato. But not any ordinary potato, he aspired to be the best he could be, to protect his town as a Potato Cowboy Sheriff! Ever since he was a *small fry*, he vowed to keep his eyes *peeled* and to be ready for anything. It was not a luxurious job, but some spud had to do it. Armed with cobalt dual berettas, Cowboy Potato was always trying to climb the ropes, keep the town safe, and eventually, make it as Sherrif. One lonely night, while he was on patrol, he heard rustling in the wind. Out of nowhere, three vegetable bandits sprang out from the bushes, armed with gleaming desert eagles. ""We're here to rob the town, run before we mash you!"" cried the Tomato, Carrot and Broccoli. ""Not on my watch"" and with dualies blazing, Potato fired sporadically. In the blink of a sprout, the bandits had their pistols shot from their grasps. Hearing the commotion, the townspeople came out and cheered the Potato for his valor. In the morning, the whole town came out to really *butter* up Potato. He was declared Supreme Cowboy Potato Sherrif and to the end of his days, he kept the town safe.

1424894811,2015-02-25,"It was on Nuke, I was soloQing. We were on CT and the T's planted on A. It had there was only one T left, he was somewhere on A site. I was the last on my team and I was about to go up the vents to A site all sneaky beaky like. Back then I still had my old keybinds (throw item in G, can you already guess what happened?). So there I was, slowly climbing up the left vent with my M4A1-S Guardian in hand ready to shoot the last guy. I spotted him sneaking in front of the white silo things on A. This next part is a bit fuzzy, since I had no idea what caused me to panic (could've been the sudden realization that the T was right there in front of me) but somehow I slightly paniced and somehow managed to DROP my M4 down the vent! That caused me to panic even more, the T noticed me and threw a nade down the vent (since I dropped down to pick my weapon back up). And I died to the nade... Afterwards my team was not pleased at all and tried to kick me, but luckily I was saved by one kind person. Let's just say that I kept on saying ""I'm so sorry"" for the rest of the game.. lol After that game I changed my keybinds so that I would never ever accidentally drop weapons. https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=59245272&amp;token=cXUueC1Z",0.123,0.775,0.102,-0.6905,2

The Famas Spitfire.Now the reason I really want the skin is somewhat interesting. Basically this one skin reminds of me the greatest skin in the world the Master Piece M4A1 sadly enough that is way beyond my price range and I dont think I would be able to drop $180 on it so of course I looked around for something that is very similar to it. This is when I came across this little gem the spitfire. I absolutely love its mouth design which reminds me of a shark(aka my favorite animal amongst octopi and megaladons &lt;&lt; my favorite shark). I also enjoy the graffiti texture of the skin which reminds me a lot of the master piece m4a1. Thank you for doing this giveaway btw! and Cheers OP! :P,0.042,0.743,0.215,0.9832,1

My favorite experience with the nova is when we were losing 2-15 on dust 2 in comp,T side,and I decided to take drastic measures. Every round I would run down suicide flash as I started to run down, and one more as I started to go through double doors. I got 2 kills, and my team won. 3-15, and I felt a comeback coming. I did it again, and got 1 kill before I got killed by an AWP at CT. I convince my whole team to do it next round. 4-15 and we all rushed down, with an auto sniper waiting for us. I smoked double doors and had my team wait. We were stuck in mid and I came around B and got the CT with the auto sniper. T had 3 left, and CT had 4 left. We went to grab the bomb, and decided to do the unexpected, and rush long. We went and found no one waiting, and pushed up, but we forgot one crucial thing. THE PIT. 1 of us died, and I was lit for 60, with 40 HP left before my teammate managed to kill the guy in pit. All through the match we had seen weapons, but we decided to stick with our trusty novas, and now was no exception, but the m4a1-s was tempting. At 3-2 we knew it would be hard, but we did it for gaben. I went and ran distraction at A, getting one who was hiding at site. 2-2 And it was fairly even. One more came A, and I threw a picked up decoy at goose to distract him, meanwhile my teammate hat taken one out at B side, but was lit heavily. I came to him. Currently I had picked up a Smoke, a flash, and a Molotov. My teammate had but a nade. We planted at a position that we could watch from most angles. I waited at car, and my now dear teammate waited next to window, looking up at it. All the sudden we heard foot steps. Our 1 forsworn enemy was coming. We saw him poke out tuns, and I shot him twice, but my very own gun, the gun that I loved , betrayed me. He was lit 2 for 56. It was all up to my teammate, who had 10-15 health left. He played it smart and hid, and waited for the defusing noises, then got the filthy CT. 5-15. All the sudden we looked at the chat ""knife fight mid?"" Asked the CTs. We foolishly trusted them. I bought nothing besides a Zeus, the ultimate weapon. We came at them with full force, all 5 players. They only came with 4, and we assumed that they were keeping one to flank us. Oh how wrong we were. The knife fight was going well for my wonder team, we still had 4 left and the 3. We rushed one, singling him it from the hers, and with stock knife fury, ripped him to shreds. 2 left, and still that missing player. We managed to get them down to 1 player, who was lit for a stab, before it happened. Like the talon of god we heard the sharp, unmistakable report of an auto sniper. It was over in seconds, and we barely heard the game say ""counter-terrorists win."" We said GG, but we didn't feel it. We didn't feel it at all.

My fmy funniest moment is with the nova when we were losing 2-15 on dust 2 in comp,T side,and I decided to take drastic measures. Every round I would run down suicide flash as I started to run down, and one more as I started to go through double doors. I got 2 kills, and my team won. 3-15, and I felt a comeback coming. I did it again, and got 1 kill before I got killed by an AWP at CT. I convince my whole team to do it next round. 4-15 and we all rushed down, with an auto sniper waiting for us. I smoked double doors and had my team wait. We were stuck in mid and I came around B and got the CT with the auto sniper. T had 3 left, and CT had 4 left. We went to grab the bomb, and decided to do the unexpected, and rush long. We went and found no one waiting, and pushed up, but we forgot one crucial thing. THE PIT. 1 of us died, and I was lit for 60, with 40 HP left before my teammate managed to kill the guy in pit. All through the match we had seen weapons, but we decided to stick with our trusty novas, and now was no exception, but the m4a1-s was tempting. At 3-2 we knew it would be hard, but we did it for gaben. I went and ran distraction at A, getting one who was hiding at site. 2-2 And it was fairly even. One more came A, and I threw a picked up decoy at goose to distract him, meanwhile my teammate hat taken one out at B side, but was lit heavily. I came to him. Currently I had picked up a Smoke, a flash, and a Molotov. My teammate had but a nade. We planted at a position that we could watch from most angles. I waited at car, and my now dear teammate waited next to window, looking up at it. All the sudden we heard foot steps. Our 1 forsworn enemy was coming. We saw him poke out tuns, and I shot him twice, but my very own gun, the gun that I loved , betrayed me. He was lit 2 for 56. It was all up to my teammate, who had 10-15 health left. He played it smart and hid, and waited for the defusing noises, then got the filthy CT. 5-15. All the sudden we looked at the chat ""knife fight mid?"" Asked the CTs. We foolishly trusted them. I bought nothing besides a Zeus, the ultimate weapon. We came at them with full force, all 5 players. They only came with 4, and we assumed that they were keeping one to flank us. Oh how wrong we were. The knife fight was going well for my wonder team, we still had 4 left and the 3. We rushed one, singling him it from the hers, and with stock knife fury, ripped him to shreds. 2 left, and still that missing player. We managed to get them down to 1 player, who was lit for a stab, before it happened. Like the talon of god we heard the sharp, unmistakable report of an auto sniper.

1432079288,2015-05-19,"If you wanted to get him something based on looks, I would check out [CS GO Stash](http://csgostash.com/) and see what you like there. It's a website that has all the available skins in CS GO sorted by collection, weapon, condition, rarity, and price, as well as other search perameters, that should be helpful. Generally, the skins that are going to be used the most in game are going to be more expensive. The AK-47, M4A1-S, M4A4, and AWP are going to be the more expensive skins. Some pistols can be a little pricey but not as much as the rifles. If I were you, I wouldn't blow 150 on a single skin. I would get a set of skins for the more common guns. For example, and this is very subjective and I am in no way telling you what skins to get, I would get something like * Glock - Dragon Tattoo FN * P2000 - Amber Fade FN or USP-S Guardian FN * Tec-9 - Titanium Bit FN * Five-Seven - Copper Galaxy FN * P250 - Supernova FN * ST AK-47 - Redline FT * AWP - Redline MW * ST M4A4 - Dragon King MW or M4A1-S - Guardian MW * Bayonet - Stained MW That's what I'd get if I was gonna spend 150 ish dollars on cs go skins. I just put that together and added it all up, based on the listed prices on csgostash, that comes out to $166.62. Like I said, I'd get a set of higher mid ranged skins instead of 1 expensive skin.",0.018,0.933,0.049,0.743,3
1432079726,2015-05-19,That is interesting. Somebody else also linked CSGO Stash. I have not seen that site but it is helping a lot. I think I will use it a lot over the next day or so. I think I have to sit down with a list. You bring up a good idea. If I spend less on the knife I can get him some of these other skins. The M4A1-S Guardian looks very cool. I saw a 400$ M4A1-s next to it and almost fell out of my chair.,0.0,0.857,0.143,0.8977,3

1433899814,2015-06-10,"**First decision:** If you're not in love with StatTrak right now, DON'T buy any StatTrak. It's a pointless feature (As you can just farm kills like many do), it makes everything way more expensive (Thus reducing your inventory) and it also rules out some cool-looking weapons from the list of buyables. **Second decision:** Do you really want to get a Knife right now? Cause if you do, you're going to have low margin for other weapons, so choose wisely... **Third decision:** Many &amp; small price with decent looks or small amount &amp; very expensive with epic looks? This is because there are the people who HAVE to have a skin for each weapon, and then there's those who just have a skin for the thing they really want and use. Select your option and read on... **Fourth decision:** Weapon priorities, you prefer to skin up the weapons you use the most (Ex: AK47) OR the weapons you hate their looks the most (Ex: Stock Glock)? This, although not very important, has it's weight on the final decision. **Fifth and last decision:** So you have in your mind your decisions about StatTrak, about a Knife, about looking good and cheap or epic and expensive and which weapons you need a skin first the most, NOW it's the time! There is a very cool website (PM if you want the link, IDK if mods approve link postages.) that allows you to view all the skins of that weapon and their current price ranges, and even directly inspect the weapon in the best quality there is ingame. On that website, you will select the skins you like the most. **Final notes/Recommendations:** In true honesty, nobody can tell you ""Buy this"" and ""Buy that"", as everyone's taste is different, so I think your request on this post is a bit weird and unnecessary, as you will decide for yourself in the end anyways :P Also I recommend you to first make a little list of what you liked for the weapons you selected to be blessed with a skin, and buy afterwards, as we tend to select many and, if we buy right away, we might end with no more money and a very important weapon without a skin! You should also buy during the night (Depends on your timezone though), as everyday there is a general lowering of the prices, up to 0.50c each weapon, which can lead to nice saves on a big-scale shopping! Also, there are good looking skins for 0.10 - 0.50c range, and with 5$ or less you can get a decent looking skin on almost all weapons of the game (That was what I did when I first started CSGOing) To end my wall of text now, here's the (HUGE) list of my suggestions for the most common needed weapons: **» WEAPON: Cheap skin - Medium skin - Expensive skin - I would buy** » **Glock**: Catacombs - Blue Fissure, Steel Disruption, Candy Apple - Water Elemental - 4th » **P2000**: Ivory, Pulse - Amber Fade, Handgun - Scorpion, Fire Elemental - 4th » **USP-S**: Blood Tiger - Stainless, Torque, Guardian - Orion - 4th » **Tec-9**: Urban DDPAT, Isaac - Red Quartz, Ossified, Blue Titanium - Titanium Bit - 3rd » **Es-57**: Kami, Silver Quartz, Urban Hazard - Copper Galaxy - Monkey Business - 2nd » **Deagle**: Urban DDPAT, Urban Rubble - Crimson Web, Naga - Cobalt Disruption, Conspiracy, Pilot - 7th » **MP7**: Urban Hazard, Armor Core - Skulls, Anodized Navy - Nemesis - 3rd » **Bizon**: Cobalt Halftone - Osiris, Blue Streak - Rust Coat - 2nd » **P90**: Module, Elite Build - Virus, Desert Warfare - Asiimov - 5th » **UMP**: Corporal, Labyrinth, Indigo - Caramel - Blaze - 3rd » **AK-47**: Elite Build - Emerald Pinstripe, COLOR Laminate, Redline, Cartel - Wasteland Rebel, Vulcan - 6th » **M4A4**: Griffin - Desert-Strike, Evil Daimyo, Dragon King - Asiimov - 5th » **M4A1-S**: Basilisk - Atomic Alloy, Nitro, Blood Tiger, Guardian - Cyrex - 5th » **AWP**: Worm God - Electric Hive, Redline; Man'O'War, Graphite, BOOM - Asiimov, Lightning Strike - 5/6th » **Scout**: Abyss, Slashed - Acid Fade - Detour - 4th » **Galil**: Kami, Tuxedo, Blue Titanium, Rocket Pop - Cerberus, Eco - 5th » **Famas**: Doomkitty - Sergeant - Pulse - 3rd » **SG553**: Traveler, Anodized Navy - Pulse, Ultraviolet - 3rd » **AUG**: Wings, Torque - Anodized Navy - 3rd » **Knifes**: Flip, Huntsman - Bayonet, M9 Bayonet - Karambit, Butterfly - 4th » **Knife skins**: Forest DDPAT, Stained, Rust Coat, Ultraviolet, Night - 1st **My number**: 75 **My trade link**: https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=58881106&amp;token=YcTvtZrS **Ps**: CZ-75, Dual Berettas, P250, Nova, XM1014, Sawed, MAG-7, M249, Negev, MP9, Mac-10, G3SG1 and SCAR-20...

Now on subject, the Dragon King is one of my favorite skins, and it's not about the gun's qualities (being classified/M4A4 and being Silver Elite for playing CS:GO from the laptop when I'm bored, lol), it's about it's looks.. I mean c'mon.. why would you trade/bet such a cool skin? It's got literally everything in it, a huge logo with a daring dragon, that eastern-asian-specific terrace pattern that can be found nearly everywhere, surrounding the dragon, and on top of that, a ST FN skin? FN would've been enough (I for one have a FT one with MW look, checked the market for 40 minutes and inspected every gun for like 3 pages just to get it with a ~0.15-0.16 float, something notable for a guy that has added his own money to get a load of skins after making a return into CS:GO after giving his things to friends).. Back to my point, why would you bet/trade such a nice item? C'mon, you must be crazy.. I mean, yeah, 30 bucks, but if you prefer an M4A1-S - Cyrex that can be taken off the ground whenever you play on Casual or competitive community servers over this one.. it's just your choice I suppose, but I'd take this one all day over the Breakout M4..

But I do really love the looks of the Dragon King, this is my favorite gun ever and in small maps like Office I'd rather use the M4A4 over the M4A1-S due to the magazine size. I used to have a non ST Dragon King which I sadly had to use to trade for a M4A1-S. I still think it's a shame that I used it in a trade even though I use the M4A1-S more.

So as a math guy, this is an excellent fit for me as I will be able to keep accurate records of who I have been slaying with this weapon. I then can make colorful graphs and engaging pies charts with those numbers. Who doesn't love some good data being visualized!?! Now, the M4A4 has a special place in my heart as a player. As much as I like the stealth of the M4A1-S, I sometimes like to make noise. This bad boy will do the job. It is favored over the AK because I suck with the AK. This is a finely crafted machine for the hands of an expert. Lastly, this skins speaks volumes to me. Being of British ancestry, dragon's have been/still are a major issue in the UK. Perhaps acquiring this will help mend some bridges that have caused such hostilities between brits and dragons.

1436503178,2015-07-10,"$90(CAD) = $70(USD) In my opinion you already have some really cool skins(Sun In Leo) and some that could be sold on the marketplace to add to your budget. For example if you sold the P90 | Asiimov (~$6), AWP | Electric (~$7), and the Glock-18 | Water (~$3) that would bring your total budget to roughly about $85. With that said the following list is based on if you sell those skins. * AK-47 | Jaguar (Minimal Wear) ~ $18 * M4A1-S | Atomic Alloy (Factory New) ~ $17 * Glock-18 | Water Elemental (Factory New) ~ $8 * USP-S | Orion (Factory New) ~ $10 * P90 | Asiimov (Factory New) ~ $20 * M4A4 | 龍王 (Dragon King) (Factory New) ~ $8 This leaves about $4 left over if any of the prices change or if you want so save some for something. This following list is if you do not sell any of the skins you currently have in your inventory. * AK-47 | Jaguar (Minimal Wear) ~ $18 * M4A1-S | Atomic Alloy (Factory New) ~ $17 * USP-S | Caiman (Factory New) ~ $5 * StatTrak™ M4A4 | 龍王 (Dragon King) (Minimal Wear) ~ $19 * MAC-10 | Neon Rider (Factory New) ~ $10 Not much left over if the prices don't change too much. Or you could just buy a knife. * ★ Gut Knife | Blue Steel (Minimal Wear) ~ $67 Or buy one knife and one skin. * ★ Gut Knife | Night (Field-Tested) ~ $52 * AK-47 | Jaguar (Minimal Wear) ~ $18 And finally here is what I would buy. * M4A1-S | Guardian (Factory New) ~ $11 * AK-47 | Cartel (Factory New) ~ $5 * Glock-18 | Night (Factory New) ~ $7 * USP-S | Caiman (Factory New) ~ $4 * M4A4 | 龍王 (Dragon King) (Factory New) ~ $8 * P90 | Trigon (Minimal Wear) ~ $4 * AWP | Sun in Leo (Factory New) ~ $10 (Sell the MW in you inv) * MAC-10 | Neon Rider (Factory New) ~ $10 * Five-SeveN | Monkey Business (Field-Tested) ~ $3 * P250 | Cartel (Factory New) ~ $6 That leaves $2 left over just in case prices rise. But in the end, our definition of cool might differ from yours; so I suggest just looking at some skins on the Steam Marketplace or even looking at each Operation Page on counter-strike.net which show off a lot of skins. * http://www.counter-strike.net/operationbloodhound/ * http://www.counter-strike.net/operationbreakout/ * http://blog.counter-strike.net/armsdeal/ * http://www.counter-strike.net/operationphoenix/ * http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2014/02/8644/ * http://blog.counter-strike.net/operationbravo/",0.0,0.974,0.026,0.7842,1

Every game, my team would push out from spawn, and towards one of the bombsites, encounter some enemies, and then the LEM smurf would push in behind us and shoot us all in the back of the head. No one could match his reflexes or game knowledge. So I had a bright idea. Two of my teammates holed up at T spawn while I held Logs and watched our backs as the other two pushed up banana, we got a two for two trade on our way to B site, but then the smurf came from behind again and cleared out my remaining two friends as they tried to hold off the rear offensive. I took a chance and peeked him, and I one tapped him in the head with my p250 and took his m4a1s. I grabbed bomb and flashed car before rushing out middle, only to come face to face with a second enemy pushing from A site. I sprayed him down in one quick burst before juking through apartments and jumping down from balcony. I planted the bomb on A site and turned to jump back up to balcony when I got hit in the back and dropped to 26 health. I made it up to balcony and ran through apartments before walking back and waiting. He tapped the bomb defusal, and I knew I had to peek him. I peeked, and found that he had walked his way to truck, so with a quick twitch, I sprayed him down through the railing and won my team our first round.

They're called M4A1, and their leader is a quiet son of bitch named ''S''. Last time we met we started comparing skins, after some close encounters, I showed them my ultimate P250 sand dune. Even the other gang was impressed. I thought the battle was over. But then.. he proceeded to show the thing he was waiting for all night.. the M4A4 - URBAN DOPAT [FT]. Even though it's such a great skin, my gang brothers trusted me, so it was time for me to show my ultimate AK. I didn't have it. I was in complete desperation. My dawgs were waiting for me to make a move, but I didn't.. ''I-I.. ha-have a default AK skin''. For one moment everybody went quiet. Then all of M4A1 started laughing and they went home with that humiliating victory, as some of my boys left me, and went with him instead. Only 4 stayed with me.. they still believe in the comeback.

A month or so later, my friend Oliver got a $15 Desert Eagle Sunset Storm, and we all flipped our shit, thinking it was the coolest thing. About three weeks ago, my friend Josh was in a DM, and his bloodhound rank up drop was a FN M4A1S Hot Rod, which clocks in close to $190. We curled up into fetal positions, cried, and then decided to castrate Josh, for Gaben himself had blessed him. The most expensive in game drop I've gotten is 20 cents. I'm waiting for Gaben to drop me a Dragon Lore and commence the Rapture, but it doesn't seem very likely. It hurts my heart. But yeah, the reason I want the cases is because I'm doing a huge case opening on my birthday on the 25th, or maybe after the party on the 27th, and this would help me a bunch. https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=167173735&amp;token=S6lkefPS",0.076,0.774,0.151,0.9156,1

1444091644,2015-10-06,"Being scammed can feel like a bunch of things, but in the end, it's supreme regret and self-pummeling for at least a little while. I've been scammed twice and somehow hacked once, and two of them involved around 50-60 dollars lost while another was a birthday present lost. First one was a phishing bot in CSGOLounge, messaging me about how I've been posting trades too frequently and they needed to ""check if my items were valid."" I was a lounge noobie, only 4 days in, of course I made a stupid mistake. However, since I *had* been posting trades quite frequently, I fell for it and didn't see ""CSGOLournge."" WW AK Vulcan, FN AWP Electric Hive, BS StatTrak M4A1-S Basilisk, FT StatTrak Desert Eagle Heirloom, all gone. I just wished my friend didn't just say ""lol"" when I asked him if it was legit or not. He obviously knew it was a scam but didn't bother telling me. Second one happened around June of 2015, all found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofcsgo/comments/38yh5k/i_am_disappointed_but_i_will_still_giveaway_a_mw/) It's a long story, but generous people of this subreddit really made the recovery possible and I'm forever grateful. Gives me the motivation to giveaway every other week! Third one, happened just a few weeks ago. My brother gifted me a BS Gut Knife rust coat. I was the happiest in months, but overnight, somehow, someone hacked into my account and *BET* the knife on an EnVyUs vs NiP game, I guess the hacker's intention was to bet, win, then take whatever the winnings were and send everything to his account or sell it or whatever. I woke up to the email notification just to see my knife bet on the lounge in the middle of the night and EnVyUs lost to NiP with 80-20 odds. What's funny is that I would've bet on NiP but I guess the hacker was a NiP hater. Too bad, he would've won me $200 dollars. In all, being scammed, to me, feels like you've had a part of you ripped from you at the time being. Whether you recover from it or not is your choice but at the time of the scam, one most definitely will feel the worst of the worst, mostly of ""how the *FUCK* did I *FALL FOR THAT??*?"" But yeah. I guess I'll see myself out, what a nonsensical ramble .-. Edit: Methods of not being scammed, ever. 1. Check the price and make sure the email and trade offer match what you want! This is a virtual world you're dealing with, TAKE YOUR TIME AND MAKE SENSE. 2. SET UP STEAM GUARD. 3. Always check the profile, its comments, its inventory, and his STEAMREP. 4. If someone else asks you to trade or ""test"" the skin out, deny that shit, or, if you really trust them, make them trade YOU an item of EQUAL value so they will think twice before scamming YOU as YOU have THEIR item. 5. If you're having a sticker-on-gun exchange, MAKE THEM GET IN GAME AND LOAD UP A COMPETITIVE WITH YOU. They will not be able to scratch stickers off in game and you can choose whether to accept the offer in your STEAM browser. It's a thing! That's all I got. Ouch my fingers.",0.105,0.765,0.13,0.9313,2

I had been in secret so I sneaked into vents and sneakily climbed up the ladder to take a look where the enemies were. I spotted out one and was about to hop out of the vent and kill him when one of the T's suddenly jumped in front/past the vent where I was! It scared the shit out of me and I in startled panic state pressed G (throw weapon) and threw my M4A1-S right down the vent making noise! My teammates were facepalming so hard as I quickly dropped down to the vent to pick up my gun. But just as I was about to come back up and carry on, the T's rushed me and killed me and we lost the round... Then I met a votekick but thankfully someone pressed F2 and I remained in the game until the end. In the end we won the game and right afterward I changed my throw weapon key to H so it's further away and I don't experience the same anymore!

1446694146,2015-11-05,"/u/PunCakess you're insane. And I thought doing two giveaways in a week was good of me. I think the history of my CS career is quite a strange one, so I guess any part of my CS history is ""memorable,"" but I remember the reason of why I play CS as much as I do today. I never wanted to get better, I just wanted to play with people on DM and Casual, and played with default skins, and just flew around maps in high settings to appreciate the graphics. At this time, I only had around 13 hours into the game, maybe 7 just flying around killing bots. Howvever, one day, my school held a competition for CS:GO, my (Gold Nova) friends wanted me to be in their team, and I said ""Sure, I guess it couldn't hurt."" I guess it did, as some senior (I was a sophomore back then) on my team, who decided to queue up with me (He was MG1, I was Nova 1) got all ragey because I was Nova 1 and missing shots against MGEs and such, and proceeded to bad-mouth me to the entirety of the upperclassmen. I got a bad rep and apparently even my queue buddies were not even playing with me anymore, as I had just gotten into competitive here and then. Well, this made me quite angry as he had around 500 hours and I only had 13, and he jeered at me in such a terrible tone that I literally wanted to castrate his pathetic soul. I decided I'd do it in game someday. Grinded around 200 hours in DM, learning recoil control, playing with some friends in 10-mans to learn my role (I'm playing Support Role and secondary AWPer for my 5 man I never play a queue without), learning first bullet accuracy, when to spray and not spray, and the end of the year competition came up, prize at stake was 2 $50 Steam Cards. Half a year ago, I was Nova 1, going 4-19 bottom frag against MGEs while a MG1 jeered at me for sucking with 13 hours into the game. At the end of my sophomore year, I was MGE, he was LE, but that competition, he ended up throwing an empty can of Monster at me as I'd hold any A site with an M4A1-S and survive 80% of the time. Final score was 16-13, me second frag with 17-9, and Mister-I-Jeer-At-Nova-1s-When-They're-New went 11-20, half those deaths coming from me. It was quite a memorable moment in Counter Strike. Uhm, I'd like to choose ~183~. Here is my profile: http://steamcommunity.com/id/toufusoup/inventory/ (You bet your ass I'm gonna giveaway if I win this. Just kidding, this is probably the most pathetic high school drama ever and I probably won't win anything.

I don't know why but for some reason the Emerald Pinstripe makes it feel as if your AK gets skinnier and more precise. AUG: FN Wings AWP: MW Pit Viper or any Worm God. The only wear it gets is that it gets darker. CZ-Auto: MW Tigris Desert Eagle: Urban Rubble, preferably FN or MW. Dualies: Dueling Dragons (God they're good) FAMAS: Survivor Zs or Doomkitties, both MW. Five-SeveN: Kamis or Urban Hazards. Perhaps a Fowl Play. G3: Green Apple or Flux. Galil-AR: Urban Rubble or Chatterbox. Glock-18: I personally like the Wraiths. The little green sights take the cake. M249: Nebula Crusader. For sure. M4A1-S: Perhaps the Basilisk or the Nitro. They're quite simplistic and look good both in low and high shaders. M4A4: Griffin, Daybreak, Jungle Tiger, or a clean Desert Strike. (Oh, and maybe a Dragon King) Mac-10: Rangeen, Neon Rider, Silver, or Candy Apple. MAG-7: Heat and or Heaven Guard. MP7: Armor Core or Special Delivery. Delicious. MP9: Ruby Poison Dart, or a Rose Iron. Negev: Desert Strike or the Loudmouth. I dunno. There aren't many skins for 'em. Nova: Ooh, Rising Skull, any of the Apples, or the Ghost Camo. P2000: Scorpion, Pulse, Handgun, or Corticera. P250: Franklin, Wingshot, Supernova, or Hive. Because not the bees. P90: Module, Blind Spot, Elite Build, or the Asiimov. Sawed-Off: Serenity. I can supply you with a MW one if you want to giveaway. SCAR: Grotto, Crimson Web, or the Cyrex. No doubt about it. SG553: Cyrex, Pulse, or the Anodized Navy. SSG-08: Tropical Storm, Acid Fade, Detour, or Mayan Dashed. Tec-9: Blue Titanium, Titanium Bit, or Isaac. UMP-45: Grand Prix, Riot, or the Carbon Fiber.

1447120224,2015-11-10,"AK redline w/ denis cologne 2015 autograph - If sticker is placed in the right place, looks like it says penis ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) USP-S Torque - I use the orion but the torque looks just as good and is a lot cheaper. Glock Blue Fissure: Unlike most glock skins, covers the whole gun. P90 Module - Cheap and good looking. Five-Seven Nightshade - Underused and good looking skin, you will probs get many compliments. Tec-9 Isaac - Good looking skin, not much else to say. SSG-08 Acid Fade - One of the only good looking scouts out there. P250 Supernova - Cheap and good looking, also consider the wingshot. P2000 Handgun - Cheap skin that does not have wear, looks cool. Dual Berettas Dualing Dragons - Cheap and good looking. Desert Eagle Midnight Storm - A bit pricey but you should definitely get it Factory New with a decent float, looks great. CZ75- Auto Victoria - One of the cheapest reds in the game, and it dosen't have wear, it just gets darker the worse the wear is (BS=FN) so you can buy a BS/FT and it'll still look great. PP-Bizon osiris - Cool looking skin, not much else to be said. MP7 Nemesis - Pretty cheap pink and a good deal if you use the MP7 a lot. Mac-10 Heat - Less pricey than the neon rider and looks nice. MP9 Rose Iron - Pretty good lookin gun. UMP-45 Corporal - Nice looking cheap gun. AUG Torque - Cheaper and better looking than the chameleon. AWP Man-o'-war - One of the cheaper red awp skins, might not have a skin on the scope but still looks pretty pretty. FAMAS Survivor Z - I would recommend the pulse but it looks beat up even in Factory new, but the survivor Z looks good in and coondition. G3SG1 Murky - You probably arent going to use this much, so buying a flux would probably be a bad idea, and this is a nice skin regardless. Galil AR Rocket Pop - One of the better Galil skins out there, and very cheap. M4A1-S Blood Tiger - Cheap for an M4 skin, looks pretty good regardless. M4A4 Griffin - Cool design, looks much better in-game than the icon. SCAR-20 Grotto - Nice skin if you don't use the auto much, if you do I would reccomend the Cardiac or the emerald. SG 553 Pulse - Cool skin, not much to say. SSG 08 Acid Fade - One of the best looking scouts, vary cheap too. Mag-7 Heaven Guard - Super cheap and good looking. Nova Ghost Camo - Also super cheap. Sawed-Off Origami - good enough for the worst gun in the game, if you use it a lot use the kraken. XM1014 Red Python - Also good enough, if you use it often use bone machine/heaven guard/tranquility. M249 System lock - good looking skin for a terrible gun Negev Nuclear Waste - Cheap and cool. Knives: Under 20$? Glhf trying to find that.",0.067,0.652,0.281,0.9992,2

1447855561,2015-11-18,"certainly the most beneficial to the community-at-large would be a large pile of smaller priced skins, in order to spread the love to as many people as possible. Some people aren't able to afford to put money into the game, and it'd be nice for them to have some skins for their guns, even if it's full inventories of 0.05$ to 0.10$ skins (I have a few friends that I play with that are in that same boat, and i've donated them all the low-cost skins that I picked up from the market when I started playing, and they're quite happy with getting free stuff.) That being said, the ""lottery winner"" feeling of being able to be the one to claim that you got a HyperBeast or a MW Asiimov from a giveaway is an amazing feeling as well, and though you might only provide boundless joy for 1 or 2 people, you'd be really making someone's christmas. One thing I'd suggest if you're thinking about going towards a higher item cost giveaway, is to ask for inventory links, or to look through a person's profile... sometimes new players will come here looking for freebies, but othertimes, you have people who are floating in knives, keys, and DragonLores in the mix as well, trying to scalp higher cost items. I know that the sub is free to use for everyone, and I don't believe that those people are any less deserving, but it kinda sours the deal when you notice that the winner's gotten a nice 30$ Cyrex or something, and they're likely just going to turn around and sell it on the market/trade it for keys. that's just my 0.02$... For myself, the biggest/best item I got from a giveaway here was a FN Dualing Dragons dual berretas, valued at 7$. I've since poured about 30$ into the game via the market, trying to Stat Trak all my weapons (missing the Bizon, M4A4, M4A1-S, AWP, SCAR20 &amp; G3SG1 autosnipers, along with a knife, to complete the set)",0.011,0.857,0.132,0.9862,2

You know, that one that pretty much nobody likes. The maps were pretty sub par and the skins were generally shit. But I digress. I was queuing with a friend for the Vanguard maps, just to try them out. We got into [Marquis](http://counterstrike.wikia.com/wiki/Marquis) and had no clue what to do. Now, before I continue the story, I have to tell you that my friend and I have a habit of trying out really, REALLY stupid tactics that seem to work 2/3 of the time. This game went pretty solid for most of the time, with it coming out to a 15-14 win-or-tie moment. It was just my friend and I on CT against 3 T-side players. I was in my lurk spot and my friend needed me to rotate in. I was thinking ""alright, if this goes wrong, we tie"" so I said to distract them. Whipping out a Negev off the floor, he chucked a decoy and started spraying down the hallway they were going through. They (and I) could hardly hear, so I took the opportunity to rush up behind them and whip out my knife. They still hadn't saw/heard me, so I proceeded to knife them. SHLICK SHCLICK SHLICK! 3 backstabs, 3 kills. In the end we won the game and I got a M4A1-S Nitro FT as a drop. All in all, it was a fairly fun game.

1449230363,2015-12-04,"[Trade link](https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=64936147&amp;token=URTsCGNA) Suggestions: It looks like you're going for a blue theme, so I have two lines of recommendations. You could let a little green leak into the blue (or go for the RvB thing that someone else did a while back, but I won't suggest that since the inventory looks less nice), or you could go harder on the blue. **Pistols** ----------- I suggest grabbing a **CZ75-Auto | Poison Dart** in the chance that the CZ becomes amazing again. The Emerald is probably a little bright for your set. Desert Eagle | Midnight Storm is a nice skin, but Cobalt Disruption fits better, so no change there. You're running the Forest Night right now, but if you'll consider the **Five-Seven | Jungle**, you might be able to make the part-green inventory work. **Glock-18 | Bunsen Burner** fits your inventory scheme better than Blue Fissue since like the other pistols, it's a brighter, shinier blue. I see you're running the USP-S | Guardian, but you might consider the **P2000 | Ocean Foam** or **Pulse**, or if you want to stick with the USP-S, **Royal Blue**. **Tec-9 | Titanium Bit** is brighter than the Blue Titanium. I suggest the **Dual Berettas | Urban Shock** over Cobalt Quartz. **Rifles** -------------- If you've got the cash, the **AUG | Anodized Navy** is superior to Storm. Your Galil-AR should definitely be **Cold Stone** over Rocket Pop - Rocket Pop is nice by itself, but clashes with the rest of the T-side skins. The ideal M4A1-S is the Icarus Fell, but you don't have the cash to throw at that, I'm guessing. Who does? Not me. Consider the **SCAR-20 | Grotto** or **Emerald**. **SMGs** -------------- I recommend the **PP-Bizon | Blue Streak**. Consider the **P90 | Glacier Mesh** to mesh with the stormy theme you have going. Consider the **Nova | Moon In Libra** for a brighter blue, though again, your Tempest fits with the storm theme. **Heavy** ---------------- I recommend the XM1014 | Varicamo Blue. Consider the **Negev | Anodized Navy** short of picking up the **AWP | Man o' War** as well. That's all the suggestions I've got :) Nice picks for the rest. Edit: Also upgrade those MW skins to FN for that extra flair :) No gray spots allowed.

1457928424,2016-03-14,"Mo Why the fudge should I win? Let me spin you a yarn. I was backpacking across western europe in barcelona in mount tibidabo, when suddenly I saw a tree that had the letters ""M4A1-S"" carved into it. I didn't think much of it and kept going. Then came another tree, and on it was carved ""Basilisk."" I had no idea what this meant so I just kept mindlessly marching on. And you guessed it, on yet ANOTHER tree was written, ""battle scarred."" Right after I read it I saw an arrow flying towards me. It hit me in my knee and my vision slowly began to fade and I blacked out. I woke up tied in rope. I couldn't move a muscle. I noticed I was elevated about three feet above the ground with the help of this wooden contraption onto which my rope was tied. I noticed my back was feeling really hot; a burning sensation. I turned my head as far back behind me as I could and realized there was a fire under me! Then I saw this tribal man who was dressed in nothing but a brown cloth covering his genitals slowly turning the wooden rod to which I was attached to. It hit me. I was being cooked alive! There were hundreds of other tribal men chanting and singing. It took me a while to make out what they were saying, but they were chanting ""STAT TRACK, STAT TRACK, STAT TRACK."" I was so utterly shocked and confused that I wasn't even able to scream for help. As I was being turned back around to face the crisp night sky once again, I saw a flash of light. I saw a figure coming towards me. It was Gaben. He told me, ""I will save you from this mess under one condition: when you get home from this trip, you will do whatever it takes to obtain a Stat Track M4A1-S Basilisk Battle Scarred in Counter Strike Global Offensive. If you fail to fulfill my request, I will send you back to this place for you to be cooked alive! Do we have a deal?"" I was able to muster out a ""yes,"" and I was immediately transported back in front of the first tree I encountered with the carving ""M4A1-S."" I turned back and went back to my hotel. The day after was my flight back home. And here I am now, telling you this tale.

Relay that to your teammates as well as the callout (location of the enemy) if you can.

1468296331,2016-07-12,"* Done * Alright, so I'll start with T side.. I always buy a Tec-9 first round, if we win I'll go ahead and get a MAC-10 and then upgrade to a P90 or an AK-47 depending on how I'm feeling. On CT side I just start with a USP-S and upgrade to an MP7 or a PP-Bizon depending on the map or which spot I play. I then always get a good old M4A1-S and usually stick with it. I usually buy a Desert Eagle when I run low on money, and when I'm having a bad game I just go with the SG 553 / AUG lol. I very rarely buy AWPs simply because I'm not that great with them and usually there are people on my team that can do much more with one than me! To be honest that's about it! * If you want an actual list, my most frequent buys are: -M4A1-S -AK-47 -Tec-9 -P90 -Desert Eagle -MAC-10 -MP7 -Almost anything else * I'd like the Dual Barettas or the Tec-9! I really hate my current MP7 so I might try out the Anodized Navy as well! * I do and I don't, personally, I have a skin for every weapon I use, but I totally understand someone who does not want to spend money on a Sawed-Off skin, you basically never use that thing, so what's the point? I like seeing all the nice colours in my game so that's why I have a bunch of skins. * a360a * [Trade Link](https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=273117264&amp;token=9OgdQuAS) * I mean, it depends, in my case, almost every skin I have I actually bought with my own money, and my inventory is in no way a big one, but I have a few reds and a few pinks. In my opinion, I'm allowed as much as anyone else to enter low tier giveaways. And then there are some people that are absolutely drowning in skins and knives, I don't exactly understand why they would want a 5 cent skin, but I mean, they can enter if they want! * In my opinion, no. I'll use myself as an example again. I've been saving up with money from drops and giveaways I've gotten for almost a year now to finally get a knife. I love and appreciate every single person that decided to give away something to me or anyone else and I always thank them. But in some cases my current playskin is just more appealing to me then whatever I won, and I'll just simply sell it to fund that knife I've been wanting! So no, nothing wrong with that in my opinion. In some cases though, the gifter will specify that what he's giving away actually has sentimental value to it, then I can understand the frustration of seeing the skin sold in less than a minute! * Thank you so much for this giveaway! I had fun writing this! And I don't think I missed any hidden requirements in your message... if I did, I'm very sorry. :P",0.053,0.801,0.146,0.9927,1
1468299207,2016-07-12,"AK and M4A1-S mainly, I pick the AWP up if no one in the team wants it. On pistol rounds I go for kevlar on t side and on CT i pick a kit and 2 flashes or kevlar if someone bought kit. For rounds with low money I buy a FAMAS or a Swag-7 (depending on map) on CT side and for T side I usually just go for the Tec-9 and full nades. I occasionally buy the Five-SeveN and the XM1014, sometimes when I'm full saving I'll buy just a p250 if I have a good ammount of money. And Ilike to use the Scout when we win pistol on T side at Dust 2 (and only then). Almost forgot! I love either the UMP-45 or the MP7 after we win the pistol, the UMP I sometimes use when I feel like it and I have a low economy. I like basically every skin so I'll just say the three I prefer the most: Galil Stone Cold, Dualies Cobalt Quartz and Glock Wraith.

I remember reading somewhere on the global offensive subreddit that the odds of getting a souvenir dragon lore is about 0.015% (can't find it though, so take that number with a grain of salt).

Far back in February, I requested COD Black Ops 1 on /r/GiftofGames (cool sub you should check them out) and unexpectedly got CSGO and Payday 2 along with it. At first I just ignored CSGO but one day I fired it up because I was curious, and the rest is history. I didn't even play comp for 100 hours and when I did I was quite trash, it took me a LONG time to really actually git gud but now that I'm here I couldn't be more glad that I got CSGO accidentally. I remember when I first realized that ""skins"" were a thing, I saw some guy in casual with an AK elite build and SSG necrophos and thought ""dude those look sooooo cool they must cost like a bajillion dollars"". Before long, I was on the market buying skins for myself, although I was still quite the noob and did buy some idiotic things like a $2 stattrak revolver skin and $5 stattrak dualies skin. I then bet my nice field tested P90 Assimov and field tested Glock Water elemental on lounge, I knew NOTHING whatsoever about pro teams at that point so my friend just told me ""just find matches with like 80% or higher chance and bet, easy cash"". I chose a match that was Team Liquid vs. some random tier 5 CIS team (Winter something), odds 85-15 and ended up losing, which made me swear off CS betting forever (a promise I have kept to this day, probably a good thing). About a month in, I've been building my inventory, have a lot of nice stuff including an AWP Man-o-war, M4A1 Golden Coil, AK Wasteland Rebel (largely thanks to my IRL friend that gave me a Man-o-war ST MW free to help get me started). One of my friends invites me for a comp 5-man, and the bottom fragger (who I didn't know) adds me after the game and says he is interested in buying my whole inventory (about $90 at the time) for one Steam Wallet $100 code. This is where shit went downhill. I checked the guy's profile and checked him on SteamRep, he had a high Steam level, 4yrs on Steam, lots of friends, lots of games, and lots of ""+rep I received the cash"" comments, in addition to a totally clean SR. I felt a bit nervous but traded my entire inventory to him in one go without a second thought about it, after which point he un-added and blocked me. I was pretty depressed after this but did not intend to let my inv go without a fight, so proceeded to look at all the people on the scammer's friend list and comment on their profile ""please help, a user on your friends list has scammed me for everything I own, I need assistance getting in touch with him"". Most ignored and blocked me but one kind guy accepted my friend requested and talked to me for a bit. He said that the guy in question wasn't responding to his messages so I thought ah whatever, typical scammer behavior, and went back to being depressed. Now here is where the true idiot in me kicks in. He asks me to give him a list of the big stuff that I lost in the scam, then says that he can help me fund getting most of it back but I have to chip in too, i.e. send some skins from my inv (I had rebuilt to about $30 at that time). I keep him added and send him a few skins day-by-day, they disappear from his inv but I think ""no big deal he's just selling them"". And on the day that I send the final skin, I go to eat dinner, come back to my computer and what do you know he has blocked me. Crippling depression sets in once more and I wonder if I could have possibly been more stupid in that situation, it was a true case of more-greed-than-sense. Now, fast forward quite a bit to today, I have a somewhat decent inventory (about $20) of small skins and decide to finally fulfill my dream of buying a knife. For about a month I used that knife and I loved it more than anything else in CS, but I wanted to try those magic ""knife to a better knife"" trades. So I put it up on Lounge and wait for offers.....and one guy comments with a Gut Night saying ""add me"". His account looked suspicious as it was lvl 1 and only game was CSGO, plus not much inventory, but I thought ""whatever it's in Steam trade, what can possibly go wrong"". He adds his knife and like 5 other shit skins and cases, and I add my knife and ready up. He then asks me to add a random CSGO background because he needs it for his profile so I think ""whatever"", un-ready and add it, then ready back up and confirm the trade. Then I start CSGO to equip the new knife and it isn't there, so I immediately realize what must have happened and had a brief thought of killing myself because I truly wondered if the losses were ever going to stop. But then, the fucking Hail Mary of Hail Mary's comes through, in the form of /u/ROFLM0NSTER, who sent a completely unsolicited trade for about $50 in free skins which gives me the inventory I have today. All-in-all, it's been quite the bumpy road indeed, and the generosity of the human race as well as the scumbagginess and shittiness of the human race have both amazed me beyond belief. I have finally learned all the lessons that I need to, I believe, and yes I have been quite the idiot but I don't believe it will be happening again (thank god). wait hang on why the fuck did I type all this and how did it get so big all of a sudden",0.102,0.743,0.156,0.9963,1

As a silver that solo-queues often, I don't have much of a position or strategy other than ""rush in a herd"", though when I get an AWP I do tend to like mid on most maps I play. I've taken D2 out of my rotation and I have inferno, cache, mirage and aztec in. The last map gets rotated around between the lesser-played maps, it almost never gets chosen and when it does I enjoy getting something new. Overall, I like CSGO. Some people take it too far, but there are fanatics in most hobbies. I tend to play in short bursts and rotate with other games on occasion so I don't get burnt out. Thank you for your giveaway.

Of all the skins out there, I really like those that have designs embossed or engraved on them. The [Cartel skins](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=319451213) come to mind. They seem really unassuming at first, but on closer inspection, you can notice the details, which changes everything and makes them look all the more better. The skin for the Dual Berettas is my favourite so far (I really hope the Galil AR | Cartel comes out soon!). Then there's the Basilisk for the M4A1-S. I like it for similar reasons. The creator[ has so many other skins](http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=329765394) in a similar style, all of which i love. I don't really know why. These skins can get away with that sort of 'minimalism' because they don't look like skins, but rather a part of the weapon, or the weapon itself. I like the Case-Hardened series for that reason alone. Sometimes, there are different takes on this, like the [Fuel Injector series](http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=636200084) by emu (holy shit, that M249!) and Teo~'s [Royal Series](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=525330888) weapons like the Royal Paladin, Royal Legion, Lead Conduit, and the Aristocrat. Then there a [few](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=740604195) [other](http://polycount.com/discussion/169766/pc-csgo-ne-92a-honorable-mention#latest) skins that i really hope get into the game. There are just so many different skins, it's mind-boggling. People come up with something new all the time. As someone who's looking at a career in art, these skins are a huge inspiration.

1494898346,2017-05-16,"I have won 2 giveaways. The first was a FT AK47 Redline with 4 Titan Stickers (including a Kat 2014) from /u/powahauz. It is still my AK play skin, though I am looking to replace it (will never sell it though, it means too much to me). The second was an ST FT M4A1-S Hyperbeast. It was something /u/danknissan bought instead of gambling and was named NO GAMBLING -raocsgo. I didn't care for the M4 Hyperbeast so I sold it (which I still regret, may have to buy again) to fund my AWP, which I didn't have a skin for at the time. I wanted to keep with Dank's motiff, so I bought a FT AWP Hyperbeast and renamed it NO GAMBLING -raocsgo. However, I am now at the point where I have most of the skins I want that I can afford, so I may sell skins that I win to fund more expensive skins that I want. As for when I host a giveaway, I hope that I am giving someone a skin that they will actually use, and I know for a fact that it has occurred a couple of times, but I also accept that they might sell, the same way I might sell.

He'd come to our office (via bus and walking with his stick, mind you) and sit &amp; chat with me about music &amp; stuff. Because we're busy seeing people, sometimes he'd wait over an hour just to meet up with me. I remember seeing him walk down stairs for the first time, dude CHARGED down them full speed. I guess that's the rhythm he was used to... He told me he could still make out shapes and occasionally make out colors as well, but it was usually just a huge blur. But like I said, he'd bus it to our office, which is surrounded by 2 busy streets, then walk over. It was pretty admirable how fearless he was about it but to him it was a matter of ""How else am I gonna get around?"" Not every attempt was successful as sometimes he'd come in with cuts on his hands or scraped up knees, saying he fell. So, when I could, I'd walk him over to his stop, to make sure he'd make it that way since his stop was back on the lot of a hospital parking lot and finally I just started giving him rides whenever he'd come out this way. Just ask him where he was heading next and then drop him at a business that he knew the parameters for and he'd go on his way. Hell, at one point, he even asked me to set up a Tinder account for him and just swipe for him based on the type of girls he liked. This went on for a bit, but after a while he moved to a new side of town and the visits became less &amp; less. On top of that my work is all about assisting people with training funds for school, so soon he was enrolled and had a case manager taking care of what he needed. However, according to my co-workers he was... a bit of a dick. They caught him in their offices randomly, he'd hit on the female co-workers without every letting up. I mean, I knew he meant well for the most part, but I guess it got aggressive. So I haven't talked with him for about a month or two, so I know this can be considered recent, but all my nice stuff I usually do for family. And to me that's not ""nice,"" that's kinda just what you do. tl;dr - Gave a blind homie rides when I could &amp; helped him to map out different spots around town so that he could then go there on his own.

First, you can never go wrong with the Glock, P2k, USP, AK and M4's, extendable to the Tec-9/5-7/CZ and Deagle. Then, find sick looking, but classic skins in those. Examples: Glock Water Elemental, Dragon Tattoo, P2000 Fire Elemental, Scorpion, USP-S Stainless, Guardian, AK Wasteland Rebel, Redline, M4A4 Desert Strike, Bullet Rain, M4A1-S Cyrex, Guardian, Tec-9 Titanium Bit, Isaac, 5-7 Candy Apple, Copper Galaxy, CZ75-Auto Victoria, The Fuschia is Now, Deagle Conspiracy, Crimson Web. All of these are classics (2015 or older) that look amazing but that have less and less showings in each passing year with the addition of new skins and players. All of these work wonderfully as playskins for ages to come for either being slick or sick. In terms of the knife giveaways, if you want and can do so, go for it.

I was holding B site. Terrorist rushed A and i was in 3v1 situation. I had a awp with me. First kill i got was behind the car. Then i was moving towards the bomb site to defuse the bomb. It was default plant. One terrorist was hiding behind the boxes, I pulled a epic no scope with the Awp, pretty proud moment for me. So now it was 1v1 situation. He was hiding somewhere near long doors. Dunno why he didn't try to shoot while i got this no scope. But then as time was running out, i started defuse. while doing that i saw him running through long. I left defuse and hide behind the boxes. As there was no time i swapped Awp with m4a1-s, rushed on him, killed him. Also managed to defuse the bomb. Team mates were like add me dude you're good.

1616426289,2021-03-22,"First of all adios from one of the best FPS games ever made. So before I go ahead and explain the dream I would like to tell you a little about a small project I satarted a few months ago. I quite like the color blue since I was small, seeing the amazing sky and all. So i started thinking about what If I have a blue themed csgo inventory. So I sit and jot down all the skins along with their cheapest and least scratched look blue coloured skins. Obviously I had to keep the Knife and the gloves out of it as I can't simply afford those outrageously priced skins. The project is almost done except for a few skins here and there. I have listed the one's that are still left. If you don't believe me you can check my csgo inventory here: [https://steamcommunity.com/id/deception07/inventory/#730](https://steamcommunity.com/id/deception07/inventory/#730) The skins left to collect for my blue inventory are: AK, MP7, MP9, Nova, P90, Mac 10, Famas, &amp; the M4a1s. The process of making profit out of money I have already put in steam is quite a long one. Don't know if I'm doing it wrong or what, but it will probably take a few more months to get there. Now for the dream. Last nights dream was quite a nostalgic one. So I turn into one of the transformer like robots and save the city. The nostalgic part is that it's from a TV series I had watched when I was little called ""Super human Samurai"" Where the heroes travel into a cyber city through wires and it was insane. So for once I get to be the driver of this huge beastly machine. I play csgo mostly on weekends thanks to the job that keeps me busy all week. You can check my hours on my steam profile below. This was one hell of a essay, sorry but I got carried away sharing things. Thanks once again for doing this.
