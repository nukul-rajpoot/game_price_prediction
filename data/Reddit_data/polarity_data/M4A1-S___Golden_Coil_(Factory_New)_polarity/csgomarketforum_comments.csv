Please excuse me if my dates are out by a day, I'm in Australia so market graphs adjust for my timezone. The [M4 Cyrex](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/M4A1-S%20|%20Cyrex%20%28Factory%20New%29) is going the craziest at the moment. What happened is when Valve dropped the [Breakout Pass](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Operation%20Breakout%20All%20Access%20Pass) price to $1 on Sept 11th, tons of new people bought it and started playing and got Breakout Case drops. If you look at the market availability for the [Breakout Case](http://steamcompanion.com/csgo/Operation-Breakout-Weapon-Case/), it surges right after the 11th and again a week later after the 18th, and building up again now. The personal weekly drop reset is fairly synchronised right now for this large group of people. We can see similar patterns when Breakout was new and case availability increased in roughly weekly waves (June 2nd, 9th, 17th, 24th, 31st, then fading as synchronisation dissipated). So that's what the M4 Cyrex is doing, and it'll probably only get worse. Much worse, if the Breakout Case goes public in a few days like the Phoenix Case did. If you have one, sell sell sell. It's hitting [other items](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Desert%20Eagle%20|%20Conspiracy%20%28Factory%20New%29) in the collection too. Next we have the ongoing price decline in items such as the [AWP Corticera](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AWP%20|%20Corticera%20%28Field-Tested%29) and [M4 Bullet Rain](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/M4A4%20|%20Bullet%20Rain%20%28Field-Tested%29). This is the natural decline of new items from the latest case (eSports 2014 Summer). It's to be expected. They'll drop further over time and take a real hit when the next collection is released. Next is the price decline from Sept 3rd, caused by the P250 buy-up and triggering widespread panic selling. Obviously the big ""investment"" skins like the [Glock Fade](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Glock-18%20|%20Fade%20%28Factory%20New%29) and [Fire Serpent](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AK-47%20|%20Fire%20Serpent%20%28Field-Tested%29) were hit the hardest, but others such as the [AK Redline](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AK-47%20|%20Redline%20%28Field-Tested%29) and [Glock-18 Candy Apple](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Glock-18%20|%20Candy%20Apple%20%28Field-Tested%29) have shown a steadier decline since then.

Next tournament is at the end of November. * New skins suffer the biggest price drop when the following collection is released, and again with the collection after that. * Valve-made skins from cases and operations historically last 10-20 weeks, then cease and begin rising in price (although recently they brought back some old ones, so don't put all your eggs in one basket). * Community workshop skins historically last 40+ weeks, then cease and begin rising in price. * eSports cases last for about 4 months to fund major tournaments, then cease and begin rising in price. * The most popular skins are for the AWP, AK-47, M4A4, M4A1-S, Glock-18. * The next most popular skins are for the USP-S, P2000, P250, Desert Eagle, and P90. * Never open cases. * Invest in consumables like cases and stickers, they have the highest % return. * Check steamcompanion.com to look at supply histories. Steadily diminishing supply usually means an item has ceased dropping in the game. * Don't panic sell. Chances are other people are too and you're not getting a good price. Prices often bounce back from downward spikes. * Don't buy into market manipulation. It benefits those who get in first and burns the people who follow. * Don't sell using the Steam client. It has a bug that can list the wrong item, which is why there are so many 4c knives on the sale graphs. Use a browser instead. * When there's a price change, look for the reason. See if it's affecting other skins or other collections, see if there's been a change to the game that could have caused it. * Do it because you enjoy it. Play the actual game, use your skins.

1437614340,2015-07-23,"&gt;betting and gambling never works out in my favor That's kind of the idea. Here's my basic understanding. **Case investing:** Buy cases &amp; sticker capsules when they are at 3c/4c. They can't get any cheaper and once they stop dropping they are sure to rise in price (Be aware of the volume on the market - cases with close to a million currently on the market will take a long time to rise in price.) Popularity of the skins in the cases has an influence. i.e. Vanguard cases are still cheap and will rise in price slowly as the skins aren't as desirable, despite the supply stopping. Huntsman cases are much more desirable and quickly rose in price once they stopped dropping. Sticker Capsules are good investments as once a sticker is used on a skin, it's gone from the market for good. Gun Skins from cases only leave the market if a user is banned. Supply for stickers should always drop. **Tournament Sticker Investing:** Buy stickers at a low price (during the sale towards the end of a tournament is best) and sit on them. You can either sell shortly after the tournament for a quick profit, or wait 6 months+ for a larger profit. If you buy during the sale then you're basically guaranteed profit. If you're lucky a team will be banned or split or become successful in the future which is likely to drive up the price of their stickers (see ibuypower). The amount of profit from these stickers depends on how nice they look. Katowice stickers look great, dreamhack not so much, 2014 cologne even less so. **Skin Investing:** Trickier than the other two and more risk involved. I wouldn't really recommend as it's unlikely to be more profitable unless you really know what you're doing. A couple of methods: * Contraband skins - if a skin goes contraband for whatever reason the price will shoot up. Buy early when this happens and you should see profit if you wait. Don't expect it to really happen again... Valve will likely not let any copywright infringing skins through after the Howl. * Skins no longer dropping - skins from a case that has stopped dropping or from a collection from an operation that has stopped will rise. How much so will depend on their desirability. This will be a slow process. (example: M4A1-S Guardian) * Operation fluctuations - With the new ""1 drop per week"" for the operation we're seeing big fluctuations in some skins on the market . As the drop resets everyone levels up then most sell their skins more or less immediately. This massive influx drives the prices down. As the supply of skins slows throughout the week the price climbs back up, usually peaking just before the drop resets. If you play this right you can make a bit of profit by buying and selling on the market at the correct times for the correct prices. This can be a gamble as there's not really much certainty on the price. My advice here: research the skins and their trends. Skins that can be used in tradeups to highly desirable skins are the best, but it's hard to judge what will happen and what the price peak will be. If you do this, make sure you're happy with any profit and don't get too greedy. (example: Skins that tradeup to M4A1-S Icarus Fell) * Random fluctuations - Keep an eye on mid price skins that there isn't a huge volume of (see Deagle Blaze) and if you manage to pick one up at a low price and sell at a peak price then you can net a few bucks profit. Do your research and hope you get lucky. **Sticker Investing:** Maybe someone more experienced can chime in. But from what I can see: * You could buy stickers when you get a sticker offer then sell on market. Check the prices and be aware of the market tax. You might net a few extra cents pretty quickly but you're really not getting much profit here. * Buy up on stickers when the capsules have stopped dropping / they are no longer offered as deals - My guess is the capsules themselves would be better investments and I don't think there's really any way to know if a sticker is no longer offered as deals other than their recent trending. **Knife Investing:** More or less don't. Knives are fickle things to trend. Maybe you find a knife with a nice pattern going cheap due to an oblivious seller. But it won't be easy to get rid of. As with the skins knives from cases that are no longer dropping should rise in price, knives from current cases (i.e. Falchion) will drop in price until the case stops dropping. **Operation Passes:** You can buy passes then sell after the operation has finished. If you want to do this buy during the sale and wait 4-6 months. You should see profit, but I personally wouldn't bother. Vanguard sold well as it didn't reach as low a discount as people were expecting and wasn't on sale long, so not many were bought. **Souvenir Cases:** Research the different cases and their skins. Cases like the Cobblestone case is the most desirable due to the Dragon Lore. During the tournament the supply will be at it's height so buy early and wait. Profit will continue to climb but might be a slow process depending on the case you have and the volume that were dropped.",0.068,0.833,0.099,0.9916,23

Don't forget Valve bases their decision on data taken from their actual user-base, not just what is seen in majors, in the hands of pros. Honestly, there's a lot more things that are in much more need of buffing. Valve has stated that, to them, a balanced weapon selection means all weapons have their uses, and no weapons are never used. Here's a list of stuff that is never used: Berettas, the scoped rifles in both teams, the XM shotgun, MGs, Zeus, UMP-45. If you ask me, if they really mean what they said about weapon use, those areas are in dire need of serious intervention. Also, they can buff the M4A4 all they want, they will never make it as accurate as the M4A1-S as it would defeat the purpose, which is why the people who love the M4A1-S will never stop using it.

Chroma has 3 of these, Breakout only has 1, and Breakout's is an M4A1-S which has been nerfed recently. So I'd argue Chroma has better contents. Both have non-standard knives, but I'm not convinced people open old cases for them. Huntsman knives didn't change in value after the Huntsman Case was discontinued. I don't think Breakout's Butterfly Knife from 2014 is a draw card anymore. If people ignore Chroma's knives because they can get them from Chroma 2, I don't think that's any worse than the disinterest people will have for Butterfly Knives. Chroma 1 is due to rise sharply within a month or so. Stocks have dropped by 72% over the last four months, and a 12% further drop should double its price. It hasn't been a steady reduction in supply, but sale prices have crept up from 3c-4c in December to 3c-5c in January. Once people are queuing to buy at 5c-6c, the hype train will take over and push it up to 8c-11c, probably spiking even higher. There are only 28,000 at 9c - that's less than a day's worth of sales. Vanguard went through the same thing in September, four months after it was discontinued. Huntsman did it in May, one month after it was discontinued. They all do it at some point and Chroma is next.

So the pink skins and the knives are good here. (and maybe the man o war) Lets take a look on Chroma 2: **AK-47 | Elite Build** MP7 | Armor Core Desert Eagle | Bronze Deco P250 | Valence Negev | Man-o'-war Sawed-Off | Origami **AWP | Worm God** MAG-7 | Heat CZ75-Auto | Pole Position UMP-45 | Grand Prix **Five-SeveN | Monkey Business** **Galil AR | Eco** **FAMAS | Djinn** M4A1-S | Hyper Beast** MAC-10 | Neon Rider **or an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!** Here you can see that there is a often used cheap but goodlooking blue skin.

You can't get a M9 Bayonet, Karambit or Bayonet out of this case and you can't get those popular Chroma finishes, which you can sell for hundreds of dollars, so Chroma-Cases will always have a big advantage, when it comes to knife unboxing. Btw. I'd argue that the Phoenix Case is a good investment in long term. There are some cases that are openend more than others. For example you can check the Huntsman Case rise after the 24th December and the equal rise of the supply of it's blue skins (indicator for cases openend and not only invested in).

Regarding the market, I think people are panic buying (as is the case with the other stickers) right now and it will sink quickly. **However,** I do not believe we have a Kinguin case on our hands. For one, even though Splyce is similar to Kinguin in that they will most likely never attend another major again, the Splyce stickers are arguably FAR better looking than the Kinguin stickers. The Dorito stickers from Cologne 2015 are BEYOND ugly, and this was an incredibly popular opinion when they were first released. To my knowledge, only a handful of people actually liked those stickers. Plus, the color scheme of the Kinguin stickers and the actual logo itself are pretty bad looking on most, if not, all skins (again, just my opinion). **TL;DR:** I think a majority of people would say the Splyce Foil is good looking.

Wait until the operation hits, then go for Kato15 foils or Kato14 regulars. They've always been popular and are at a seasonal low. Try to favour teams that are still around, since defunct teams have less potential for future hype. Grab a few old operation passes. The Bloodhound Coin has been updated for the Chinese version, so it's definitely going to be visible to them. If they end up with market access the price of old passes could skyrocket. But hold off from buying cases until we know what Valve is going to do with them. Put in some buy orders for the last of the in-game sticker offers (Drug War Vet, Kawaii Killer, etc). I think we're seeing the tail end of availability, and the price will double overnight once they get discontinued. There are a couple of other investments you can try if you want to do something slightly more risky. I personally don't plan on doing these, but they're options you can look at: There's a suspicion that Valve will do team/player grafittis for the next major instead of stickers. The major is mid Feb, so if there is grafitti we'll know around late Jan. Old team stickers could get a boost from this, just as they're coming off the post-Christmas boost. So it might be worth looking for the cheapest team stickers you can find before it all starts. Be sure to weigh up the sticker appearance, market supply, and if they're competing in Las Vegas. The Cobblestone/Overpass/Cache skins have been around for the last 4 operations, and Gods&amp;Monsters/RisingSun/ChopShop has been around for the last 2. There's a possibility we'll see something new this operation, perhaps with themes that appeal to the Chinese market. If they replace any of the old collections, there could be a price spike. If you have steam wallet ready, and you're watching the market and operation blog, there's an opportunity to grab something fast and flip it for a quick profit. The M4A1-S Knight would be my primary pick, but there are definitely others. The perfect outcome would be flipping for profit while you're still inside the 48 hour new operation window, so you can reinvest in consumables while they're cheap. As always, diversify!

1568526567,2019-09-15,"I can confirm that investing in tradeup food could potentially lead to some ""quick"" profits, provided you buy the right items from the right collections, as _-_aaaabv said in his comment. The key is buying them for the right price, and relisting them for a price you are comfortable with and think people are still willing to pay when it comes to them trading up. This can be achieved by pulling them off of trade bots, or using steam market buy orders / purchasing them outright. The last thing you want is to buy up all your ""food"" and relist it for a bad price, only to miss the hype when its at its peak. Despite this inherent risk, the process of trading up for the new skins within the newest case continues long after the original spike, and this can help you make some ""safer"" profit. You are able to see where the food has stabilised, or you can even make the decision to do your own tradeups if you feel the risk is worth it. I have personally gone for mil spec skins form the Italy collection exclusively, for the following reasons: Firstly they have a very forgiving float range, with the two conditions for my chosen skin (the MP7 Anodized Navy in FN) being FN and MW. The price is also appealing, while they are not the cheapest mil spec blue out there, they possess the best possible float range (0-0.08) meaning minimal wear skins are very uncommon, with the large majority of mp7s being in FN. Secondly the outcome isnt ""that"" bad. Some other collections, notable the Train and Lake collection, which also possess single purple outcomes from a blue to purple tradeup, have very bad purple grade skins. The dualies anodized navy and tec 9 red quartz are shockingly cheap, and the even though their blue inputs are cheaper, their lower price doesnt justify a potentially larger loss when you fail a tradeup. The AWP pit viper, while still cheap, is liquid enough to move fast once you fail a tradeup. Other outcomes such as the FN m4a1s nitro (which would be harder to obtain since you are trading up with FT / MW blues from the CS20 case anyways) or the AK emerald pinstripe provide higher returns at the cost of higher inputs. What turns me away from the Bank and DustII collection blues is that the are harder to find in low float, with the exception of the SG553 Damascus, but this is off the cards due to the SG being in the meta and is pricer as a result. Same goes for the SG553 Anodized. Apologies for the wall of text, TLDR is that you want to buy your tradeup food for as cheap as possible, but not get greedy when it comes to relisting them, as many other people (myself included) have had this same idea in the works for a long time. Listing your skins in chunks that are priced differently is also a possible strategy (by float or just by number, eg lower floats cost more, of 10 skins cost xyz, while the next 10 cost xyz +10%).

For example the shattered web case wasn't in rare drop pool pre fracture case update. Can't say if that changed with the update. &gt;But reaction of the market is kinda weak. Why would you expect an immediate strong market reaction? The prices were rising a bit because of people investing after learning the gamma case went rare. That is in general a good idea, but for the longterm. It will rise in the longterm when supply gets less. Don't expect any skyrocketing in the next weeks or months. Look at the chroma 2 case. It is in the rare drop pool for some time. It didn't skyrocket because there is enough supply left, but it has still a tendence of rising. The really slow rise will continue and when we hit a point with lower supply it will rise quicker. This still takes time.

For more data look at this: https://pricestalker.eu/d/IvhU5IQWp/cs-go-cases?orgId=1&amp;from=now-90d&amp;to=now You can see that the chroma 2 case has less and less listings in the last 90 days, means the supply is slowly going down. Now look at the gamma case. It has some fluctuations, but the supply on the market looks more or less steady.

Wait at least a year or longer. Don't even think about selling before the first spike or when the case is skyrocketing. You can assume that there are many millions of gamma cases in inventories. A lot because of investing and a lot of normal players that simply just play and sell stuff randomly at some point. The demand will slowly go down and not stay always at 30k. &gt;Or Gamma Case is just bad? The case is great. It has gamma knives, which only drop in gamma and gamma 2. It has decent skins like M4A1-S | Mecha Industries, Glock Wasteland Rebel, M4 Desolate Space, AWP Phobos,... If there won't be a gamma 3 case, with the gamma knives, it is an even greater case.

You can decide to sell the item now and buy it again at a lower price a few weeks later, or hold onto it and sell it during a hype. The control collection, which the m4a1-s blue phosphor is from, is really popular because it has a chance of getting the awp fade. Also, we can expect that the skins from the operation broken fang will rise after it ends, but not as much as shattered web due to the availability of the items (In order to get shattered web items, one would have to buy the case and a key, but getting an operation broken fang item only requires you to buy the pass). Because of this, we can only use operation shattered web as a very rough estimate of what will happen with operation broken fang. What I was trying to say is that we are only in the first week of the operation, so in order to get a good item such as the blue phosphor, one would have to be very lucky or spend money to get stars since a non-paying player can only get at most 10 stars per week. As time progresses, more people will get stars due to more missions being released, so the price of the item will drop when more are unboxed. Then, right before the operation ends, we can also expect the prices to go up due to hype. In the very long run, however, as long as valve doesn't re-introduce the skin, you should make profit.

1610130589,2021-01-08,"Great post, thanks for sharing your thoughts! My Opinion is quite the same as yours, but to go a little bit into detail: 1. Obviously the Control Collection is the most hyped collection, first of all because of the AWP Fade. 2. The fact, that it is oversupplied is true, just compare any skin from the control collection with one of the ancient / havoc collection (same weapon class of course) on csgofloat.db and compare the numbers. 3. This oversupply thus lead to the lower prices, especially if you compare Restricted, MI-Specs and Industrial Grades. 4. But how will this be in the future? I think you will not make great stonks if you invest into the fade, but on the other hand trade-ups will continue. Given the fact that IF it won´t be reintroduced (which I think, because Valve realised that they make more stonks, if they bring new skins every operation), prices will rise. Youtubers won´t stop trading up to the AWP Fade. 5. Another thing you might consider is the structure of the new operations compared to the last one´s (St. Marc, Canals, Norse). We know have to pinks. But doesn´t that mean, that the Purples will even more rise in prise, given the fact that you chances are better to get a pink? I think yes. 6. If you compare the three collections to each other, I personally find the ancient collections the most interesting one. Why: The M4A1-S Welcome to the Jungle and the AK47 Panthera Onca are simply one of the most beautiful new skins! A lot of people also like the Mac-10 Gold Brick and the AUG Curved Jade. I definetely see a potenital rise in price over time here, because in almost every category (Blue,Purple,Pink,Red) you have one skin which is worth to trade up for. 7. Another think you might give a thought is the comparison between M4A4 and M4A1-S. RIGHT know people are playing more M4A4, but isn´t it a little bit interesting, on which skins valve is focussing since the Operation Broken Fang Collection? They Released 4 new Collections, and which M4A4 and M4A1-S skins did they introduce? **Broken Fang Case:** \--&gt; M4A4 Cyber Security: A good-looking **Pink** Skin tbh \--&gt; M4A1-S Printstream: A good-looking **RED** Skin **Control Collection**: \--&gt; M4A4 Global Offensive: Not my favorite **BLUE** Skin, but it seems that most people like it \--&gt; M4A1-S Blue Phosphor: An AMAZING **Pink** Skin in my opinion. **Havoc Collection**: **NONE** M4A4 / M4A1-S **Ancient Collection**: \--&gt; M4A1-S Welcome to the jungle: In my opinion maybe the best, but at least one of the best skins of the M4A1-S Skins, and it is a **RED** So, we have 2 new M4A4 Skins, one Blue and one good-looking pink, but we have 2 new Reds and one more pink M4A1-S skins, which are all looking great in my opinion. Some of us know, what last time happened, when the M4A1-S got nerved a long time ago and maybe - OF COURSE THIS IS HIGHLY SPECULATIVE - they want to give the M4A1-S to become a good alternative for Players and they will nerve it again.

Valve does want other rifles to be niche pick ups such as AUG, SG553 and M4A1s. And inevitably, these niche weapons either get nerfed too much that nobody use them in majors, or getting buffed too much that they get used even more than AK-47 and M4A4. When they are over-buffed the nerfs are bound to happen. Additioally, it is hard to predict when valve buff those niche weapons.

All ""invest"" (dumb) their stars into the control collection to get the AWP Fade, so 3/4 of all stars are being spend into one collection. Given the fact, that the other collections have a better ROI, this simply don´t make sense from an economic perspective. On the other side we could potentially see a huge rise in those items, because the demand is obviously there.Imo all 3 collections have their pros and cons and we´ll see how this will work out in the future.

Consumer skins do go up but very slowly Industrial: The R8 Phoenix Marker is an alright looking skin and could have passed as a mil-spec skin imo. Industrial skins tend to be easy, low-risk fun trade-ups that will lead to these at least doubling in price once the operation ends. Mil-Spec: There are a lot of nice skins, the Tiger Pit P90, the Desert Eagle Mind Heist and the float-capped P250 Bengal Tiger should see some nice gains, esp. the FN Bengal Tiger. Restricted: The Phoenix Blacklight is nice but the other two seem forgettable. Classified: The Silk Tiger is a sleeper hit waiting to happen. Once the operation ends, I wouldn't be surprised to see this rise like the M4A1-S Knight did. The MAC-10 Hot Snakes is alright but who really brags about having a $300 MAC-10 skin? The Hot Snakes will probably just be seen as the trade-up filler for the AK-47 X-Ray. Covert: The X-Ray has mixed reviews and I can see why.

1615978442,2021-03-17,There are a couple obvious reasons why the price is quite high in the first place and some why it's rising right now too. It is a very rare skin. People where spamming the control collection for the awp fade so there are less skins of the ancient and havoc collection. Even tho it's not the prettiest of all skins it's still an AK skin which are always higher priced compared to other weapons. If it was a gallil it would be a lot lower. We're quite sure it's going to be discontinued in a couple weeks. People have been investing in operation items the last two weeks because they are getting nervous about the sale. Pretty much every item from the collection went up. Even tho the run and hide is more likely to be used as trade up skin for the welcome to the jungle you can still use the panther onca for the trade up. And yes it's a trade up to a M4A1-S which is not very well liked in the community but its still a red operation skin and a very well designed one too. Possibly the best looking M4A1-S skin out there which is right now kinda undervalued in my opinion. Especially since the ancient collection isn't being opened that much. If there is going to be a sale and it drops in price I will probably buy 2 or 3 of it and hope for the best.

1618194218,2021-04-12,"Hard to say, but here are my opinions on each of the collections in order of which I think will return the most value for investment: 1. Control Collection 1. The Covert is an AWP skin, and it's a Fade which already holds a lot of value across the knives/glock. I don't think this AWP skin will hold up to the Gungnir or the Prince of the previous operations Norse and Canals collections, but will still be desirable, and will garner YT trade-ups and the like. 2. M4A1-S Blue Phosphor, though not a meta gun, still a very nice skin, comparable in aesthetic to the Hot Rod, will hold value as a play skin or trade-up skin. 3. USP-S Target Acquired as the secondary pink, not the prettiest skin in the game, but is a starter (spawn) pistol, and could be used for trade-up too. 2. Havoc Collection 1. The Covert is an AK skin. Historically speaking, the XRAY line is not a ""major"" hit, but it is still an AK. I personally love the XRAY line, but a lot of people hold it in poor regard given the eSports 2013 Winter Case case the M4A4 comes from and it being the only covert in there. 2. One Classified is an AWP, people love AWP skins. This alone will hold value. The other Classified being a MAC-10, not a bad skin, already expensive, popular in eco rounds. Holds value as a play skin and trade-up skin. 3. I personally think the Restricted Galil Phoenix Black light and the Mil-Spec Desert Eagle Night Heist are great play-skins and trade-up skins. 4. One of the less hyped collections coming out of the operation release, my guess is less stars used within here, lower supply for future sale. 3. Ancient Collection 1. The Covert is an M4A1-S skin, which is not currently ""meta"". There are a myriad of great M4A1-S skins, more than I think for the M4A4 which is the current preferred, so players can look elsewhere for a good M4A1-S skin if they desire, especially if they aren't even M4A1-S users. 2. One Classified is AK, a Jaguar variant skin if you will. AKs always hold value due to the nature of the guns popularity in-game. Though not the most stunning AK, it does have it's fans (myself included). Secondary Classified operates purely as a trade-up skin in my opinion, I do not think the skin is great, and the P90 isn't really a play gun for non-casual players. 3. AUG Carved Jade is my sleeper skin for all these collections. It's value may always be dependent on the collections success, but aside from that I think it's a clean skin with potential, especially if the AUG see's an resurgence in usage. If not, still a serviceable trade-up gun That all being said, not advice, not and advisor.

1622460965,2021-05-31,"I do think Control Collection has a lot of potential. Everything is rising just as fast, even the consumers despite having a much larger supply. Control collection overall has very good skins, especially from Mil-Spec and upwards, probably the best overall looking skins from blue's to reds. Also control collection has a lot of capped skins like Blue Phosphor ( very good tradeup tool to BF pinks in good floats ), Berries and Cherries, Mag-7 Carbon Fiber and so on. That means that those are prime materials to be used in tradeups since they allow you to get lower float items for relatively cheap compared to the Ancient/Havoc counterparts where SG-Hypnotic ( also capped ) is 2X as expensive. A lot of Control skins are amazing playskins ( 5-7, UMP, M4A1-S, USP-S, cheap M4A4, great Scout and P2000 ). So you can diversify your investments way more since all of those skins are much cheaper than their Havoc/Ancient counterparts. Lastly i do think that despite Welcome to the Jungle being super rare, it's not an awp so the demand for it won't be as high down the line, whereas everybody loves fade skins, especially awps/knives. My suggestion is to stack up on as many low float capped skins that i mentioned above: \- Mag-7 Carbon Fibers \- Berries and Cherries \- M4A1-S Blue Phosphor. \- MP9 Army Sheens The 0.00X float skins are very, very desirable in the long term so if you see any of them in low float, pick them up as much as you can, the overpay for them in the future will be massive and the demand will always be there.",0.042,0.834,0.123,0.9801,3

So after my calculations the industrial prices should rise up by 100-200% more than the consumer ones. Also, I feel like the consumer ones are overrated rn, if you would buy in the beginning of the operation, the profit of course would've be HUGE and in that case the consumer grades are a no brainer. 2. Hmm, good question. Let's check the differences between the two first : First of all, the total stock of the BF collections is \~1 million skins more than the SW collections stock. (That's like a \~10% increase). Secondly, the last operation was different cauz we had the option to choose which collection we gonna get skins from. Because of that, the Control collection got opened up massively (=\~60% of the total number of the BF collections stock) which will result in a big disparity in prices among the BF collections. Thirdly, the covert skins aren't really ""great"". The M4A1-S isn't used a lot, and the AK-47 X-Ray didn't hype ppl too much. The AWP Fade (imo) is worse than the Gungnir or the Prince, and also there's just too many skins in that collection. In conclusion, the prices among the 3 collections aren't gonna follow the same path the SW ones took, and they might not reach the same peak in price, but they still have a lot of potential to grow up in price from this moment.",0.018,0.936,0.046,0.6161,1

1633399331,2021-10-05,"All 3 collections that came out of Broken Fang has severe investment limitations. 1. The AK was using an old finish of a its CT counterpart, which has proven to be one of the skins that literally nobody wants. Simply basing it off that has me put off from investing in Havoc collection, because I just think eventually better looking AK skins would come out in the future. 2. Ancient collection comes out with the M4a1-s instead of M4A4. They came out with the lesser used counterpart, which has not been around in pro scene for about 3 years, instead of the more standard used one. Thing about M4A4 and M4A1-s, is they are interchangeable. For M4A1-s to do well in the market, either a nerf on M4A4, or a buff on M4A1-s. For a gun unloved by Valve for so long, we never knew when was the next change coming for it. And as an investor, you gotta hedge instead of gamble, but to successfully invest in M4A1-s would mean you took a 50/50 chance coinflip between M4A4 and M4A1-s. This isn't something I would touch, and there are lesser risk investments out there. 3. They used a highly coveted old finish and slam it on an AWP, which is the best looking out of 3 of them, but even then, it was a bit underwhelming. Think about it, AWP Fade could not hold even a candle to the AWP of its previous operation. When Broken Fang was announced, I was rightly underwhelmed, and I never liked Fade much unless on specific knife finishes. Nevertheless, people based AWP Fade price off Operation Shattered Web prices and build up a bubble economy, with each investor holding 1 or 2, expecting the demand to go up towards the end of operation. However, the demand for it was largely overestimated, and people simply weren't willing to pay that much for it. When people holding AWP Fades realised that, there was a panic selling moment which caused the massive decrease in Broken Fang collection prices and now, the biggest losers are the ones still clinging on to their AWP Fades, thinking the price will increase back to before, when each collection that comes out hurts its value even more. I have never bought a single item from Operation Broken Fang, but it might do well. My friend is looking to ask me to get an AWP Fade for him after the Major is announced as he thinks price will be at an all time low. I will observe Broken Fang collection prices but in the meantime, I still think its trash for the lack of investment opportunities.",0.127,0.803,0.07,-0.9801,2

Some of you might laugh know because (of course) especially the Covert AWP´s here are completely different in terms of their iconic value, but I refer more to it in terms of the charts: The M4A$ Poseidon was also in a long accumulation phase of a couple of years, it was introduced in 2015, was avaiable for 3 times and then discontinued in 2017. But it really starts to move in 2019 and imo it makes sense that the M4A1s Phosphor moves similarly, although it is likely you won´t make the same ROI. People threw their stars like crazy into this collection, but on the other hand it is (likely) discontinued and it has a ton of good trade-up-items (especially at those prices now). So, let´s wait 2 years and see, because the item looks good, the M4A1-S is used more often know (look PGL Major) and it is - related to other operation pink items - cheap in FN which makes it interesting for trade-ups. The real problem about the control collection is that we don´t know how the AWP Fade will behave in the future. Although a lot of people do not like it, the Glock Fade was also not THAT iconic at it is know a few years before. Maybe nobody talks about the AWP Fade in 3 years from know, maybe it will become scarce. There are about 10.000 in trackable inventories, so about 3 times more than for a gungnir oder wild lotus.

This means that whatever the average value of the skins in your upgrade contract is will be compressed to this range. For example you use all battle scared skins with a 0.50 float. The resulting contract if it actually hits the M4A1-s knight would be a factory new knight with a float value of 0.05. 10% of the value of the average of the skins in the upgrade contract. Edit. In fact the only way you could get a minimum wear knight is to not use skins from 100% cobblestone collection. Since the only two skins directly below the knight are the chalice and the hand cannon. The hand cannon has a capped float between 1% and 70% and the chalice has a capped float of 8%.

We know play skins generally don't go up in price very quickly, that should apply to M4A1s from this point on even if it is printstream and even if M4A1s continue to dominate in the next few years. There is no hurt in selling now and invest into more profitable cs go items. We don't know for sure how the price of play skins will go in the next 3/4 months. It is quite likely the compounded effect of Antwerp sticker sale, dota 2 TI battle pass release and steam summer sale will make play skins dip up to 10% in price. Maybe the price will recover and rise a bit after steam summer sale and crash at the start of the next operation, but that is not guaranteed. This year, we already saw relatively large increases in normal play skin prices such as covert/classified AK, M4A1, AWP between Feb to April. Maybe the prices are less likely to be higher in August this year. As for buying M4A4. Well you haven't seen how cheap M4A4 skins were before the M4A4 buff. What if valve actually plan to let M4A1 dominate for a few years. Then I expect M4A4 skins to drop much further in price. We haven't even seen most M4A4 drop 50% in price compared with the peak.

None of them we can say for sure will be profitable and certainly won't be hugely profitable even if they turn out to be profitable before the next operation.

If I be honest with myself, the Havoc is at least one of the worse collections of the operation collections.

IMO, if I have to choose between spending my money into the X-Ray or the Gold Arabesque, I would choose the latter or paying a lot more to get the AK Wild Lilly. It is not a horrible skin, but it is at well not a very iconic skin and should not be a covert operation weapon. And I think after the investment hype was over, this may be a reason why the ancient collection performed better ( yes I know the buff on M4A1-S was also a reason) : the Havoc Collection is not a very iconic collection and especially has not a very iconic covert weapon. On the other hand people will do trade-ups with this collection and maybe there will be another hype in the future, we don´t know. To sum it up: It is not a very desirable weapon, but it is still a rare, discontinued operation item.

What on hindsight was 10X within a year from last operation sticker were some of the surf shop holos. They didn't have much liquidity then or now. For any given surf shop holos it was difficult or impossible to sink thousands of dollars in any of those individual holos at within 15% of the lowest price. And it is hard today to liquidate them within months if you did get hundreds of each. Besides, that was last year, spectrum 2, gamma 2 went 4 times from then to July 2022, chroma 3, prisma 2 went 6/7 times meanwhile and those would be bulk/large opportunities in my definition. But if you ask me to point out 1 case that will be 4 times in 2 years. I cannot give you an answer. And it has been widely said that future major stickers will probably all perform above RMR 2020 but below stockholm 2021. We might not get a mouz holo stockholm or challenger team capsule stockholm for quite some time. It is possible the OP was attracted by those returns seen in the past 2/3 years. But today's market is different. We will see crazy short term 2 times to 5 times spikes for sure in future. But either you cannot predict which item or you cannot predict when or both. Players will retire/get benched/peform. Teams will disband/win big tournament/fail to make to a major. Those will be niche in my defiinition because they have limited liquidity, and you might be holding for months/years if you try to plan for those. It is similar with weapon balance. How do you know to just get in on time for a weapon buff. It is not niche but could you know how to get in just a month or two before a weapon buff.

1671640255,2022-12-21,"I can shed some light on this. It is possible to calculate and know ahead what the wear of a trade-up skin will be by using the below formula: Wear on received item = (MAX\_FLOAT - MIN\_FLOAT) \* (Sum(All 10 trade up skins) / 10) + MIN\_FLOAT Where MAX\_FLOAT and MIN\_FLOAT are the max and minimum float values of the desired trade-up skin. So for example, say I wanted to trade up to a 0.25000000000 M4A1-S Nitro, which is the only restricted in it's collection so I have a 100% chance of hitting it if I use only Safehouse Mil-Specs to trade up to it. The formula as follows: 0.25 = (0.80 - 0.06) \* (Sum(All 10 trade up skins)/10) + 0.06 (0.25 - 0.06) = (0.80 - 0.06) \* (Sum(All 10 trade up skins)/10) (((0.19)/(0.80 - .06)) \* 10) = Sum(All 10 trade up skins) 2.56756756757 = Sum(All 10 trade up skins) Or an average of 0.256756756757 float per Mil-Spec skin. The goal from here is find 10 Safehouse Mil-Specs whose float sum up to 2.56756756757. This is where the more time consuming piece comes in. There is a website that you can use to run this for you (video on it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNgUwxMQPJs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNgUwxMQPJs)).

At Broken Fang times, everyone was talking about the AWP Fade on Youtube and although imo the M4A1-S Welcome To the jungle was the best of the 3 Operation Broken Fang Collection Coverts, everyone mass-opened the control collection with their stars. This also shows me: There was a time where everyone loved the control collection, and maybe this love will come back in a few years. Positive to mention is that is is fully discontinued and has no Souvenir Case. Some of the skins are very good looking (I like the AWP Fade, especially the Blue Phosphor and the Five Seven Berries and Cherries. Negative to mention is the oversupply and the low demand right know. It seems that no one - beside the M4A1-S Phosphor - cares about the Control collection. Personally I think that it could develop like the Chop Shop collection: For years there is no real movement, but people trade-up and when 1. There is another Skins Hype (right know I would say that we have more a sticker and case investment hype) or 2. The collection really will become more rare or 3. The AWP Fade has another hype or anything like that and suddenly it spikes and breaks out. But this could take years. I personally would consider the fact that right know we have a real hype in CS:GO and everything is rising. It doesn´t mean that it could go on for month, but in the past you had many opportunities to go big into the control collection: I personally bought a lot of blue skins below 2 Euro and most of the light blue skins below 0,35€. The last drop was in Summer 2022, where you could easily catch some light blues below 0.45€ again. Why invest all and go ""big"" now?

My friend was really pushing me to get into RMR 2020 golds... Luckily I was a bit late to the party and seeing how much my friend bought his for I could not justify paying so much more for stickers... Especially since I'm not a big fan of stickers. Most skins with stickers look terrible in my opinion... Why buy a nice looking skin and then put stickers all over it? Ugly 99% of the time... Anyway my opinion worked wonderfully for me as I avoided stickers and stuck with cases only... My friend lost big on 2020 RMR. I think he had about $3000 USD worth. He sold them all for a huge loss. I got about 2000 prisma 2 cases for 2.5 cents each on buff and bought a bunch of other different cases. I sold them all for about 2.5 - 3 times what I paid for them and bought some very nice play skins which I have been using for the last few years. Little did I know that cases would go so high! I could have made 30 times my initial investment if I had just held on to those cases. Oh well. I have three knives and two pairs of gloves and a bunch of other skins. I almost bought a gamma doppler phase 4 butterfly knife but didn't think they looked that great in source one. So I got a low float MW autotronic butterfly knife. A vanilla skeleton knife, a fire and ice 9th talon FN. Low float MW cobalt skulls hand wraps and a low float and pretty clean looking pair of FT crimson weave driver gloves. My favourite skin is my printstream M4A1s with 666 stickers. One of the few skins I have that has stickers on it because it actually looks good. Sadly I don't think my inventory has increased that much with the recent interest in source 2. I'm pretty sure it was worth close to 6000 USD before all the hype and now it's 7000 USD. Kind of disappointing to be honest :-(. Especially since I am not wealthy and am looking to buy an old house which will need plenty of renovating. I will probably cash out everything in a few months time to help pay for the renovation. No I'm not going to fall for your scam if you're planning to add me and try and scam me... I get at least 10 people a day trying to scam me. I have Russian and Chinese friends that are constantly begging me to give them skins and sending me trades worth a couple of dollars in exchange for thousands of dollars worth of skins... LoL.

1684244169.0,2023-05-16,"Yo mate, no, I didn't miss that part at all. But what most people HERE are missing is that there's a massive difference of comparing texture resolution and polygoncount on a compressed video file (no matter if it's 4K or not) vs seeing that in the actual game on your 24-32 inch monitor undistorted/uncompressed. The graphic settings don't matter here because the 3D mesh/polygoncount is unaffected by them. And so far, 99,9% of this subreddit can't make that comparison past watching medium quality inspect videos/screenshots. The difference when comparing at your own PC will be way larger than you would've imagined it. That said, it doesn't really matter. People are paying 1000s of dollars for essentially ugly but rare stickers. They panic sell cloud9 holos for overinvested paris capsules that don't even include cloud9 stickers and you're telling me they wouldn't sell their old skins for new ones instantly? That's ridiculous. >I argued about new m4a4 model with a streamer(with 500+ viewers) who only streams sticker crafts. I told him only radiation hazard and some few other m4's using new model. the streamer insisted almost all m4a4's are using new model, called me delusional for thinking otherwise. his chat agreed with the streamer and called me L's. I gave up there. This 100% comes down to my first paragraph. It's pretty safe to assume that at least half of the playerbase still doesn't even know we're getting new models because not everyone is so enthusiastic about gaming and consuming news as we are. If everyone KNOWS that there are 2 models, people will have an easier time spotting the difference. Some people are just so superficial that they can't distinguish the difference between new shading and lighting from an actual different 3D model. And trust me this will be the ultimate definition of ""once seen, you can't unsee it"". The moment the majority of players will realize what to look for to distinguish old from new models, everyone will be able to. And you're also forgetting that CSGO suffered from way higher contrast which artificially makes skins have more depth and look more flashy. But if you would acutally compare the default CSGO model to the default CS2 model IN CS2, the difference can't be unseen. The CSGO AK looks hella more blurry. specifically for the Glock, USP, M4A4 and AK, the difference is more than just noticable. The new A4 looks absolutely fire compared to the original. Another thing I've spotted by the way is that some already ported skins are now corrupted in CSGO. Some examples are the Deagle Sputnik (which was shown on new model and reverted), M4A4 Faded Zebra (on new Model). If you inspect them in inventory, they are insanely pixelated and the pattern seems broken. I've spotted that for my M4A1-S Fizzy Pop aswell now which tells me that this is about to get ported aswell despite it hasn't been shown on the new model before. The reason that we only saw valve skins so far could be that it would be unfair to all the creators who didn't have their skin showcased on the new model as the ones that did got the artist higher revenue. You are seeing 2000h of work to ensure millions of $ wasted work? I can't follow this thought process. Valve knows pretty well that any change to a skin will instantly mess with the market. They know pretty well that old skins will make way less money if they stay old. I they were to release 20 cases with the launch of CS2, I'd be with you.

1685715594.0,2023-06-02,"Sorry this is going to be long and maybe a little disjointed. Going off memory but researching where I'm able. There were a lot of factors at play in SW investing. You can absolutely hold them but say you invested in The Rising Sun collection when it first came out with Operation Bloodhound in 2015. It'll be just over three years until the collection is discontinued and about four years from release before you start to see a meaningful rise in value. You could make x2 profit by trading between Operations if you time things well. It's not bad for the time period before investing had blown up. By the time of Shattered Web, investing was much bigger and people we're concentrating on items they believed wouldn't come back more than anything else. Shattered Web was the first time we had the stars system so it meant any investments from SW would come from the same 100 stars. You could earn up to 100 stars from playing the operation and buy extra stars. 100 Stars (£33.99) got you: 8 x Shattered Web Case 3 x Norse Collection Drop 3 x Canals Collection Drop 3 x St. Marc Collection Drop 8x Operation Shattered Web Stickers 6x Trolling Graffiti Collection 6x CS:GO Graffiti #2 Collection 4x Shattered Web Agents (1 of each rarity) There was investment hype around stickers and the case but not really much interest in the skins. For that reason you can see on many of the price graphs for SW collections that they really don't move much until Broken Fang drops a year later. This is despite having less supply (3k Wild Lotus) than collections such as Cobblestone (6.5k Dlore) or Gods and Monsters (4.5k Medusa). If it wasn't for the cases and stickers I think there would have been less supply but there was enough hype around those to generate a decent number of stickers. There was also a degree of wariness around the operation investments because this was the first time you could just straight up buy more rewards. In previous operations you had to make new accounts and play them to get more rewards than the pass gave you otherwise. People thought correctly there would be too much supply compared to the Hydra Case. Kinda contradictory to the case/sticker hype but the CSGO community isn't a universal mindset so both aspects played into what supply it resulted in. So then you come to Broken Fang, now you buy stars and spend them on what rewards you want, there's three new collections and you can already see the Shattered Web collections beginning to explode. Just before the end of Broken Fang you could already see desirable purple FT skins from the Norse collection hitting £100 having been only £40 prior to Broken Fang starting. Your 100 stars can net you 25 drops from an operation collection so naturally you see a lot more skins generated for this operation. Probably leads into why the Broken Fang case worked out better than the Shattered Web case in the long term. Desirability also plays into it of course, the supply of the M4A1-S Welcome To The Jungle only being around 3.5k even with Souvenirs. But for the very hyped Control collection you see 11k AWP Fades generated off of this. My tl;dr is that so many factors play into it: -not seeing skins as limited yet/cases and stickers more valued as investments -no choice on what stars are used for -desirable skins Either way it was very profitable for those of us that had norse, st marc and canal skins lying around after and I'm sure glad I only spent £30ish on my AUG Midnight Lily",0.107,0.777,0.116,0.5824,2

I was looking to pay around that price for minimal wear and I got lucky refreshing and saw someone that priced theirs super low. I still have to wait l3 more days to use it but I’m not complaining. I’m about to buy a set of Cool Grey Moto gloves and a Gamma Doppler Karambit or Flip knife for CT side but I’m holding back for just a bit to see what happens. Right now my whole inventory is Red themed so I’ll be having to change quite a bit to go blue themed. Either way I’ll be loading up on everything. I’m very likely to either buy a Blue Phosphor or Hot Rod M4A1-S if the prices keep dipping as well.,0.021,0.88,0.099,0.8551,3

1703433457.0,2023-12-24,"Honestly I really don't know, I don't even know how you'd go about selling it. I imagine not that many people would be interested either, it's a pretty big risk to buy a Steam account since the owner could reclaim it or it could easily be banned. On top of that I don't think too many people would even want a base m4a1-s with a Kato holo on it. I'm sure there are people interested, but I have no idea how you'd find them or what it could be worth.",0.069,0.755,0.176,0.6908,1
