Double tap headshots are going to be the norm with this weapon. Since you can't easily tell where someone with this gun is shooting you from, by the time you realize it, you will be dead. I see a new playing style that I am going to call the ""Dirty Camper"" coming into effect. Basically, you will have players who will rush to cheap spots to get a pick and then rotate away to another cheap spot waiting for another ambush. This really is the ideal playing style with this weapon due to the small magazine size and overall ammo capacity. This is not a weapon for people who like to spray their bullets, push aggressively, or try to hold rushes from defensive positions. This is the weapon for the ""thinking-man"" who has the game sense enough to know when to engage and when to fall back. Because of this I see this weapon being used mainly in the higher ranks once the lower rank users get past the ""new weapon"" frenzy. The USP is basically a P2000, so there isn't any reason for almost all players to adopt it unless you really hate having to unscrew the silencer or you have no bullet management and spray at everything. This should actually help on Pistol rounds by allowing CTs to play a little more passively and smartly since their positions (when silenced) aren't going to be given away as easily. **EDIT:** Also, unless I am wrong, by opening the options menu while dead, you can click on Inventory and change your loadout, thus swapping the M4A1-S for the M4A4, P2000 for USP, or skinned gun for non-skinned gun.",0.176,0.757,0.067,-0.9887,8

1379189874,2013-09-14,"As far as I know, there really is no point in taking the suppressor off of your m4a1-s or usp. I am pretty sure that it doesn't affect the accuracy at all when you take it off but if makes your guns a whole lot louder (obviously). The only reason I could think of taking your suppressor off is it makes your gun model not as long. I have had many experiences where I am playing as a terrosrist and I am sneaking around a corner and what do you know, I see a big suppressor sticking out of the corner. If he would have taken the suppressor off or used a regular m4a4, I would not have known he was there. Now comparing the m4a4 to the m4a1-s, the m4a1-s is more accurate (because of the suppressor) than the m4a4 but it obviously has way less ammo. So you can decide if you want to sacrifice ammo or accuracy. Now in regards to burst fire mode, the Famas burst fire actually serves a purpose. If you were to switch to burst fire mode and fire a three round burst, it would be a lot more accurate than if you were to have it in regular full auto mode and only fire a 3 round burst. So use the famas 3 round burst in long range engagements. If you crouch and fire the Famas in burst fire mode, it is extremely accurate and deadly. The Glock burst fire mode is different. You can chose to use the burst fire mode in close range engagements as it fires 3 bullets very quickly, much faster than you would be able to fire 3 bullets in semi-auto mode. The catch is that the burst mode for the Glock is pretty inaccurate. So I would advise never using the burst fre mode in medium to long range engagements. Only use it when you know an enemy is close around the corner and you just need to throw some lead downrange as quickly as possible. edit: And by the way, I think you mean right mouse button pros and cons.

No guns in the game have usable [iron sights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_sights). The Aug (and SG553 for terrorists) have an ACOG scope. They are both available under the 'rifle' section of the buy menu and are some of the few guns in the game to have any form of scope. (Others are the AWP and the SSG08 (Scout)). The drops you get for playing (or that you can buy in the marketplace) are simply skins to make your knife/guns look nicer. They are purely cosmetic and they don't give you additional guns or change their configuration at all. So, the Aug you picked up in the game was probably skinned, but if you bought it on your own in that match, it would function exactly the same. There are a few items in your inventory that give you different guns in-game, but you already have those and can swap them in/out of your loadout. M4A4 (more ammo) vs M4A1-S (silenced); P2000 (more ammo) vs USP (silenced). You don't need to buy anything (or wait for drops) to get an advantage in CS:GO. It's all skill, awareness, and teamwork.

There's no ranking system and you join servers with random people. Nades kill you if you're hit by them even with full armour, flashes blind you way longer. Deagle is a sick sidearm and you can wall bang basically any wall. It remains untouched in terms of updates and what not. Source hasn't been updated for a long time, which isn't a bad thing. The game play is similar to 1.6 but wall banging through any wall has been removed. Updated graphics and maps from 1.6 is really the main difference. Nades don't do as much damage and flashes don't blind as long. CSGO is where everyone is right now. 5 million unique players in the last month according to the main menu. It introduces a ranking system and a pretty good balance of the weapons. There's 2 different main rifles for CT. M4A1-S with a silencer and 20 bullet magazine and the M4A4 with no silencer and 30 bullet clips. The Deagle isn't as powerful as 1.6 or CSS which was the first thing that turned me off of CSGO, but I now see it as a weapon that must be mastered to get its full effect (search YouTube for a 'ScreaM Deagle csgo' video to see what I mean).

1426237455,2015-03-13,"It's ok, everyone has trouble learning new things sometimes. an eco, is where you buy cheap, ( usually pistols ) along with equipment that can include flashbangs, smoke grenades and explosive grenades or even kevlar. A save is where you don't buy anything at all. As for full buying, you usually want Kevlar &amp; Helmet along with a Primary weapon before anything else, make sure you have enough money to buy both. Then if you have excess after that, defuse kit and a smoke and/or flashbang. After that you can buy a explosive grenade, then fire grenades and then you buy pistols. I'm assuming you've learn't what are some of the main weapons and most cost-to-usefulness. But just in-case, here is some order of what you probably should use: Rifles - AK-47, M4A1-S, M4A4, FAMAS, Galil Snipers - AWP, Scout Shotguns - Nova, MAG-7 SMGS - MP9, MP7, UMP Pistols - CZ-75, P250, Tec-9 AK-47, M4A1-S, M4A4, AWP, MAG-7, are all fullbuy weapons, which are acceptable to use if you have acquit money. Scout, Nova, MP9, MP7, UMP, CZ-75, P250, Tec-9 are all weapons which are for low money buys, which are called force-buys. Where you buy using what money you have to give yourself a higher chance to win the round. When to forcebuy, eco, and save? It depends on the situation. But these are some rules to follow: If you just lost the pistol round, eco's are a good way to boost your chances to win the next round. If you're (x)-15. And the other team is about to win, force-buying to give yourself the highest chance to win and continue another round is the best idea. You win pistol round, but lose second round. Save.

First thing first, almost all pro players right now are using the M4a1, this does not mean it is better for you but they certainly do use it for a reason.

At the high level players are able to pull off some filthy things like sprays all the way up mid, and at the low level the recoil is much easier to control.

1442360083,2015-09-15,"This week we’re releasing a new player animation system for CS:GO. For a complete list of changes, see below. The new system modernizes the player’s skeleton and hitboxes to better express at-a-glance exactly what your enemies and teammates are doing. We’ve upgraded all the existing body animations, and added some new ones like visible weapon deploys, bomb defusing, and ladder-climbing. [ ANIMATION / GAMEPLAY ] * Replaced all player body animations (Existing character models retained for demo compatibility) * Replaced all world model weapon animation * Updated shared player skeleton * Re-rigged all player model geometry and player scaffold animation * Updated animation networking to continually synchronize animation state instead of periodically latching * Player animation sequence selection is now server-initiated * Added new player states including bomb defusal and ladder climb poses * Added thirdperson weapon deploy animations to more accurately represent viewmodel deploy state * Extended all vertical aim matrix ranges to encompass the majority of vertical aim pitch so weapons line up precisely to firing angle * Added reverse-bone-merge animation support so weapon models can store and play independent animation on the player holding them * Added support for arbitrary numbers of articulated mechanical parts on world weapon models * Updated weapon world model articulation points, bodygroup presets, holster positions and reverse-bone-merge skeletons * Added physics motion to holstered attachment weapon locations * Added support for non-polygonal capsule-shaped hit volumes, defined by a line segment and radius * Replaced shared hitboxes with new capsule-based set * Rebuilt player ragdoll angular constraints, physics hulls, and interaction pairs * Ragdolls now assume more exact pose of their parent player on physics init * Re-built animation statemachine to support blending locomotion over any weapon aim or action poses * Enabled support for dynamic player animation layer re-ordering * Sequence blendlayers now correctly contribute to computed cyclerate * Added defuser cables and multimeter model * Added hlmv support for capsule rendering, submodel attachment previewing, ragdoll constraint limit and bone name rendering, plus numerous small fixes * Added model format support for named bodygroups, combined physics hulls, activity modifiers and animation system specific metadata [ UI ] * Fixed a bug where the mini-scoreboard armor/helmet information was not displaying for coaches * Added sv_show_voip_indicator_for_enemies server convar. If set, it will make it so the ‘voice chat’ icon shows over enemy players as well as allies when they are using their microphone. * Added sv_showbullethits feature to visualize server-confirmed hits and near-misses on listen servers [ RENDERING ] * Fixed improper stencil state in glow pass rendering [ GAMEPLAY ] * Added dynamic player culling to prevent players and weapons poking through thin walls and revealing their position M4A1-S: * Reduced price * Reduced armor penetration * Reduced ROF * Increased base spread Zeus x27 * Reduced price to $100 Dual Berettas * Increased armor penetration * Increased range modifier [ GOTV ] * Added viewmodel position lerp to gotv camera transitions [ OVERWATCH ] * Players can now report enemies for anti-competitive griefing (i.e. deliberately losing).

1442397074,2015-09-16,"[This video from 3kliksphilip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCbRs6Cipqo) explains it very well, but just in case: When the week starts (I believe the week resets every thursday), you recieve your regular xp plus 3x bonus XP (so if you get 60 regular xp, you get 180 bonus.) As soon as you acquired around 3.5k bonus, the bonus drops to 1x. (60 + 60) At a total of around 5.000 bonus xp (=&gt; 2 levels/10k xp) you no longer get a bonus, and at around 12.5k total, you get a reduced multiplier on the regular xp. Now for the Operation passes. By buying the operation pass for around 5.00€ (last month: 2.50€), you gain access to the missions and the booklet of said operation. These missions award you with xp for completing them (easy missions: 200xp, hard/longterm missions up to 600xp). So, no, you don't directly ""buy"" additional drops. You do aid in getting that weekly xp based drop though. Remember that random drops are still what they are called - random. They are not associated with the XP. If you complete a branch of the mission tree, you eventually get operation stars. These are used to level up the tier of your operation coin, which is added to your inventory as soon as you activate the pass. In Bloodhound, there are two mission pages (Marksman &amp; Revolution), and on each page, you can earn 9 stars. You need 9 stars for the silver coin, and 14 for the gold in Bloodhound. You do not need to buy the pass to play on the Operation maps, but having it gives you a more or less handy digital book, recording your performance on missions and - more importantly - competitive matches. These books will always be accessible from your inventory by clicking on the coin. Old passes, such as the pass from Operation Vanguard, are no longer obtainable. The maps usually get dropped from the game as soon as the operation ends. (with exceptions such as Season, which was already featured in Vanguard and is currently active in Bloodhound). You can find the maps on the workshop though, if you wish to replay them or watch a saved GOTV on said map. I can only recommend getting the coin/pass early on. It is more expensive, but it's fun having a twist in the game without being rushed to do missions just for the golden coin. If you wish, you can still get the coin. But you're gonna have to bingeplay if you wish to get to that golden coin. You have 15 days. :D Good luck, hope I helped! EDIT: Maybe you have more time than until beginning of october. Just remembered that Vanguard was extended by a month as well.",0.021,0.755,0.224,0.9989,2

(AK-47, M4A4, M4A1-S, SG 553, AUG, Galil AR, FAMAS, MAC-10, MP9, MP7, UMP-45, PP-Bizon, &amp; P90) Learn the rifles first as they're more important. Know how to line up smokes, flashes, &amp; incendiary grenades/molotov cocktails. There are maps on the workshop to practice grenades. Here's one for [Mirage](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=496123922). If you look at that person's workshop, they have made practice maps for other maps such as Dust II and Overpass if you like to play those maps. Know which angles you are exposed to when you stand in a certain area on a map. This will be useful for terrorist side. There are some prefire maps on the workshop which help you learn which spots counter-terrorists will usually play from. Here's one for [Dust II](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=694731018). Again, if you take a look at that person's workshop, they have also made prefire maps for other maps. Understand the economy of the game. Do not force buy every round. I see so many people in the lower ranks buying SMGs while they're on the terrorist side when they can't afford a rifle. It's better to just buy a pistol such as the P250, Tec-9, or Desert Eagle. Only buy an SMG on the terrorist side if you won the pistol round and want to build up your economy (SMGs have a $600 kill award). And don't buy if your team isn't buying. If 4 of your teammates can't afford to buy but you have money to buy, just save. At most, just buy yourself some armour. Don't ""spray"" with pistols unless the person is very close to you. When at any other distance, go for slow and accurate shots over rapid and careless spraying. I see many people in the lower ranks panic with their pistols and fire their whole clip and only hit their enemy once. Remain calm with pistols and you will get easy frags. Another thing, if it's terrorist side pistol round and you have a Glock and see a USP-S or a P2000 on the ground, **pick it up**. Have good crosshair placement. Do not have your crosshair pointed at the ground. Keep your crosshair at head level and always keep it pointed where you think someone is going to be. Learn how to hold bombsites and mid. [voo CSGO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2vjGuOTH-KcRCLSm5F3oUA) has a load of helpful videos on this topic. Here's one on [how to hold mid on Dust2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pLC1tk6vZM). And make sure you always keep an eye on the radar. The radar is vital when it comes to having good game sense. If you are playing on CT side, the radar shows you if the bomb has been spotted by one of your teammates which is very important in solo queue as there's usually no communication in solo queue. It shows you where your teammates are which lets you know which areas are covered which in turn lets you know which areas you are most vulnerable from. There's definitely a lot more to learn about this game as it is very intricate. These are just some of the basics. With time and practice, it can pretty much all be learned. What's most important about this game is having fun. Make sure you have fun. If you lose and have a bad game, remember that it's just a game and there are good games to be had in the future.

1510946955,2017-11-17,"There are many youtubers that if you watch them play and explain their actions, will slowly make you better at the game. When I first started playing csgo I was a very instinctive player and I wouldn't reallly think about what I was doing. I recommend watching HOUNGOUNGAGNE and N0thing (Professional player). They both play smart and explain what they do and why they do it pretty well. Game sense is crucial when playing CS:GO. Good luck, and when you feel like it we can play sometime. (I do live in Europe though, so time zones may be difficult to navigate around.) EDIT: **Some steps to becoming a better player: (Make this your bullet list)** **Learn** spray patterns for the AK-47 and the M4A4 or the M4A1S. **Choose** which of the two guns work best for you. (The M4A4 or the M4A1S. Plenty of comparison videos on that.) **Decide** between tap firing, burst firing or spraying to take down an opponent. **Crosshair** placement. Super important, keep your crosshair at head level the whole time and not at crotch level. **Learn** smokes, flashes and how to throw them properly. **Memorize** call-outs on all maps. (Names for common places for an opponent to be.) There is always the name of the location you're in displayed on the top left corner of your screen when you play which will help. **Don't** just buy random things at the beginning of a round. The money you have to spend isn't your money, it's the teams money. A teams economy is very important in CS:GO. If you just lost the first pistol round, don't buy anything. That way you will save money that you can spend for the next round. It's better to be have the whole team well equipped than only you having an AWP and the rest just playing with pistols. And also if you do have plenty of money, don't buy 5 AWP's for the team. **Learn** how to strafe. (Plenty of videos on that.) **Practice** your aim by playing Deathmatch (Not the Valve version) or by going on the Steam Workshop and downloading some aim maps. **Make** sure to play on all of the Active Duty maps (Mirage, Cache, Overpass, Cobblestone, Train, Inferno, Nuke) and not just Dust 2. **Rank** up by playing with friends that you can rely on. **Be** nice to your teammates. They'll be nice to you in return. (Normally.) **Lastly,** just play the game as much as you can so that you start to learn all the common angles or spots a opponent might be lurking around. **Hope this helped and best of luck!**",0.023,0.791,0.186,0.997,1

1522940790,2018-04-05,"&gt; Is this still possilbe today? Yes. CSGO uses scripts for complex key binds which can include multi-buy setups. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAuP09GYYqE) and read [this](https://gamebanana.com/scripts/games/4660) for more info. &gt; How do you start them today? You can still use console; type 'status' into the console which will give you a list of all players and a number for each of them, then type 'callvote kick #' with the number of the player you want to dump. It's easier to use the GUI though - hit escape, choose Call Vote from the menu and go from there. &gt; Rankings There are two ranks. The first is level; you get xp from each game (in any official mode so not community servers) and level up to 40 when you can reset the rank and get a Service Medal (a bit like prestige in CoD). Also, you need to be level 21 to access Prime Matchmaking whereby you link your phone number to your Steam account and get access to Prime comp games; typically these see less cheaters. The second type is your matchmaking rank. You have one for matchmaking comp games (5v5) and one for Wingman games (2v2). Once you have a rank, Valves matchmaking software will try to put you in comp / wingman games with other players of the same or similar ranks. Rank is explained more [here](https://dotesports.com/counter-strike/news/csgo-rankings-explained-14168#list-1). In terms of game play, there is no levelling. Every character has the same abilities / skills / speed as every other. Counter Strike is about the player, not the character. &gt; couldnt find the M4A1 CSGO has a load-out system and the M4A4 and M4A1-S share the same spot, so you can only have one available at a time. To change, on the menu screen go to 'Inventory' then 'Loadout' - you can choose skin and weapon selections seperatly for CT &amp; T - the M4A1-S is under CT-side Rifles. &gt; Are the kevlar vest and helmet automatically purchased, free? Depends on game mode. In comp and wingman NO, they are not. You must choose to buy them - $650 for kevlar, $1000 for kevlar &amp; helmet. We don't buy ammo anymore though. In casual and wargames you get given armor each round free. &gt; Am I able to carry only one FB? No, in comp / wingman games you can have a total of 4 grenades from a max of 2 fb, 1 he, 1 smoke, 1 molly, 1 decoy. On a full buy I'll take 1 each of he, smoke, fb and molly but sometimes I'll drop the molly for a 2nd fb. &gt; In the stats it says: K - A - D Kills - Assists - Deaths Assists are given when you damage a player for at least 50 health (assuming you start with 100). In-game assists just add to your score. If you want some advice, I'd recommend trying not to bring too much knowledge from older versions.

It has fewer bullets and worse damage at long range, but the silencer makes it difficult to figure out where you are shooting from, as T, so it's pretty much very valid option.",0.104,0.803,0.093,0.0552,1

1696016504.0,2023-09-29,I’m not too serious about this game but I don’t think there’s much difference.

1696059574.0,2023-09-30,Bro it’s still CS. AWP is AWP. Krieg/AUG are better than AK/M4 but usually not worth the extra money. M4 vs M4A1S is preference. MP9/MAC10 are the best SMGs. LMGs don’t matter and the shotguns are fine on eco if you wanna switch it up.,0.038,0.753,0.209,0.8443,1

M4A1-S seems to have some weirdness to its spray, as I heard from multiple people. AK the same, but I’m getting used to it actually. Famas is hated, but I kinda like it in CS2. Galil is liked a bit more, I think it’s identical to CSGO. Scout and AWP have been temporarily nerfed, because flicks work very differently due to the sub tick system. Hence people have to get used to it first, until they can properly hold angles with them again. Also the bad Peak advantage makes holding angles really hard. Glock is subjectively insane now, I have no idea if there is more to it than placebo. Since people are still getting used to the game, shotguns and SMGs are super strong.

1697286186.0,2023-10-14,"Sounds like map awareness. Most of the older players like myself (been playing since 2002) have most of the maps memorized to a T. Learning crosshair placement is really important, watch some pro videos on youtube to see how you keep your crosshair in the center of your screen as much as you can. Learn the spray patterns for the AK/M4A4/M4A1-S. This is really important each gun has it's own pattern of fire, and you'll want to learn those 3 at least. Also the AK has AMAZING, and I mean amazing 1-tap kills. If you learn to fire 1 bullet at a time with the gun you can get 1 shot kills to the dome, extremely accurate too. Learn Smoke and Flash Nade line-ups. Again really important, find some videos on it, learn the line-ups. Test them in practice games with bots until you get them down and don't take too long to line them up.

You can also download some aim training or recoil control maps from the workshop, it’s quite effective and actually kinda fun. Play around with the different weapons, get a feel for em. The M4A1-S is a good choice for newer players because the spray pattern is more controllable and the price is a bit lower than the M4A4. Most importantly, remember this: you’re going to die. You’re going to die *a lot.* Many of those deaths will seem unfair, or even not possible with human reflexes. Get used to failure, especially early on.
