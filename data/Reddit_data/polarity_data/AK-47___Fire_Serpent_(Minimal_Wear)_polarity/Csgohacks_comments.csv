My second account was made in 2016 when i was invited to skeet and novo it remained unbanned until it got overwatched last year. i mainly semi raged and closeted on it as i was in the weird green trust where its either a 5 stack of semi ragers or legits. the account before ban had a fire serpent and an m9 slaughter as overwatch bypass, the m9 made it off but the fire serpent and greeds fire serpent were banned. so basically retaliation cheating turned me into a money flexing unknown semi rager that lost money in the end",0.243,0.74,0.017,-0.9777,7
