1570846686,2019-10-12,Very true. Just check the price of the StatTrack Factory new AWP Oni Taiji lol. I bought one a few months ago and I'm projecting it to rise to around $800 as it couldn't be worth more than a Medusa but perhaps the same price of a Fire Serpent.,0.09,0.83,0.08,-0.1246,2

1570860510,2019-10-12,"You would be right to think that but just look at the ratio of supply of the StatTracks versus the Non StatTracks. Once the non StatTracks start getting sold. I guarantee you the price will mirror the Fire Serpent rather Closely. Edit, I think around 2nd quarter of next year is when we'll see a breakout in its price. Also, History tends to repeat itself with high tier skins. Just check the ""Lifetime"" History Chart of the Awp Medusa Field Tested. It just shot up from $300 to $700 then took off from there. Oh and to top it off. It's from the Hydra Case, so there's that as well. Edit 2. To answer your question. It could just be the growth in weed culture? With steady growth of the eSports industry yields lots of publicity to CSGO so just as many new NA players are starting to play CSGO as well as China. Also, Free to play helped out too. To answer your question short though I'd say the price is Rising because the supply is drying up.",0.016,0.845,0.14,0.9731,1
