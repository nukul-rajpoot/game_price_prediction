They are given to you randomly at the end of a match. This is any match that is played on a VAC secured server. So Deathmatch, Competitive, Arms Race, all that jazz. Now when you get a skin you can equip it then and it won't cost you anything. If you get a case you need to buy a key to unlock it.

You just have to know how to put together the computer which is also VERY easy. Literally just plug Y into X. This might not be the VERY best efficient build, but it's a very very strong build for $384. Sure you could use a cheaper motherboard and go with an Athlon II and get similar performance to this one EXCEPT with the b75 and i3-3220, in the future you could replace the i3-3220 with an i7 from ivy bridge generation. The b75 motherboard allows for future upgrade as its native ivy bridge socket. The 500w PSU allows for future GPU upgrade as well. Reasons why i3 &gt; i5 in terms of gaming: i3 and i5 perform nearly the same if not the same frame rates it's just i5 is stronger in terms of rendering videos and high cpu intensive programs. 4GB of ram &gt; 8 GB of ram IN TERMS OF GAMING as most games do not even fully utilize the 4 GB 8 GB is an overkill unless your planning on having 10+ tabs open in chrome while gaming or if you plan on video editing.

I am not too sure if any hooking or injection is done then by ""Garena"" (http://imgur.com/3zuyOWj) I am pretty sure he doesn't hack. I was there with him when this happen, playing some casual matches. Halfway through, he got banned so there goes his account. Now, i know VAC is really good but as i originally stated, VAC isn't perfect so assuming everyone is a hacker is an outright irresponsible and ultimately arrogant act by Valve. With proof such as event logs and system snapshots upon the detection though may be delayed, Valve should at the very least do an investigation and see possible vac loopholes and to patch them and improve it. Instead they just went like nope, you hack bye bye. If it's something in his computer, the appropriate evidence should be enough to replicate the detection but atlas, it's too late now. He sent tickets in for 2 months straight to be ignored and assumed to be hacking without proper investigation. Rarely do you see such a big company like Valve get away with negligence and poor bs support. I even suggested him to write to Gabe directly. Doesn't work obviously ** To Summarise: -Not 100% sure if my friend is innocent -My friend has appropriate evidence that should be enough for valve to replicate -Send tickets to Steam Support for 2 months, no investigation done -Valve assumes VAC is 100% correct which it is not :( *PS* That vac discussion ""forum"" is really interesting",0.105,0.709,0.185,0.984,2

1444043741,2015-10-05,"We are human beings so it's only logical that other people need less time to achieve something, everyone gets born totally different. Also, CS:GO isn't really the game to compare yourself to your friends based on skills as CS:GO is a random based game instead of purely skillbased like it's predecessor Counter-Strike 1.6 or a diff. skillbased game like Quake 3. In CS:GO you can play it for the very first time ever and 2 months later beat a top 20 team of the world, and the day itself losing against some kids that just installed the game, the game is way too random based, hence why every event even at the top level has a different top 10 every time. CS:GO's biggest difference with 1.6 which made the game seriously random based was the first bullet accuracy, accuracy overall, spray patterns which were more consistent, recoil control being more consistent and trustable (in GO even if you control it perfectly the bullets fly everywhere around anyway which is totally random, such bullshit from Valve), every hallway and area being smaller than 1.6, therefor CT's having easier time smoking a whole entrance, and even easier to spray in narrow halls (banana or Inf mid for example) therefor having another big aspect which shows again that CS:GO is not a skillbased game as because of the narrow halls and area's you don't need the perfect aim or reflex. Like me, play CS:GO casual for fun, even though I play it 2 hours a week I've been Global for over 2 years now but stopped playing since 8ish months when Valve changed the MM system and made it easy for noobs so that basicly everyone being Silver-Eagle being Supreme now and everyone being Supreme-GE is Global now, they basicly deleted all other ranks. Play FaceIT like me and my friends now and then, don't take CS serious anymore because it's not, newgens today don't have the luck we had in 1999-2007, they need to ""base"" their ""competitive game"" on luck instead of raw skills. Having time for a wall of text because I'm at my job and it's very calm. :p Big proof I have for myself and my friends is that we haven't played any shooter/FPS game since 2007 after quitting CS. When we bought CS:GO 2ish years ago we only needed 1-2 weeks (15ish hours) to get our aim back and beat teams on 128tr servers like myKPV, OverGaming (ex-x6tence/Wizards), planetKey(?). Beated myKPV 16-2 on D2 and OverGaming 16-4 on cache, I killed FlipiN like 7 times in a row on mid with a 1 bullet headshot, that's when I knew, Valve fucked up. Eventhough I've beated teams like x6tence before @ 1.6, after only playing CS:GO for 1-2 weeks after a 7 year gaming break and beating semi- &amp; proteams is exaggurated. tl;dr: Stop caring, CS:GO is a random based game anyway.",0.071,0.775,0.154,0.988,1

I only play on the weekends, Friday and saturday those are the only day's that i have enough time around work and my social life to sit down and play CSGO....However it is CRITICAL that (for me) I play sunday/monday/wed for 10-20minutes in warmup only, i typically just play against bots, and just run around the map killing people. this way you dont come back on friday and have a week's worth of rust.....it keeps you ""on top of your game"" threw-out the week. Before the game start's , sometimes if i die early in then round, and at the half way mark, i step away from my desk and run my hands under WARM WATER...this helps keep my hands loose, warm, and able to press the right keys in those clutch situations which out fumbling. I'd say solo Q is good till distingusted MG and than a party is a must....But for GNM and or MG1 a partner is almost neccicary (if you're doing a long session of CSGO) . With this i stress the importance of ""DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST"" what i mean by this is i've seen countless people angry or start to hate the game and go on tilt half way threw the game because "" i didnt get that one kill 10 rounds ago"" or so on.... The point is, the current round is all that is important, dont have your mind set on the past rounds...CROOSSS HAIR PLACEMENT, it doesn't matter what you're doing ALSO have your crosshair placed in the opertune position in case an enemy comes around that corner that you wern't expecting, and dont aim low....Always aim chest/head level so if you were to flick them, you would have a higher chance of killing....i will some times go bottom fragger for my team, because i'll be dedicated entry....and as long as i do a good job of what im suppost be to doing, thats a success regardless of my K/D/A i could be 3k/12d but that stilll be a success...always keep your calm.... i've been called a robot by my friends before, becuase i dont overreact....I could get the most insane jump flick no scope from long on dust2 and haven't said anything, while my teammates are going ape shit over com's for what they saw....or when you're losing don't go on tilt even if you're getting 0/16'd don't worry about your rank also...its all about know you're improving rather than the reflection of your rank (as you mentioned that you were getting deranked in MG1, it's a visual, letting you know there is room for improvment.)... also its a game so have fun :) terrible grammar but guess what deal with it &lt;3 sorry for long post hope you can take something from it and help get",0.114,0.74,0.146,0.9413,3

1450311690,2015-12-17,"Focus on your aim, positioning, and game sense. Obviously that's pretty much all there is to the game, but it is the only way to get better. All three of those things working simultaneously is a beautiful thing, and is only achieved by people are at a really high level. Of course, there are other key factors like teamwork, strats, and a much larger understanding of the game. However, we're just focusing on ranking up. If you have good aim already, focus on positioning. Figure out how long it takes for people to reach certain points of the map. Call those points choke points, and focus in on them. A lot of good players can hone in on their skill, and observe an enemy team and their habits. From this, they can pinpoint when a player will be at a location which will allow them to react accordingly. This could result in a push that gets them an easy frag early round, or a great CT bomb site defense. On Dust, a few ""Choke points"" could be: [Upper Tunnels] [Cat stairs] [Outside connector] [Mid]. These are all places where you will find Terrorists tend to stack up on each other. If you can force the enemy team into these locations via map control, and strategic positioning - you're doing your team a big favor. Positioning also applies to yourself. A lot of kills I get at my rank are because I was in the right place at the right time. I'm sure you've experienced the opposite. Positioning falls into the category of setting up kills, crossfire, and trades. A general rule of thumb is nobody on your team should die without somebody on the enemy team also being killed. If a lone frag happens (Somebody on either team dies without a trade) that is HUGE advantage towards the other team. That essentially put the round in an unbalanced position without any casualties. (Unbalanced meaning the one team has more players alive then the other). Stuff like this is a big deal towards higher ranks, and is also why people get flamed for pushing a site and instantly dying. Positioning kinda falls under game sense. Game sense is an extremely broad, and grey topic that not many people talk about which you've probably already found it. It kinda pisses me off that more professional players don't talk about their understanding of the game, why they made certain decisions, etc. They sorta leave it up to you to repeatedly watch demos and decipher stuff yourself - which at times can be extremely difficult. However, I'll have to be hypocritical here because I'm also not going to talk about game sense in this (hopefully small) post. One of the biggest misconceptions, and I was just talking to my scrim teammate about, is: You do NOT get game sense just from playing the game. You may see a small gain or improvement in your decision making skills, but it's unlikely. That's simply because when you play MM or a casual rotation map. You will play how you play, you won't learn anything because you are simply playing. You definitely can't learn from yourself. So, from that conclusion, you have to watch other people. I know a lot of people won't agree with this - but that's why it's my opinion. Watching people who are better then you play is an extremely important thing which a lot of people overlook. I can go watch and analyze a match between two pros, and gain more knowledge about smokes, flashes, strategies, positioning, etc then I would've playing 100 matches in matchmaking. That's only because when I play matchmaking, I'm playing with people equally skilled and I'm simply not going to learn anything from them.

You could mount a monitor over your bed frame that would be at a comfortable viewing angle for you, and have it on a pivoting axis that can be locked into place thereby preventing it from moving while laying down. Afterwards you could invest in some hard surface to lay on your bed on either side of you and use a small keypad for your movement (only really need like 8 buttons) and another on the other side for your mouse. All of this except for the monitor could theoretically be wireless as well. Beyond that you could get a lap desk if you can sit up in bed.

1451164840,2015-12-26,"* If you can, always play with someone you know, that way you have someone who's callouts you can actually rely on. * Always listen to the footsteps and know where they are coming from. (I.E. From Stairs/Lower tunnel on Dust II you should be able to tell the difference between someone entering upper tunnels vs. cat/mid) This boosts your game sense significantly and makes for easy prefires/kills. * On the same note of listening, make sure you don't have music play and use a bind to turn off everyone's voice, especially in tense situations. For me, I put [ bind ""l"" voice_enable 0 ], minus the brackets. This sets the L key (you can choose any key you like) to turn off all voice communication and I use it whenever I'm last alive, right after hearing any teammates callouts. Last thing I need is a random or just a toxic player messing me up and keeping me from hearing my surroundings. * Don't be afraid to take chances, especially if you're new. Meta can be easily broken if you do something unexpected, but if it doesn't work, don't keep doing it. * Be a team player and use your mic when needed, call it out once as soon as you can but don't keep spamming the mic with the same intel. * As OP said, keep a cool head. At the end of the day, it IS just a game and what someone says in-game should not get under your skin. Mute toxic players, as they are not going to provide you with anything but rage, and keep at it even when it seems impossible.

1451171100,2015-12-26,"I've been playing a little over 200 hours now and here's what I've learned so far as a newbie to the game. * Avoid Casual unless you want to warm up a bit. In my opinion casual is extremely counter productive because it's a mixed bag of skilled players and trolls. You get kicked for the dumbest reasons, most often because you didn't clutch versus 10 people with the bomb set. * Focus your efforts on competitive. The second half to my first point, this is where I've learned 95% of the game from. You can hand pick maps if you'd like to learn them as you grow more comfortable playing different ones. You learn to play as a team and the community in comp isn't as toxic(to me anyways) as opposed to Casual play. * ASK QUESTIONS. You'll never learn everything from observing people because they already know what they're doing. Anecdote: I didn't know what that little tunnel you crawl under in Inferno was, so I politely asked my team the callout, they informed me it was known as Vietnam or Mexico. * Commit to the damn play and have confidence. Too many times someone has called a rush and people just freeze when the first one to push gets dropped. I get that you should probably shift momentum if they've countered with mollys or smoke of their own but they won't be able to handle 5 men running through to a site. * Callouts, Callouts, Callouts. Communication is key to this game and not getting steamrolled. Even if you're not very good at peeks and aiming for the head(I used to be a body aimer for a long time), calling out can assist someone who better knows how to handle it if you died in a firefight. * Block out the haters. Some people good and bad at the game will try and tilt you because they have nothing better to do and want easy picks from angry mistake-prone players. Mute them, it isn't hard. If they're on your own team mute them anyways, you have 3 others who probably muted him too and just want to focus on the game with you.

I'm currently 500dpi and 2.8 sensitivity....but this post has reminded me to reduce the settings so I'll probably reduce to 500dpi and 2.6 sensitivity.

All of this has to be done in seconds, but with practice you wont even need to think about it. Always be a step ahead of yourself and always be a step ahead of your potential enemies.

If I do play on a team it would be to be an entry fragger, leave the knees weak and make them wait around corners instead of standing in the open thinking they can outaim. I don't want a run-and-gun shooter, as that turns into spam when the movement is so fast nobody in the world can hit the shots / if they do hit the shots it's luck... And most of the time the weapons that do decent damage are time travel ones and you have to guess where the enemy will end up in order to hit them, like league of legends stuff. CoD has fixed recoil, it does not penalize you for missing the shots, it penalizes you for not keeping your crosshair on the enemy as you hold the shoot key. Quake and Unreal Tournament do not have any recoil as I recall. I enjoy recoil cuz it really makes the adrenaline rush that much better when you hit with the first flickshot rather than spamming/spray n praying. Controlling recoil requires mouse movements and you can't move during either, it requires a lot more focus and setting up. So CS:GO did great getting graphics and cool little hooh-hah's in there but why did they penalize long range ballsy shots by default by making them less likely to hit? I don't understand the motive... Maybe they wanted smokes and flashes to be used more often and for the enemies to get close range before they finish each other off. Well, change the maps you make, if you want cs_office like environments, make the maps like that. Don't force players to look for bigger targets on their screen before they may take take the shot. It seems immature as a game designer. I feel they've done a poor job of the way they made smokes and flashes more useful. It seems the new CS (CS:GO) is all for viewers and not for the players pleasure at all. I feel gamers are being cheated of their skill for the pleasure of viewers. It doesn't have to be this way...

Like a special feature that WH only when the ennemi is in close range distance, with a red bone to specify to not look @him because it would be suspect. You can active this silent aim which will makes the bullets go magically where you configures it : head, neck, chest, without aiming it, but to be not so easily detectable they can configure a Angle of View that idicates to the aimbot to trigger himsef only when you're in a close range.

1462232285,2016-05-02,"People are giving some terrible advice here. Never listen to someone who tells you to cheap out on a computer. You're working with a good budget, and can build something that'll run great for 6-8 years of gaming. You'll get much more value per dollar long term. And play much more than just csgo. Or any new cs. To narrow down spending a bit more, what do you need? Just the tower, or mouse/monitor/keyboard as well? If you need a monitor do you prefer 1440p or 1080p? I would recommend 1080p BC 144hz and much lower total input lag. Good for fps games. You can get an Asus vg248qe for 170 shipped on newegg. Building your own PC is a very easy task, maybe takes an hour or two to do. I built my first computer at age 11, with no internet and nobody to help. Anyone can do it. The toughest part is picking out proper parts. Which is what we're here for! This is everything you'll need: CPU: I recommend an i7. 4790k or 6700k. $300-350 Motherboard: try to spend 120-170. No need to go for a ""gaming"" mobo...just something with good reviews. (I chose the gigabyte z97-ud5h for my 4790k). If you spend a bit more on the 6700k and corresponding motherboard, you can get a faster solid state drive...worth it imo. Video card: right now, go with amd. They are outperforming nvidia in many cases, and are more optimized for future games as well. A fury x will be a great card. $550-600. Solid state drive: $100-250...depending on your motherboard selection. And size/speed. Storage hard drive:60-100. Depends how big you want. They're cheap now. Ram: 16gb...it's cheap. Shop for a good deal. Fancy heatspreaders don't matter. 1600mhz is fine. 2000mhz+ won't give you even .1% more fps. Pointless to overspend. Look for something that advertises ""xmp profile"" (extreme memory profile). You want two 8gb sticks which will usually come as a pair. Case: $70-120. Find something you think is pretty. Read reviews. Mid tower case. Fans: buy a few. If you want your computer to be quieter, I really like the cougar vortex fans. You want more fans blowing into the computer than blowing out. (This helps cut down on dust inside the PC, as well as airflow) You can spend more if you want but those are found for around $15 each. Cooler for cpu+ thermal compound: $100. Power supply: for a build like this, a 600-750 watt is much more than enough, and leaves room for upgrades. A decent one is usually 60-70ish. There's wiggle room in those parts, but this would be a very high end build. You could save a couple hundred by buying a gtx 970 video card if you want...or an i5 CPU...but meh. Not worth the performance loss, especially in dx12 games which are coming. But this build should be easily accomplished, with a 144hz gaming monitor, and gaming mouse and keyboard...all within your budget. To buy something like this from Dell...most likely thousands more",0.042,0.829,0.128,0.9884,1

1463332842,2016-05-15,"Hello, I kinda had a problem like this a while ago, and it took me quite some time to determine what was going on, which, as it turns out, wasn't related to Steam or CSGO. Despite what others have said, for me it *was* a hardware (or firmware) issue. Anyway, here's what I figured out... I run a Wifi setup because where I'm located I am not physically close to my router for LAN. My problem was similar to yours in so much that attempting to download updates would either corrupt the game, or end up with saying the download was corrupt. In any case, it turned out to be my primary WLAN card. To fix the situation, I swapped over to my secondary WLAN card and, go figure, update downloads started working just fine again with no corruptions of any kind. Not entirely sure what the issue is, considering the primary card works just fine for every other application, but this is the root of the problem, so changing up your cards is your best bet. If you don't have more than one, or if you use LAN vs WLAN, here's what I'd suggest you do... For WLAN setup: * First off, try using LAN over WLAN if feasible. If not, keep reading... * Change to a different wireless card. If you don't have one, buy another cheap one from Amazon. [This] (http://www.amazon.com/Panda-Wireless-PAU06-300Mbps-Adapter/dp/B00JDVRCI0/ref=sr_1_6?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463330990&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=usb+wireless+adapter) USB wireless adapter works just fine. I don't recommend things I haven't used myself. * With the two cards installed (once you have two), make sure you are using the new one. * Go to Control Panel &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt; Change Adapter Settings &gt; Right click on the OLD adapter &gt; Disable &gt; Now make sure you can connect with the new adapter &gt; Restart Steam and try downloading updates again For LAN setup (physical cable from router to PC): * Given that most computer only have one ethernet port, you options are limited. * Try wireless like above, recommendation on wireless adapter still stands. * Try a USB ethernet adapter. In this case, [this] (http://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Ethernet-Network-Adapter-Chromebook/dp/B00484IEJS?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00) one should do just fine. I use it for my Chromebook in areas with only LAN access. * With the USB adapter installed, make sure you are using it. * Go to Control Panel &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt; Change Adapter Settings &gt; Right click your built in LAN port &gt; Disable &gt; Now make sure you can connect with the new adapter &gt; Restart Steam and try downloading updates again If none of that works, the only other option I'd suggest to you that I didn't see listed here already is changing your download region in Steam. * Go to Steam &gt; Settings &gt; Download &gt; Download Region &gt; Change this to any region WELL AWAY from your current one, which is typically the one closest to you. * After change, restart Steam and try downloads again. The region change did not work for me, but did for many others, so that's the only reason why I mention it. In any case good luck!",0.048,0.874,0.077,0.9555,1

However, as macs become more and more prevalent (no one near pc, but still) especially among higher-income families, ones where younger generations tend to be more avid gamers, game companies have started to make games for mac. However, they'll usually make them...and then just completely abandon them. While I definitely agree that mac users have to accept some level of apathy from game companies, games that ""support"" mac should also truly support it - just because I can play a game on mac doesn't mean it'll be even close to as well designed as it's PC version. They seem to just completely ignore the alternate keyboard+shortcuts that mac users have, and provide little to no optimization. I have a friend who has a PC about 2x as powerful as my mac. In TF2, when I'm running an insane performance config that makes the game's graphics envy atari graphics, and I still get less than 1/3 the frames that he does (with no performance config). I also get much less stability. The game came out onto mac 6 years ago - this is ridiculous how little support valve gives to it. CS:GO is actually remarkably well optimized for mac, but is still missing a few key things. Opening itself into a separate desktop would be amazing, mac keyboard shortcut support and there's a weird glitch with the cursor and the steam overlay. Those 3 things would make the game such a pleasanter experience, and for a game that often banks on the fact that it's one of the few major shooters with as good mac support as it has (relatively).",0.091,0.697,0.212,0.9915,3

Just because it's physically possible to open the application doesn't mean it's a successful or good port.

On top of that, the biggest factor in determining game speed is GPU and CPU (CPU less so, but in some titles it does make a significant difference, TF2 being one of those). C) Most of my complaints are not with performance (aside from TF2, that is inexcusable). They're about keyboard shortcuts, how the windows work, cursor issues, remapping keys, function keys...Can you imagine if a game company came out with a game that on windows 1) Wouldn't let you exit the game while it was running (no matter what you tried) 2) Had issues with mapping stuff to the alt/ctrl keys 3) Had a broken cursor 4) Didn't support some of the keys on your keyboard (at all) 5) Had almost no synergy with gaming softwares.

1464976018,2016-06-03,"For me there are a few qualities that indicate a good player: * Game sense * Aim * Spray control (sort of aim, but whatever) * Movement * Knowledge * Communication Game sense requires you to just play the game seriously for quite a long time, but most people pick it up. The other things are quite easy to practice. * For **aim** there are a lot of nice maps you can play, one of my favourites is https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=213240871. There are some with bots you shoot instead of circles, those also help (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=368026786). Play these and take deliberate shots. Also team death matches, but when you play them try for one taps (try make 100% of your shots head shots). Trying to one tap the whole time will mean you don't frag as well in the tdms, but that's not important. * For **spray control** you literally just shoot a wall and practice your spray control (I think you can also do this in the first aim training map I linked). In game it's a bit different, but the muscle memory helps quite a lot. * Movement is quite tough to learn: it's all about peeking, strafing and some other shenanigans. Playing aim 1v1's helps with this (you get a lot of 1v1 duels in pretty dynamic arenas). * **Knowledge**, again quite easy to pick up but quite tedious (I wouldn't worry about it till you're a bit better). But when you do get better your team will be upset if you don't know smokes... Watching pro games (with commentators) helps a lot with this. You can pick up on good places to cover certain areas, smokes, nades and broad idea of what you should be doing. * **Good game sense** is about knowing where to be looking, where to be moving, where the enemy is most likely to be and other general good things, this will just come with time (from playing matchmaking seriously). * **Communication** is about listening to your team and telling them what's going on. You will need to know the names of all the places on all the maps, it is massively helpful (but it's really easy to pick up from watching pro's play with commentators or just matchmaking games). But the most key thing to getting good is to play seriously with serious people, it might suck sometimes being told you're a shitter and stuff but people often do give genuinely good advice (under a veil of douchebaggery). Playing with people that are better than you is good, they will point out what you've done wrong; listening to them is key. Even if some one is worse than you they might be right about something, so always consider what people say (but don't take the insults personally). In my humble opinion casual games are quite bad for learning, no one is serious and you don't get a good sense of good play. Sorry it's a bit wordy, and as a disclaimer this is just what I have found through playing and teaching friends. Also playing seriously doesn't mean you can't have fun, you can still have a laugh flashing your mates or yoloing through smoke with a swag 7; but if you are going to try make it work. With regards to the type of guns you use, they all have different play styles. For beginners SMG's are often easier, but they only work in certain situations. Rifles are very versatile but slightly harder to use (by far the most important gun to master in my opinion). Sniper rifles can be game changing, but only if used well and in the correct places; if they are used badly it's just a disaster (Also, being a good awper requires pretty good game sense and communication).

[Say it witcha chest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUmtvoJKsbQ), [little ass nigga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CEUJqjbMrE)! But seriously, I get that. I have to fight the instinct to completely ignore the guys on the server that are softer spoken. And I think they tend to listen to me more often than not, also as a matter of instinct. If you find that they're not listening to you trying to command them, then just try focusing on providing better information to them. It may up your leadership credibility with them over time -- although a PUG game may not be long enough for that -- but if nothing else, it will improve your team's chances of success just by having more accurate information spread across the team. CSS and CSGO are a lot faster paced than most games, but highly competitive play requires a lot more knowledge about your teammates your opponents' positioning than many would guess. It's a brilliant game in that sense. &gt;Then my early onset of dementia kicks in. God so many grenades that kill teammates, so many times shooting down teammates after being flashed and cannot figure out who someone is. My problem is that due to having large hands and generally not having the same twitch reflexes that I used to have, I would often accidentally tap ""C"" or another hotkey, or hit ""4"" for grenades instead of ""3"" for knife. So I bought a great $10 mouse on Amazon that includes two side buttons, and binded them as ""Primary Weapon"" and ""Secondary Weapon,"" and then remapped the built-in radio calls for I / O / P instead of Z / X / C. I don't know what to tell you about friendly fire, other than to work on dinking a couple of shots instead of spraying, and to focus on getting angles around your teammates before the confrontation, instead of during the firefight. So, if Players 1, 2, and 4 are heading down the left side, try flanking to the right or jumping onto a nearby crate or box for a better angle. &gt;BTW i always am told to look at the radar, however how can you when you are trying to focus on your bad aim which requires looking at center of screen? Don't commit first, or at least don't commit completely to the fight. Like I said (Example 3), dink them once or twice and then withdraw.

All skins have an inherent intrinsic value of at least $2.50 USD. That is the cost of the key to unlock the crate. 2. (and this was addressed in the Florida lawsuit) Unlike casino chips, Valve takes 15% of the total value of each skin trade. *The question becomes, who determines the value of the skin being traded?* 3. Answer: Part of that is Valve themselves, by determining the rate at which a certain skin is ""dropped"" (My words) to the player, and the other half is by way of OPSkins, the only site that I know of that allows players to cash out skins for physical money, and all of this is being governed by supply and demand. Basically how it supposed to work on paper is that OPSkins is supposed to act like a virtual store front for weapon skins, where prices are governed by supply and demand (but really it is collusion with Valve). However, Valve allowed third party gambling sites (highly illegal in the US) to take a massive root in the CSGO culture. Valve isn't doing anything because they take a 15% cut off the top of any trade (read: bet). What Valve created is highly illegal and needs to shut it down.",0.084,0.843,0.073,-0.5563,1

1468536584,2016-07-14,"It doesn't really have to go, there just needs to be structure. If the main problem is kids throwing away money because they're not old enough to comprehend gambling, then require proof of age. If regular online gambling can exist, then betting on esports matches should too. And it does, League and Starcraft betting are But it's really not that simple and you're not going to like the answer. CS:GO shouldn't have gambling of any kind because Valve created a retarded system where in game items are worth stupid high values for no reason. It creates many problems directly and indirectly involved with gambling services supporting CS:GO and because of its existence, there's so many ways around legislation and so many ways that less moral people can use to manipulate the player base for monetary gain. Players (especially the children) are already introduced to money pits when they see their first dragon lore. They wanna buy keys to get some skins, but now they wanna trade on the market, but now they wanna make a living off CSGO skins because of its absolutely ridiculous item system has already poisoned them with the desire to take monetary risks, and now they're not just low-high-ing on the market, they're gonna go risk money en masse with gambling. That progression right there is the cause of many legal problems involving gambling. You see, there's always been a gray area and culture wide moral dilemma with gambling because of influences like these. Casinos won't take your CSGO skins, cash only, because if that ever became a thing, it'd be banned, but they can still construct massive and aesthetic buildings and pump the freshest fucking oxygen mother nature has ever farted out her asshole to mess with your brain, get you to feel awake and excited and confident and jazzed the fuck up to blow some cash, but who the fuck is going to legislate against outstanding architecture and high quality oxygen? Nobody. CSGO betting unfortunately is clear as day not ok. There is no significant gray area. The items shouldn't be worth much of anything, they should just be tiered values for how unique they are, like every other game. Dota2 is lucky it isnt caught up in this drama but its probably because kids dont understand MOBAs as well as point and shoot. Valve's obsession with creating micro economies with in game items is fucking stupid and thats why you cant have gambling in CSGO. The conversion rates are terrible anyway, anybody who thinks its efficient to bet CSGO skins and then cash out shouldnt be gambling to begin with. When you gamble on league or starcraft, you're legitimately betting on which team will win or lose with straight and pure cash. When you gamble on CSGO, you can just use in game items (that are astronomically overpriced and overhyped), not only creating an array of value issues when trying to translate item value to steam currency to real currency, but you also allow kids to partake in something they are by law forbidden to do. It's morally wrong to let kids gamble because they are so easily taken advantage of, and in many ways. The big explosion in this lawsuit mess was mainly 2 youtubers who 100% lied and manipulated their viewer base for profit. And if they were just manipulating adults, thats scumbag level. And if they were manipulating 14 year olds gambling with their unaware parents' cash, which they were, they set an incredibly new low in scumbag level, which they did. There's not enough separation between these overpriced items, the age of the participant, and gambling services for CSGO gambling to exist. TL;DR: It was Valves fault from the beginning anyway, they deserve to get sued.

The best thing to do is practice, and watch the good players when you are dead. Watch how they move, how they aim and shoot. Especially listen to your surroundings. If you hear footsteps and know it's not your teammate, you know where the enemy is already - this gives you a big advantage over those who are unaware of where you are. Make sure you are playing with a headset. It is crucial, really, as you will beable to hear all around you which is essential for a game like CSGO. Look at your minimap often to see where your teammates are as well as any spotted enemies. Hold tab on your keyboard to check exactly where each player is, but do this when you are in cover or you could get shot. Practice makes perfect. Don't play all the time with a P90, try to use weapons like the AK-47 to really get better at the game. There are many videos you could watch on youtube to get better. Good luck, hope this helps.

One key thing is to use voice chat- but not to overuse it. Make calls quickly and concisely (if it's a short call, you *may* want to call it twice just to be sure it was heard) but beyond that, limit your use of voice as much as possible. If you need to have a conversation, use text chat. Voice should be for calls only, as overusing it can be distracting to your teammates and you could be drowning out important calls. When one player is left alive in a ""clutch"" situation, best practice is to keep comms entirely silent unless absolutely necessary. . You should also work on getting a basic understanding of the layouts of the more popular maps, so you can understand the calls your teammates are making and so you can make effective calls to your teammates. Don't worry about the less popular ones until later. I've met people on the less popular maps with ranks as high as MGE who have never played some maps in comp and have no idea how to play them. .

But if you think about it -- at least some of the time, the end result for both of us is going to look the same *on screen* at least *some* of the time. So, I may have my crosshair a little too far out to handle a peak, and then twitch and it'll go even farther out, then snap back when I realize it. Or it may be a little low, or a little high. So like I said, it's inevitably going to look similarly ""suspicious"" at least once in a while. Probably not often enough to get you tagged as a cheater though. I think you're not entirely correct in your comparison between CS:GO and other team games, particularly physical sports. But I agree that I'm not perfectly correct either. It's about the odds on this one. So for example in football, often times a referee will miss a call or make a bad call based on his point of view. Maybe over whether or not a player was in-bounds or out of bounds, or maybe if a receiver had possession or not. Instant replay has remedied that to a certain degree, but it still happens. In CS:GO, you don't always have a suitable angle or all of the information, both including communication between players (and coach) or in angles on plays. And you certainly don't get all of the time in complex sports, especially in football. But more to the heart of my point -- as I mentioned, sometimes I'll get an asshole teammate that has something negative to say about my aim if he catches my weird twitch movement. If the Overwatch reviewer sees the movement, then sees me get a headshot, he might be suspect. If he also hears my teammate say, ""scar, what the hell was that? Do you have aimbot?"", then he may consciously or subconsciously start to look for that suspicious movement on my shots. I mean, the Overwatch reviewer just heard the top fragger on my team all but accuse me of cheating, certainly there is a possibility that I've been cheating all along and the Overwatch viewer is only seeing a couple of rounds of action. And so he or she would key in on that type of movement, and then you end up with some sort of [expectancy error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect) or [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias). So then the viewer is looking for that movement, sees it again, and boom. Caught me!

Moving: that is pure practice, you should be able to know the lines of sight, move while scoped without hitting corners, moving backwards still having control of situation. Shooting: mind work is over, we're moving to mechanical part of that; theres no optimal way like ""learn to aim like Shox in 12 hrs"", nothing like that. Theres bunch of web resources with pro configs and all that kind of stuff, u can bear one of them and fit it for you (keybinds, crosshair, sens). Take whatever you like at that current moment. Theres no secrets in keybindings, crosshair or resolution, all bullshit, take whatever you want. Just be a little careful about sens.

There are few perks to playing continuously, such as exp that gets nothing more than a new badge on your avatar's shoulder. Good news, you won't feel awful about quitting. Bad news, you might feel futility in collecting an artistic arsenal. (You can trade and buy keys at a chance for fancy items, they also come free with exp leveling) You also get to know other players, which can be fun, or annoying. The game changes as upgrades are made, if you get comfortable with sounds, maps, skins, game physics, or other aspects of play that is all subject to change. There are some cheaters, more than you might find in console gamer pools. Competitive play can be another aspect of reward, deficits are that you're likely to be outclassed by players if you don't know maps or physics of gameplay. You play with people who are available to play, there's no reliable filtering for international playing, so if you're wanting to play with people who only speak Russian, you won't have the greatest of luck.

You can only get the collections portions of the skins from drops, and even some of those are restricted to times when an operation is live. The ones that are from cases needs to be opened with $2.49 keys. However, I don't recommend opening them. If your interested in obtaining good skins for little to no cost then I can tell you how I obtained a profit of over $150 if you would like to know.

1481820604,2016-12-15,"Welcome to the CS:GO community! First off, I would like to say that the majority of the learning that needs to be done will come from just playing as much as possible. I too came from CS:S, and had a pretty difficult time transitioning honestly. I went from 1.6 to CS:S, and it was cake. Going from Source to GO was pretty rough. Practicing on FFA DM servers will definitely help you learn spray control and distance as well. Playing casual will help you learn the maps, but generally, casual servers love to just rotate between Dust2, Cache and Mirage for some reason. I would probably aim more towards community servers that may be happening to play maps that you haven't frequented yet. You mentioned playing CS:S for 8 years. Did you get into the competitive scene? Meaning, did you play through ESEA, CAL or TWL? If you have competitive experience in CS:S, you will just need to learn the peek spots, plant/post-plant positions, spam spots, common hiding spots in the newly designed maps honestly. Map knowledge is key in the game, but of course you will have to refine your shot again. Took me some time to refine my shot, but I know the maps pretty well so it all came together eventually!

1481936479,2016-12-17,"No problem - Happy to share an opinion! That attitude alone goes a long way, but I'd recommend actually taking a few minutes to learn as much as you can about the game. Maybe try for a couple rounds, not even to really get it down, but just to help facilitate a better understanding of how it works and why some things are so impressive or meaningful in-game. Playing isn't really necessary, as you can learn a lot about the game just by watching matches, but it'd be a nice supplementary experience. By learning about the game, how movement works, what the goals are in the game, how the maps differ, how the different weapons operate, the economical component to competitive play, the strategic decision-making and play-calling at the professional level, (etc.) you can better appreciate watching your son play, or his team's performance (for better or worse) at a LAN tourny or online league playoffs. You'd be more emotionally invested in his performance, because you'd have a better idea of what he is doing during matches each round that is so awesome. If you've never played an FPS game, it may be odd to understand, but CS is beautiful in that the basic premise is pretty straight-forward. Anyway, if you can't or don't want to really get into how or what is exactly happening when his team plays, just be there for him to vent if his team is giving him shit (typically good people can get crabby and in heated arguments when things aren't going well), or give communicative advice in how he can respond to teammate conversations with various organizations, encourage him to be critical of his league matches both positionally, movement-wise, communication with teammates, spray patterns, patience, clutch ability, trading reactivity, nade usage, confidence, and remember always have fun, even when things are stressful. Playing a game for hours on end can be taxing on the eyes. Once an opthamologist recommended to me to utilize the 20/20/20 rule, meaning every 20 minutes, look at an object 20 feet or more away for 20 seconds. It'll save some eye strain, dry eyes from not blinking as much, or headaches. Just try to understand what he is trying to achieve to appreciate his successes and to some extent hurt from the tough losses. The game is back and forth with successful force-buys or half-buys more common than ever in GO. Do what you always do to keep morale high and motivated to improve, and that it's always fun. If the dudes he is playing with aren't nice people, that can wear on a person over time in stressful high-stakes matches. Making a mistake in over-time of a playoff match or LAN quarter-final can be a lot of pressure, to learning to handle that stress is important to succeeding. I'm telling you, there are few things as satisfying in the world than clutching a 1v3 situation by isolating angles and having great crosshair placement, as you teammates celebrate with you in the background. It's a damn great feeling, similar to scoring a nice goal in a soccer game, or sticking a landing from a high bar routine dismount in gymnastics. Thousands of hours of practice paying off (e.g. in a big comeback win 16-14) is always a wonderful sensation of accomplishment or achievement for the good ole' brain. It's awesome to be above average at something, and it's great anytime in life you can turn a hobby into a (paid) profession. Also, and I don't have any empirical data to support this, I'd recommend having him exercise regularly in some capacity. Doesn't have to be weight lifting or running. Could be swimming, or biking, or bouldering, or body-weight fitness, or soccer, or flag football, or basketball, or hockey. Just something he genuinely and honestly finds fun. I say this because exercising your body strengthens the mind, both physiologically (neural pathways) and mentally. It's just good for ya in many ways, but I think it could positively impact quickness/reaction time/flexibility or efficiency of thought, as well as overall mental health.",0.068,0.662,0.27,0.9996,1

1484757682,2017-01-18,"I think it's easy for some to assume voice-chat is simply faster just because ""it just is"". Radio commands can to be more effective because that information has a much smaller memory footprint and travels across the server way faster. A concise string of words with familiar sound-byte. No need for silly slangs and other nonsense. I recognize a radio command immediately through familiarity and know exactly what it means in less than a second rather than listen to someone annunciate more than 10 words in a few more seconds. Radio command in a rapid keystroke says what happened and highlights location in green in 5 words minimum. I honestly think this feature would be far more popular if valve set it up better where the location of messages appear in the middle of the HUD and expand it with another section of commands.

However, if this is your only option you might need to go for the lowest settings in order to increase your FPS as frames are key. Other than that you will quickly realise that csgo is not the type of game where you can land your crosshair on an enemy and just spray. This will only result in a few hits and might tag enemies for about 20-30 HP depending on your weapon, you might land lucky headshots sometimes but more than anything you will miss the enemy. Try using a variety of weapons and try to understand the recoil pattern. It will be hard at first you will get your ass handed to you but always remember practice makes perfect. It took me 2-3 months to get comfortable with the AK-47, I've been playing csgo since 2014 and now I can one tap often. Try bots first and download some aim maps to help you learn one tapping with the assault rifles. Watching YouTubers will get you nowhere regarding aiming and actually learning how to use weapons, however you should definitely watch videos which talk about smoke spots on your favourite maps and other types of equipment.

If you pull up the scoreboard and see you all have 2000-3500 dollars call for a save. Learn a few simple starts at first like split a or Lower mid b on dust 2 for example. Play style should always be reactive on ct and smart aggression on t. By reactive I mean follow the bomb and based on information from teammates and sound figure out what site they will be going to. Smart aggression I mean open up sites the right way using smokes and flashes properly. Ask a teammate to flash you in. If you feel you have very great reactions. Be the entry fragger. If your good and flashing people in play support and trade if your entry goes down. If your a solid awp player play awp. If your a good lurk hang out in the middle of the map and stop the cts from rotating to the site t controls. If your just good at shooting the gun and running around be the rifle. Even though it may not seem like it these 5 positions are the key to success and it sounds like your playing a moba with guns.

1488952114,2017-03-08,"Here's some tips **Buying** * Number one rule of buying: everyone doing the wrong thing is better than some people doing the right thing * Losing multiple rounds in a row results in your team getting more money, capped at four losses. * The winners of the pistol round use the multipliers on shotguns/smgs to build up a bank for the full buy rounds. The losers of the pistol round buy p250s and try to get picks to decrease the size of the bank. The winner of round one should win the first three rounds. * Full buys start round four. Full buys mean head armor, ak/m4, and smokes/kits. CTs aim for their economy to survive two losses in a row while still full buying. CTs can cheat a bit by not buying head armor, since aks and awps will kill if you in one shot to the head. **Callouts** * Google a pic of the callouts and put it up on your second monitor. If you don't have a monitor print them out * Call out the exact number of people you see or hear, and if you see the bomb. Nothing else **Shooting** * If a user is standing still firing a full clip without stopping will always produce the same spray pattern. Moving while shooting adds variance to where the bullets land. Some guns, like the AWP and auto, have a movement cooldown that requires you to stand still longer before shooting. The blur on the scope will show this. * When walking in one direction, pressing the opposite direction after releasing the first key will slow you down faster. That's why people strafing back and forth can make shots go straight. * Tapping, bursting, and spraying all produce different amounts of recoil that you have to pull down with to compensate for. The effect is gated by how far away the thing you are shooting at is. **Utility** * CTs should smoke entrances to sites, those places are more obvious. Smoking from T side usually involves trickier smokes, learning those can make the difference getting onto site. * Smokes toggle when they stop bouncing. Other grenades are based on timers. Use the timers to produce different effects: A Terrorist flashing off the door frame into B site on Cache will produce a longer blind if the CTs are looking straight at the door, but gives them more time to turn than bouncing it off the floor and turning. * Smokes put out incendiary grenades Watch streams, watch tutorials, keep your head up, it's a stressful game.",0.066,0.888,0.046,-0.8729,11

1489102109,2017-03-09,"Don't worry man. Personally, whenever I play a game I enjoy playing against people who are 100 times better than me as I learn a lot from it. In CS for example. I get my ass rekt over and over. Why? Why do I die? Was he stand somewhere I didn't check? Was he just quicker? Was his aim better? I subconsciously analyse every move they do, it's like my brain takes in everything and processes it. After getting rekt for the next few weeks I wake up one day and realise that I am improving without doing anything. I just think about how I can improve, can I peek better? Do I need to practise spray-control or just overall aiming? Do I need to use flashes etc more? You learn from your losses, don't forget that. Just because they are better don't give up. Never give up. Doesn't matter how good you are or bad. Doesn't matter how good they are. As long as you learn from the experience. Why do you keep dying? Are you peeking poorly? Are you aiming like a monkey? If you keep dying before you get to shoot the guy you need to practise peeking/shoulder-peeking. Maybe you need to use flashes more. My reaction time isn't the best. My spray-control is terrible. But to compensate I taught myself crosshair-placement and with the help of crosshair placement and preaim/prefire I managed to get to global. (Currently global on 4 accounts, now playing faceit only) Tl;dr: Don't give up because they are better, learn from your mistakes and improve what you can. Why you die is important. Think about why you died that round, could you have done something different? This is the key to improving. From bad to decent to good. If you can't get over anger, turn that anger into practise to be able to make your enemies feel the same. Depending on where you live I would gladly play with you and just have fun. No need to become a coach of some sort. Just someone to help you improve and have fun.",0.12,0.697,0.183,0.9736,1

1491401756,2017-04-05,"Smart cursor placement is probably the most important thing. Learning how to peak is probably the next. The idea is that you want to give your opponents as little amount of information about your location as possible. So things like walking instead of running, yield you silent footsteps. Here are things everyone can hear: &gt; * Jumping (some jumps while holding the walk key do not make a sound) &gt; * Running Footsteps &gt; * Reloading &gt; * Changing view level of scopes &gt; * Dropping guns on the ground (throwing to a friendly does not make noise) &gt; * Dropping the bomb on the ground (throwing to a friendly does not make noise) &gt; * Picking up the bomb and other equipment off the ground. &gt; * Throwing any grenade makes a sound on release, bounces, and then additionally on explosion. Popular to contrary belief your opponents can not hear you cycle your inventory. One of the best tactics to throw an enemy off is to run in one direction and then stop and immediately turn around and start walking in the opposite direction. they heard you run one way and think you're pushing slowly in that direction, you can usually catch them off guard if you're prepared for the encounter. the only other thing i would say is peeking. treat each corner like you're peeling it and keep your crosshair consistently in the next place an enemies head could possibly show up, that way if they do show up you have to move your cursor much less of a distance than they do. Use doors and windows as bottleneck killzones. These are where enemies will show up. If you're covering many angles, don't just look at one, keep moving and checking out every different angle you can see from your position, unless you're trying to hide and play for time to delay a defuse. If you're trying to keep a single angle, peaking is like moving back and forth around the corner at an angle that you can just barely see an exposed bottleneck where an opponent will be coming through, if you're able to see them during your peak, and then you move back, even if he did see you hes not sure if you were coming or going or if you're gonna peak again so you have the advantage in that you know hes out there exposed, and you do know when you're gonna peak. if he doesn't see you peak even better, you can get the drop on him easily while he's unaware of your presence. Play deathmatch for 30 minutes and rotate through all the weapons that you commonly use before every competitive match. Getting a feel in rapid combat for how the weapons handle and finding ones you like is going to help you alot. Most combat in competitive matches is very quick and accurate and won't leave you with much opportunity to hone your skills, you'll find yourself just dead watching team mates most of the time if you haven't practiced before queueing up. Watching professional competitive games will help you quite a bit as well, learning where to cover and seeing these tactics in action by someone who does them flawlessly will help you see what proper execution looks like. Pistol rounds, stay calm no matter how many shots are fired at you, and aim for the head. If your opponents bought armor hitting them in the chest with a pistol is not very effective. No head armor so most every head shot is lethal. You also need to have a headset with a microphone to play effectively. You can hear much more out of headphones than speakers and you need to be able to communicate efficiently. If you don't have one and still want to play learn the radio commands (z,x,c + 0-9) all give you access to different radio commands that will queue an audio alert for everyone on your team. Want a bot to stay at the start? Hit z + 4, those commands like ""hold your position"" and ""follow me"" the bots will actually follow sometimes, whether they follow them is determined by how often they have survived following your instructions in the past. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXwOvFoO7eyytD0MmigOsQXBh6Pg5jotc This series of videos is really helpful. Select the video for the map you want to learn, for each map it goes through strategies for each side, common angles that are held, smokes and flashes for each site and mid. And callouts for the entire map as well. Each video is immensely helpful, what I recommend is that you watch a video in full, and then play a match on the map you just watched. In addition to that, go to the workshop, find a mod that allows you to customize your crosshair. It's important to have a crosshair that you're comfortable with. Another thing I would recommend would be to search for a workshop map called recoil master. This will teach you the unique spray patterns that each weapon has, and has an indicator to follow to keep your shots on target as your spray through an entire clip. There are some aim training maps and reflex maps on the workshop as well. Basically anything you do to practice good CS habits and muscle memory is going to help you out. Last thing, try to avoid crouch spraying during encounters. The best thing to do is to strafe back and forth left and right(preferably behind full or partial cover) and fire shots during when your movement stops at the point you switch back heading the other direction. Your movement is technically 0 at that point so your shots are as accurate as if you were standing still, because technically you are, until you start moving in the other direction again. edit: added another advice post from the past. A couple more things, when you're reloading watch your bullet count, as soon as the number changes to a full count for the clip, cycle to your knife and back to your main weapon asap, just hit 3 and then 1 on the keyboard, or mousewheel down and backup(riskier than using numbers) and you will complete the animation for bringing your weapon back to a firing state faster than if you would have just let the reload animation complete. When you're awping, you do this trick after you fire a shot, and to clear you scope, why click your scope twice and make noise twice when you can switch to your knife and back which makes no noise. also if you fire and miss, switching to your knife immediately allows you to get back behind cover way faster. It's very common practice to cycle your weapon as soon as you fire an awp shot no matter what, that way you can get out of the exposed area more quickly while you're racking another round in the chamber. Also, if you're looking for someone to play with, I have dropped ranks quite a few into silver because I got a new job and haven't been playing often enough. Every time I go back to it I'm unranked, but I'll be playing more often since I just moved and got my desk setup. You can find me as Stormy on steam, the easiest way is to search for the group called legion of altana, I am the only stormy in that group.

1496763894,2017-06-06,"The AK47 is actually the best (arguably) weapon in the game. If you are doing low damage with it, it means your aim is off. Spend some time practicing Deathmatch. The mode you are in is ""Casual"" which is a terrible version of Competitive. Deathmatch uses no in game money and has spawns all over the map with no life limit. I would say, spend some time in Deathmatch using the AK47 and either the M4A4 or the M4A1S. You will get destroyed by anybody who knows how to aim, but that's what you're trying to learn. Also, spend some time playing offline with bots, but set the bots to ""No bots"". When you do this, pick a map and find a large flat wall. Give yourself an AK47 or M4 and shoot a hole in the wall for reference. Then look to your right and try to snap from wherever you look to put a shot on the hole. Try this looking right and left of the hole and try this while moving. Do this for a while. *If you are in a casual or competitive game mode which requires money to buy a weapon, you can can use ""cheats"" to give yourself what you need. Open up your options and under Gameplay, turn on the developer console. Then, in game, press the ""~"" key and type ""sv_cheats 1"". This will turn on cheats, but only works in offline games or private servers so you can't use this in matchmaking. Some of the commands you might want to use for practicing your shooting are: give weapon_ak47 - Gives you an AK47 | give weapon_m4a1_silencer - Gives you an M4A1S | give weapon_m4a1 - Gives you an M4A4 (I thought this was weapon_m4a4, but online it says m4a1? Can somebody confirm? I'm at work x.x) | give weapon_deagle - Gives you a Desert Eagle (really hard to use weapon, great for practice) | give weapon_flashbang - gives a flashbang | give weapon_molotov - gives a molotov (because fire) | give weapon_smokegrenade - gives a smoke grenade | mp_roundtime 60 - changes round time to 60 minutes | mp_buy_anywhere 1 | mp_buy_time 1000 | mp_maxmoney 50000 | mp_startmoney 50000 | sv_grenade_trajectory 1 - Shows you the trajectory of grenades so you can practice that. | sv_infinite_ammo 1 - infinite ammo with no reload | sv_showimpacts 1 - puts a small colored square where you bullet hits something | Any of these cheats that end with "" 1"" can be turned off by changing them to "" 0"". Most of these cheats will give you a good setup for practicing anything you want on your own server or offline. I know this was very long, but I hope it helps you set up a good practice server. You want to practice spray patterns (just stare at a wall and spray, then try it again and this time try to move the crosshair so the spray lands all the shots in one spot), grenade throws (good smokes, places you can throw good flashbangs. You may want to watch a tutorial on these. I recommend Warowl's tutorials, but there are others.), and practice landing your first 1-3 shots in the same place. Spend some time doing this then try it out in Deathmatch. You should get comfortable with the AK and the M4 because these are the backbone of Counterstrike. The AK is a 1 shot kill from any range to the head, but is slightly less accurate than the M4 which is a 2 shot kill. These are the best guns to learn, and keep in mind that your first shot is always accurate as long as you aren't moving.

1501877072,2017-08-04,"Hey man, nice audio quality on that vid (something I see lacking for VERY many smaller youtubers), the background music is at exactly the right volume, your voice is clearly understandable and very... British. Now on to some gameplay tips for ya. Try to separate where you're looking from where you're going. *Always* keep your crosshair where the next enemy is most likely to pop up and clear every single angle you can think of where people could be standing and waiting for you. While you move around, try to visualize an enemy actually popping up where you're looking and put your crosshair where his head would be. This makes it a lot easier for you to react when it actually does happen, since you will only need to stop and shoot, instead of stopping, flicking to him, correcting your aim and then shooting. This is what we call crosshair placement and it's quite literally something you can change from one moment to the next that will make you play lengths better than what you imagine to be capable of right now. By extension, if you always follow this rule, you will not be walking around corners using W anymore. You will be using A and D to go around corners, which will help you later on when you start learning sidestepping/stutterstepping, a slightly more advanced technique with which you can keep moving virtually without stopping at all, while still retaining the accuracy that you get from standing still. I see you stopping and tapshooting a lot in your video, which is, and let me make this clear, *an extremely powerful and useful habit to have*, since most people new to CS will just keep moving and try spraying at their enemies, which will generally lead to their early demise since spraying is a more complex mechanic in CS than in most other games. Every weapon (almost) has a so called ""spray pattern"" that is specific to the gun. This is basically the direction and intensity of recoil for every shot fired in full-auto mode. It will always be the same for a certain weapon, the only real unkown factor is the inaccuracy, which is exacerbated by movement and remedied by crouching (This does not mean you should crouch when you want to shoot, use the crouch key sparingly since it imparts a large mobility penalty). Now, if you want to try your hand at spraying (and trust me, you want to), google a bit(watch videos by [TheWarOwl](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheWarOwl) , get yourself a workshop map called [recoil master](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=english&amp;id=419404847) , or just open up a local game via ""play with bots"", set it to no bots, find a flat wall and start spraying at it, trying to figure out how to move your mouse to correct for the recoil with different weapons. An important element of the game that is generally appreciated for its relevance and power, but often overlooked in its depth and complexity, is *movement*. You can be a lot faster and more efficient in getting from point A to point B than you think in this game, and there are other benefits to be had, such as surprising your enemies by appearing somewhere they wouldn't have expected you or simply being extremely accurate while firing, in spite of staying in motion throughout an engagement. There are many resources to be found concerning this topic, just get on google and hit up the first three results (again, TheWarOwl is one of the best all-round tutorial/info type resources you'll ever find for CSGO). *Nades*. These are often overlooked by newer players since they tend to be intimidated by them or simply a) do not realize what an impact these can have or b) don't know how and when to use them. There are lots of set smokes, mollies and flashes you can throw (see [sothatwemaybefree](http://www.sothatwemaybefree.com) for a very extensive collection of those for the active duty maps), but the big thing there is learning to improvise with them. * Smoke grenades for example are primarily used to deny information to the enemy and prevent pushes, although they should be used cautiously for the latter function as many players will tend to push through them ever since Stewie2k first popularized this aggressive playstyle (before that, one could be reasonably certain that a smoked off hallway would not present any threat whatsoever). * HE grenades are, as their name already implies, mainly used to deal damage. Two grenades thrown shortly after one another at the same spot at the right time can completely shut down a rush and take 2+ players out of the round for a mere investment of 300$ per nade, or 600$ total. They also have a secondary function in that they produce a short-lived puff of dark smoke/debris, which can be used similarly to smoke grenades to cross certain areas without being seen. protip: throw two of these down banana on ct side inferno on the first round, about 1-3 seconds after you arrive there. * Flashbangs are perhaps the most widely used utility in the whole game, and rightly so. With the correct timing, they will completely blind an enemy for 3+ seconds, enabling you to shoot them down without any return fire, or holding off rushes and buying yourself those valuable seconds that your teammates might need to rotate and help you out. * Molotovs/incendiary grenades are used to block off the movement of enemies or get them out of hard-to-reach corners where they may be holed up. If you suspect enemies coming down a narrow path or someone waiting behind a corner, throw one of these babies there and watch the enemies run for their lives or burn for massive amounts of damage. When used to get someone out of his position, *always* wait a bit before pushing on and aim where you expect them to come out, they will be easy pickings if you're prepared, but a deadly surprise when not. Side note: Molotovs and incendiary grenades can be extinguished with a smoke grenade, so if you absolutely must push through fire and have a spare smoke, throw it in the middle of the fire and just forget there was fire in the first place. Also be wary of enemy smokes popping in the molotovs you threw, there will often be players pushing through those. Go onto a private server and familiarize yourself with how nades fly and the different ways of throwing them (throw, underhand throw, running throw, backwards running throw, jumping throw, and jumpthrow script). Once you get the hang of how they behave while in flight, it will be a piece of cake to improvise a popflash or a round-altering molotov. As useless as the idea seems, watch pros play. Think about why they play in a certain position, why they react to the enemies' actions the way they do and what you would like to try incorporating into your own gameplay. Another important part: Watch yourself play. After a few matches (or after every match, if you're inclined to do so), download the demo of the match and just observe what you did. Try to analyze what you did wrong, what went well and what you should try to focus on the next game. Now, all of this applies to your individual performance. There is a huge aspect of communication and adapting to your teammates (and also just trusting them when they tell you to stick a defuse) which I have not yet touched on, yet this is equally important as ""getting gud"". Visualize what your teammates tell you. When your teammate on dust2 says ""2 out long"", don't just accept that, but rather think about how it affects what you were planning to do beforehand. Change the way you play depending on the entirety of information at your disposal. Equally, relay any information to your teammates, in more or less detail. Whether you should be detailed or not is something you will notice very quickly while actually playing, if there are a lot of calls being made and say ""3 on b, one awp, bomb"", but if it's generally silent, you can go into more detail on where exactly they are on B, which weapons they have and whether there are any smokes and molotovs that might hinder a retake. If you have non-communicative teammates, don't give up just yet. Analyze what they like to do or keep doing every round and think about how you can help them do that. Tell them you will throw a flash so they can enter into a certain area more easily, cover angles that they never look at etc. Another VERY important thing: It's more important to buy *with your team* than to be right. If you should be ecoing right now because your team is low on money, but your team decides to force buy, force with them. Only if they are completely out of sync with eachother or all keep force buying every round should you detach your economic decisions from your team. Talk about who buys what to prevent 5 AWPs on T side. If you're low on money while another teammate is raking in cash, ask them to drop you a weapon (and don't be afraid to tell them which one you'd like), and conversely, if your teammates are low and you have some dough to burn, drop your teammates some weapons, but not before announcing your intention to do so, since there are many situations where people are dropped two weapons and money is wasted. As I already said multiple times, there are many, **many** good resources to be found on getting better in csgo, some will focus more on individual skill, others on teamplay, and others again on strategy or tactics. Figure out what you're lacking in and try to improve on that. HF, GL, and don't forget: Don't be a loser, buy a defuser.",0.083,0.821,0.095,0.895,5

1503932600,2017-08-28,"Coming into this as a relative noob (100 hours - S1 almost S2) thought this may be helpful. 1) Headshots are great, but at early levels (S1 first rank of competitive matchmaking) not essential. My H/S% is around 20%. Just make sure at the very least you are spraying the body (shots on target are key). Upper body is great as it often drifts up &amp; you get a headshot. At S2 H/S%s are higher it seems which is what I am working on now. As a noob, try using the Galil &amp; Famas rifles initially (easier spray control &amp; cheaper to re-buy as you will die a lot) before moving onto the AK &amp; M4 (would recommend the M4A1-s initially as even though its a smaller clip it has easier spray control). 2) Watch grenade &amp; flash videos on Youtube for the maps you play. You don't need to learn them all, but a couple can really help. 3) Mics are great - but I don't have one (yet) &amp; have only a couple of complaints so far. Learn the map locations so you can make the right calls e.g. ""1 palace, 30HP"" - 1 enemy in palace, with 30HP left (e.g. you've shot them for 70). Everybody seems to do something similar. Also unless you can see the bomb don't call it. Your gamesense isn't good enough yet - you don't want your team rotating away from the Bomb. 4) Don't use Auto Buy - think about what your buying &amp; don't buy to the max. every round. (Something I'm only just getting my head around). E.g. as a noob - you will die lots &amp; have no/very little money to buy guns &amp; armour with, so you will die even more. 5) At S1 &amp; in Non Prime you will get toxic teams. It happens, probably happens in Prime as well (I'm rnk 18). Try &amp; learn something its just a waste of 40mins sometimes (I've lost &amp; won 16-0 it happens). 6) Play a couple of games on each map &amp; try to focus on playing well on one side of it (e.g. A or B site) - so you have less to think about &amp; learn &amp; you can focus on improving as a player. I am still getting used to both sides of Mirage (I mostly B but can play A), Inferno I can only really play A but am OK at B. Cache I can play A OK, but will play B if it comes to it. On Cobble nobody ever really seems to play A, so I play B (4/5 rds seem to be B). Now I am a bit more comfortable with the game, I play both sides more based on where I spawn (&amp; feel I have improved as a player). You run fastest with the knife out so at early levels you can often beat people to an angle by just being quick dependant on where you spawn. If you run from the furthest point away you often need to use a smoke or a flash to play yourself in as someone from the otherside will have already beaten you to the angle and will be lined up for an entry frag. 7) In Matchmaking - if you are playing on CT &amp; are at the site &amp; haven't seen the enemy or heard (!!! - use headphones!!!) them after 30-40 seconds, chances are they are going towards the other site. Ask a teamate &amp; look to rotate. Watch your back though as T teams will often run a 4*1 split (e.g. 4 goes 1 site, 1 goes the other as a distraction). 8) Good luck, have fun &amp; enjoy the game.",0.074,0.745,0.181,0.9975,2

1504710338,2017-09-06,"it's probably worth noting that most low novas are really just high silvers who got lucky. as the old saying goes, you can take the player out of silver but you can't take the silver out of the player. the phenomenon of teams ""doing better on T"" than CT comes down to the optimal play style for each side. T-side is more offensive and forgiving of a team that wants to rush (and oh lordy do silvers like to rush) whereas the CT side is defensive and punishes teams who rush (versus playing positions/sites and using good comms). so if it feels like your team is throwing changing from T to CT, they are, although likely unconsciously. they are not adapting their play style from an offensive one to a defensive one, continuing to rush, and getting punished. further to this, they are not recognising what is going on and continue to play the same agro style as CT. the losses mount, people get disheartened, get salty and get even sloppier - some just feeding the opponents kills and silently die. so if that's your guy on long on dust2 you'll find 4 t's on A site and they've just planted for the third round in a row and no one has said a damn thing... so the only thing you can do is put yourself in a position so you can make calls as early as possible. this might mean playing mid/cat on dust2 and calling ""2 short, looks like an a-split rotate to A!"" (esp. if your hypothetical guy at long is dead 24/7 at least you see their death and red dots on radar to give you info). similarly you can peek b, or again check what happens on the radar and make that call, ""2 B, bomb B, rotate!"". other things that are worth doing, include saying early ""we had/will have plenty of time to rush as T but we're CT now so let's play defensively!"" In addition to this there are some key grenades you can throw that are useful that also stop team members rushing (through bedroom, into tuns), esp. mollys. only throw grenades that advantage your team, but if they also happen to stop a team mate rushing to their inevitable death, then i'm all for them ;)",0.152,0.723,0.126,-0.972,2

Might want to see how you do in faceit and ESEA, being that your rank is 90% based on wins/losses and a bad team can screw you. As far as becoming professional, I dont really see that happening, you would basically need to quit your jobs/school and do full time practice. unless your are born with natural talent. If you enjoy the game, enjoy it, trying to make it a job can ruin it for you. After the new ranks from 2015 I was stuck at silver for 2 years, Finally after getting good teams i hit GN1, but am back to SEM. Yes aim is important, but teamwork is more so. If your aim suffers you can still use P90 and pre-spray till you start getting your aim back on point (aim maps help), also figure out what sorta of player you are and put that to your advantage (i am entry frag, my goal is to rush and try to get the first pick along with callouts to help my team, im usually first to die, but i also give my team the information needed to position themselves) And teamwork, is KEEEYYYYY, if its a new group (solo queue) keep chatter to callouts, use mic, have headset, dont abandon, dont even start a single match if you dont have at least 90min available to it without leaving. If you queue up and get used to each other you can be more open on the Mic. Callouts, this is key, yelling they are B into the Mic, will either get a full rotate or no rotate (good players hold off, bad ones rotate), You need to be exact and simple as possible, 2 pushed tunnels, onsite now. or i hear 2 in tunnels, is someone watching mid. Ive seen more screwups when too many teamates focus on same spot, which a panic callout will do, Headphones will let you narrow things down, if someones pushing you will hear, and you can usually hear the difference between 1, 2 , or three people pushing. While aim is needed ,60% i would say is strategy as even if your an aim god, it does you no good when you get killed from behind do to bad callouts, or bad positioning. And repeating the same mistakes over will just cost you (last night i ruined someone 7 times in a row on mirage, he would go ct to snipers, either pick or drop, I would come t -&gt; mid, throwing smoke to cut his view and rush connector, he would then run to connector but i would have the line out before him, every single time he would be at the same place, after he did it twice all i needed to do was pre-fire before he even became visible and he would walk into my spray. and it kept happening, basically he was giving us a free kill every round, and i doubt he was communicating to have someone help him)",0.13,0.787,0.083,-0.9877,2

1508339349,2017-10-18,"Basicaly, at lower levels, the gun gives you a significant advantage due to the damage, penetration and ability to follow up missed shots. An awp in most circumstances is superior *in the right hands* , which is why you see more pro's using the AWP instead of the auto, although it does get used. If an awper meets an auto, lets say they peek the same corner at the same time, if the awper hits him, he will likely kill him, but if he misses, he will likey die, because he cannot reload in time to get a second shot off before the auto gets his second shot off. To kill someone with the auto in one shot, you MUST hit him in the head, the AWP can 1 shot with a body shot. At lower levels: It dominates, at higher levels it most likely would have been better to buy an awp. The P90, and auto shotty are (or were?) similarly hated on for similar reasons. Newer players will do better with guns like the bison and p90, due to the fact they can move and shoot with relative accuracy, and they will not have developed the ability to stop and shoot correctly, spray control, trigger displine in the form of one taps, and accuracy, which are requirements for guns like the M4 and AK. So they can be compared to the auto similarly. If you're dying to guns like the auto and p90 a lot, it likley means you need an increase in skill. A challenge: If you think its just the guns that are making the enemy win, you should use them too to see if thats really the case. If you use them (the guns you hate) and you still lose... complaining that its unfair that *other* people use them, or calling these people names, is transparent and it shows that you have an issue. If the auto and p90 etc DO give you an unfair advantage, you should be using them all the time untill people learn to counter. But they do not give you an unfair advantage, and a better player would not have an issue with these guns being used. It is up to you to develop the skill and mental/emotional strength to work out how to win no matter the circumstances, least of all what gun is being used. Although practicing with the AK and M4 and AWP over the auto will, in the long run, be of more benifit than practicing with the auto and p90, it is ultimately your choice of how to play the game, and your responsibilty to deal with the enemy, no matter how he decides to play.",0.139,0.74,0.121,-0.9379,18

1509372655,2017-10-30,"Best way to progress in rank in this game is: Basicaly a ""good"" game happens when 1. No hackers or smurf 2. No trolls/derankers/retards on your team 3. The match is more or less even, not one team completly dominating the other. CSGO is incredibly fustrating because the times when all 3 criteria are met are few and far between. I have a solid team but the enemy team has a hacker No hackers but theres a retard on our team No hacker or smurfs and my team is solid, but now we're just dominating (possibly because of a deranker/troll/retard on the other team) Unfortnatly only 1 of the things on that list are within your control and that is your teamates. Once you have good teammates to play with, and you're playing to the best of your abilities, your rank will start to climb steadily due to the fact that you'll always habe good teamates, so 'good' games will only come down to hackers/smurfs on the other team which no game will ever be free of, even ESEA has cheaters. Best way to find good people to play with: 1. Play good 2. Add the players from your team and the enemy team who you think are good 3. Try to play with those people 4. Realize a large % of those players you added are going to leave/unfriend or you will want to unfriend/not play with them. But a small % of those players will be consistantly good and not horrible to get along with. 5. Rinse/repeat untill you have (this is key) !more than one! group of 5 players to play with at any given time. 6. Some % of those players you hand picked and have been playing with for a long while, will also leave/unfriend/not be able to play for whatever reason. So this proccess of playing and adding people needs to be pretty well constant. Even when I had a team together, there was occasionaly members that left or had other problems that ment that needed to be replaced. You will never be free of this, although the higher you go in rank and the more serious you get, the less you'll have to grind for people to play with, even the pro's have to take on new talent or git rid of old talent. I would go as far as to say In silver and nova finding good people to play with is even more important than winning, due to the fact that there needs to be a such a heavy heavy focus on this at lower levels. Now you can watch your rank skyrocket as you've cherry picked the best possible teammates that will play with you, eliminating as well as possible another variable that makes csgo fustrating. Hope this helps. Source: experience Edit: formatting",0.072,0.681,0.246,0.9986,2
1509381126,2017-10-30,"(Just as a disclamier this post isnt directed only at you and is for anyone else struggling with rank progression) Buddy, honestly, at silver you should focus only on 2 things. 1. Having fun despite the bullshit 2. Finding good teammates Thats it. Crosshair placement, studder step, strategy etc. Will all come just from playing. Last year I was DMG without ever looking up one video. THE biggest factor in your rank progression are the people you play with. Even more than your skill, you can be the skill of a GNM and be stuck in SEM just by the fact that your team sucks and cant re-frag, follow directions, or any of the other myriad of bullshit players do/don't do. It's a team game and there is only so much one person can do. (However you should still try to carry games that seem impossible just as an excercise to push yourself) What most people do is blame their rank on always getting shitty teammates, they are right by one way of looking at it, but they forget that: #yourteamisyourfault Thats right: It is YOUR choice to solo q. Therfore, it is YOUR fault if you lose a game due to your teammates being a few chromosomes short of real people. Just like how if you get blackout drunk and don't have total control over your actions, said actions are still your fault because YOU decided to get drunk. Hitting accept on a match is like saying yes to the question of ""do you accept you may be playing with a gaggle of handicaped nerds who are about to kick you at the end of the match even though you're carrying?"" Solo quing is saying yes to this question. So, It is YOUR responsibility to collect good teamates to play with. If you do not understand this, you simply will not progress. Now, there are always exceptions to the rule, there are some players who progress just fine through the ranks, even up to global. But the vast majority of players will get stuck in certian elo's if they only solo q, especialy at lower ranks due to the higher concentration of AIDS. So how do I find good teammates? What even makes a good teammate? 1. Skill 2. Compatibilty with your personality and schedule Some people get better with teamates who are more relaxed, who 'table talk' and joke around. Some play worse. Some people get better with constructive criticism (crosshair placement damnit!), some people hate being told what to do. Teammates who you get along with are totaly case-by case, and ontop of this your tastes will probably change over time. A teammate who you initialy liked, a year later, may be a diffrent story. You're really the only one who knows which teamates are compatible with your personality. The end goal is to have a (and this is KEY) few teams of 5 to play with while you progress in rank, eventualy playing mkre and more with one 'main' team so that you can pratice drills/executes and become more and more familar with eachother like Lebron and Kyrie. The actual process is fairly simple. 1. Play solo q 2. Cherry pick the best players from that match, from your team and the other team 3. Add them to friends list Rinse repeat 1-3 untill a good base of players have been built up. Keep in mind, a VERY large % of the players that you cherry pick, will for whatever reason need to be un-picked or will remove themselves (called turnover) For this reason, ESPECIALY at lower levels, you will need to be constantly looking for new talent. The more you progress, the less you'll have to find new players, but even the pro teams have some turnover, so you'll never totaly be free of this. Finding teamates you can trust will make progressing in rank a much much nicer experience. It will not totaly eliminate the bullshit. Even your own hand-picked teamates can have bad games, or go on tilt. Hackers and smurfs will always be a thing, even in ESEA. If you can have fun despite the bullshit, find the silver lining, and keep going, you'll do just fine.

I was playing in nova master to MG1( not the highest rank ik) and we had a guy on our team who had only 20 hours into the game and it was clear this was one of his first games he played yet he did not have amy sound because he wouldn't listen to us nor did he have a mic or use his keyboard to communicate so we kicked him by the 12th round because we were losing by 5 rounds and it was a close game and we won 16-14. It was not something that we wanted to do because we were once there but if your not gonna communicate or call out then a bot is better.

1513142241,2017-12-13,"Off the top of my head, I can't think of a way to do this. The main draw here is the dedicated C4 drop button. Switching to C4 and then pressing drop is two actions, taking twice as long, and is clumsier than just pressing a single drop C4 button. Sometimes you need to do it quickly. My custom binds are all about economy of motion; accessing actions as quickly as possible, avoiding displacing my fingers from the movement keys whenever possible. Single keys designated to each grenade type, mousewheel scroll up for knife, switch between primary and secondary with mouse thumb button, etc. Technically, you don't ever have to actually switch to the bomb. Just press and hold ""use"" while on the bomb site (and not looking at a gun) and you'll plant the bomb. This is also more efficient than switching to bomb and then holding left mouse. If you want, to preserve default binds as much as possible, you could do away with the useless bomb switch key, 5, and rebind it to drop the bomb as above. I've already rebound 5 to another action, and I like having bomb drop easily accessible with a twitch, on V (my movement cluster is shifted to the right already; ESDF).",0.065,0.76,0.175,0.9824,3
1513163533,2017-12-13,"Well, this is just a bomb drop bind. It works because there is only one single weapon in that slot. You could definitely do a ""drop pistol"" or ""drop primary"" bind, but there's really no point if you have your primary and secondary weapons easily accessible, as well as your drop key. I use `bind MOUSE4 ""invnextnongrenade""` to quickly switch between pistol and primary with my right thumb (defaults to primary when switching from something else; double tap for pistol in that case), and I've got drop bound to `q`, so it's really quick to drop weapons; two little twitches with non-movement fingers (I use ESDF instead of WASD, so `q` is left pinky) As for weapon drops, the quickest way to do that would be to have buy binds set up (or ""give"" in the case of cheats); press buy bind key, and then drop key.

You follow this process all the way until the opskins sales window, you will be asked to queue your item for sale to prove that it is marketable. You will be asked not to deposit the item on to the website, but you will get a trade request from a fake opskins account. This bot is operated by the scammers. OPskins never sends a request of any kind when you queue an item for sale. They only send a trade request once you have selected to deposit your skin and confirmed it. This is how they scam you out of your item, and then proceed to blame OPskins for the problem. If you need any more clarity or info on this scam please let me know and I will share.

Simply use it to familiarize yourself. My suggestion would be to also play Arms Race(similar to gun game on COD) this will help you learn the different weapons and help you discover how different the spray patterns are. You can also you this opportunity to adjust your settings in game to refine them to your specs. Also mess around with a cross hair customize from the workshop. Your cross hair can be your best friend or your worst friend. But once you are comfortable with your play style and approach with mouse and keyboard, I would then go to comp. Once you are in comp, initially don't worry about your rank and losses. YOU WILL lose, and probably a lot and that's okay. Just remember that in the end its just a game and the ranking system is still a mystery to many people. I know many people who should be at MG and are ranked in low SE.

On one hand, the CS series is my most played game with thousands of hours over the last 20 years so a lot of things come ""naturally"", on the other hand, having moved back from mainly console gaming to keyboard and mouse....things were not working out so good. So yeah, I'm the last one alive and my team all goes ""clutch or kick""...I just returned to the game and didn't even know what the heck they are talking about. Long story short, I killed them all with my trusted little USP and my team was so hyped up that we won a few more rounds after, lost the game though. ...but those are the moments why I still play this game.

It will screw you over more than not. - Use the number keys to switch weapons and not the scroll wheel. - If you can bother to learn, switch your scroll wheel to jump (scroll up and scroll down) and look up a bunny hopping video for a quick understanding.

It's a pretty good keyboard in general, I find myself only hitting multiple keys at a time when I am choking a clutch; meaning the keys are quite distinctive and far apart. The keyboard is very high quality, though it's small price in comparison to a lot of other mechanical keyboards. It does come with Kalih switches, though; Kalih switches are made by the same company that manufacture switches for your car. I believe if you can get your hands on some MX switches, you will be able to swap them with the Kalih switches if that's your preference. But, unlike many claims that Kalih switches feel cheap and wear out quickly, I would have to disagree with these claims and say they feel somewhat identical, if not better, than Cherry MX switches. Also, if you plan to travel a lot, this is probably one of the heaviest keyboards you might use. Everything that the keyboard does is located in the keyboard rather than software. For example, you control the RGB, Macros, LED Profiles, et cetera using the function keys on the keyboard. This keyboard has never failed me. It's always recognized when I've pushed a key and I believe it is somewhat water-resistant... Don't ask me, I'm not trying. If you're on a budget, this is a great mechanical keyboard and I would suggest it. If you're not on a budget this is still a great mechanical keyboard, but there are possibly other keyboards that are better.

I play with gold novas all the time on my LE main, and If we cant get 5 i play on my smurf. &gt; You cant really say it's a hardware issue either, 800x600, 50-60FPS average with drops to 20FPS, but I have seen people with worse setups than this playing 100x better than me. ...

Thats definitely fucking you up. &gt; But now I can understand why the whole cheating community exists; why struggle, if you can get it easier? Consider smurfing. Also many people do it because of: 1) Curiosity or general technical interest 2) Annoyed / frustrated with cheaters / better players (like you) 3) Trolling is fun 4) Losing is horrible for them (idk why) 5) Take the game too serious and think they might get pro / to impress friends (first VAC usually fixes that) There is a bunch more reasons, but yours is one that smurfing might get ""fixed"" in a sense to gain your confidence back.

Buying a CD copy for an Asian access is cheap and fluctuates from £3 - £4 (little over a key.) When purchasing from G2A you get the registration number and activate it on your new steam account whilst using a VPN. This enables its usage on Global servers (non-asian) by tricking the location that it's read from. I'm not really sure how vendors manage to attain so many CD keys of CS:GO and sell them for so cheap on G2A.

1528387390,2018-06-07,"1 + 3 refer to first shot accuracy and first shot precision, not your burst-clustering, which is 2. Accuracy is how close your cross hair is to their head when you click m1. This is all in your mouse hand. Precision is how close your bullet lands to the centre of your crosshair. This is all in your keyboard hand (counter-strafing, stutter-stepping, ADing). You are more precise, the lower your velocity is, you are most precise when you are stationary. Both, obviously, are necessary to get a 1-tap kill reliably. Basically, it doesn't matter how perfectly you line up your crosshair on their head if your first shot is more likely to land away from your crosshair than on it. If your first shot isn't precise, you're basically gambling that you hit them, no matter how sick the flick. I rate 2 above 3, since the majority of kills in cs:go, statistically, come from sprays, not 1-taps. All 3 are the fundamental necessary mechanical skills involved in CS gun-play, all are vital. E: obviously precision can be used to mean your clustering, ie your 'burst precision'; but the sense I'm using it in is 'how close your shot lands to where you were *actually* aiming' (the cross hair), as opposed to 'how close your first shot lands to where you were *wanting* to aim (the target).",0.065,0.91,0.025,-0.7219,3

A lot of people in game complain about the gay gun or the cod guns, claiming they are too easy to use etc. But the gay gun costs 5k and still requires some skill to use. Cod guns are a bit cheaper but once again, need even more bullets to kill with. Shotguns are the complete opposite. I rarely hear anyone complain about ppl using them (except the xm perhaps, it can be abit cheesey to see someone bhopping 25 metres away from you and get a flukey headshot, but this happens with the ak aswell). Unless you are point blank to your enemy, they are basically useless and you have to rely on a CT pushing you as a terrorist or as a CT, being able to get into position before an enemy pushes site. If these things dont happen, they are essentially useless and getting 900 dollars a kill is basically the only reason i use any of these weapons. I hear ppl complain about the pro 90, it is usually awpers as it is incredibly easy to get up close and take out 2 or 3 of these camping sluts in a single reload. I love it when they jump into pit on A long and i get in for a sneaky flank, 15k down the drain easy. the p90 is only an smg though and it is more expensive than alot of rifles in the game (rifled barrels and AP ammunition is usually what drives the price of a gun up), so it is warranted in being as good as it is. SMGs get a bad wrap in this game in general and are considered 'forcing' when you purchase one. The pro 90 is for the dedicated smg user who has a bit more money to spend. The awp- I do not have a problem with this gun, but i do have a problem with some ppl who use it, claiming it is the ultimate measure of skill in the game. People who use awps a lot are generally the people who criticise others for using pro 90s, cod guns or gay guns. These people feel they are the ultimate in this game and any time they get killed by one of the other mentioned guns, they are quick to point out how that person should uninstall the game and those guns should be nerfed as they degenerate gaming skill. Personally i think the AWP is a high risk, high reward weapon. it can work out well for you, depending on how the enemy comes at you and on what weapons they have, but if you find yourself in a bad situation and you lose it, don't get salty, learn to use a different gun, there is more to the game than the awp",0.196,0.735,0.069,-0.9975,3

Communication is of key importance in your rank so always make accurate callouts and try and guide your team and tell them what you think the enemies are doing. If you sense them rotating and your teammates are sitting holding angles like idiots, tell your team to rotate or at least try and get some information in a different position. Good luck, getting out of silver feels hard but once you do you will fly through Nova.

This not only makes you harder to hit, but also gives increased accuracy for the times you are standing still. Practice stopping on a dime, and making an accurate shot. Recoil -- Another thing somewhat unique to CS:GO are [recoil patterns](http://csgoskills.com/academy/spray-patterns/). They are memorizable, and so many people have the guns they use most frequently memorized. For example, with an M4A1-S the recoil patter goes straight up and to the right, so to counteract that, you move your mouse down and to the left during the spray. To avoid too much recoil, and when fighting at distance, try single shots, or small bursts. Watch some pro games to see how their crosshair moves when they shoot. Strategy -- There's way too much to put here, but know that counter-strike is not purely a run-n-gun game. Using grenades effectively can win games. Smokes are great, flashes are too if you're confident in your aiming and movement to get a pick on a blind guy. Some people use grenades to lure the enemy team to defend a site, and then go to the other site. Some teams will rush one site a lot, giving you a chance to rush through the other site and come from behind. Economy also plays a big part in game. If you're playing defuse games (most popular mode) you should be paying attention to your money. Look into videos on economy because it would make more sense. Some advice about economy that I can fit in here, is when trying to regain the economy lead, try certain things, like buying a good pistol and stealing an enemies weapon, asking for a buy from a teammate, buy head armour if you're Terrorist, and skip it if you're Counter-Terrorists up against AK47's and AWPS (they will always 1 shot to the head so not a big deal). Make sure you're using weapons the way they're intended, for example, rush with SMG's to get closer, medium distance for rifles, and medium to long for snipers. THE NUMBER ONE MISTAKE I SEE INEXPERIENCED PLAYERS MAKE: Making footsteps too loud. You need to know when you have time to walk somewhere, and when you need to run. Most of the time you can walk, and you should, because the enemy could be on the other side of a wall, and you just gave away your exact position. Sound queues save lives, and will get you called a wall hacker, so turn up that volume and get rid of the music (once you're comfortable with what you're doing ingame). THAT MEANS YOU YELLOW, STOP RUNNING NEXT TO ME WHILE I WALK AND GIVING AWAY MY POSITION! On another note, some people may find it hard to differentiate between one, two, or three people's footsteps. If you're teammate is running, you might be able to sneak in some run, or just letting off shift every few seconds, or alternate who runs and who walks, just do what comes natural. TL;DR Think of the game as a strategy game, do research on the base mechanics, and you'll be better off than 40% of the people you start with Watch some pro games to see what things should sorta look like, and **watch your own replays**!",0.084,0.795,0.121,0.9734,6

1533280666,2018-08-03,"TLDR at the bottom. Well this is a major UI update/release. And with every major release there is going to be issues, bugs, performance variations, and possibly have features which are taken out that were available in the old UI but isn’t present in the new UI. Also the new UI looks very ‘Metro-like’ in design and some people like myself don’t always prefer that look. Huge part of the reason why I hated Windows 8 soo much. The Panorama beta has being in place for a month or 2 so they had worked out some bugs... but think about it. The old Scaleform UI had multiple years of refinement and is pretty much bug free in its current state. Even if you take a look at this recent change log on Panorama there is A LOT of change activity that is going on. And this will ramp up exponentially now that the UI change is forced to the public. I’m not here to say that Scaleform is better BUT... there is no denying that Panorama is WAYYYYYY in its infancy and it’s gonna take some time to iron the stuff out to ensure: 1. The UI experience is smooth. 2. All bugs and glitches associated with the new design are squashed. 3. The UI experience compliments the gameplay and doesn’t detract from it. 4. The UI does everything Scaleform can currently do and have potential to do a lot more (I believe this is one of the driving factors for the redesign). 5. The new UI will work with the Source 2 engine (another key factor in the redesign and planning for the future). 6. The new design is more efficient in terms of its programming, therefor isn’t going to heavily effect low-end PC users. So bottom-line is that this launch option to opt-out of the UI is very important to folks like myself because for me I’m a lot more patient than others and I would rather jump on the Panorama UI much further down the track when a lot of the things mentioned here are sorted out. TL;DR Panorama is still in its infancy and and has a lot to work on. People like myself are more patient and willing to stick to the old UI longer so that when Valve does force people onto Panorama, the transition will be smoother because it’s had more time to be worked on. Some people don’t like to change over too early and have a bumpy experience cause things still needed working out. Hope this makes sense :)",0.034,0.854,0.112,0.9882,2

1540245878,2018-10-22,"THIS. The mute button is OP. I mute people all the fucking time for a lot less. Sometimes its thier voice, sometimes. It's something they said. Heck sometimes I have no idea why I felt I should mute someone, my instincts just told me I should. It's not personal I just need to concentrate, and some peoples voices, even if they are great players, even if they are calm and cordial, still distract me. Before I started playing it fast and loose with the mute, I would have shouting matches with randoms on the regular but then after, I felt like a pussy ""oh what you can't take a little critisim and you have to mute, what a pussy"" but I realized, (key) muting distracting people lets me keep as much mental energy on the game as possible. As soon as I have to explain something (especially in the middle of a round) mental energy is diverted. If I have to listen to a complaint, or sighing on the mic, mental energy is diverted. If I have to listen to a hackusation, mental energy diverted. If I have to listen to fighting on the mic, mental energy diverted. Be more liberal with the mute button. Learn to read the minimap and develop gamesense so your reliance on mic callouts is minimized. (bind f10 voice_enable 0 is a life saver especially at lower ranks) One thing I've learned is that, basically no one can take criticism. ESPECIALLY when emotions are high in the middle of a game. ESPECIALLY with randoms. Especially if you have to go into a long explaination or start an argument as to why something is better/worse. (like how you should stick together on a 2v1 CT side, not split up one to each site) (like how its not all that bad to buy an auto under certian circumstances) (like how you shouldn't put 3 people on A-site on dust 2 every round) (like how you want some form of mid control nearly every round on T-side on mirage)(like how everyone should really learn a few basic smokes for thier favorite maps) For the most part, giving advice/critisims to random players is like throwing pearls to the swine. It won't be appreciated and you should just save your breath. Mute and play on. On the flip side, there are a handful of things I have picked up and implemented directly from pointers in game or gentle ribbing. -&gt; you really sprayed his feet good op -&gt; you sure got a good aimlock on the ground, if we get attacked by midgets OP has us covered. These can serve as good reminders and are often absorbed much better as they have a positive tone. When I first started, I got the majority of tips from other players while I played. (Like the old 1.6 advice to spray at thier ankles!) I didn't reddit and I didn't YouTube pointers. Tips from more Experienced players was actualy one of the things that drew me into the game, the vets knew these secrets and I was getting the inside scoop how cool! Now that I've been playing a little longer, I do my own research and practice and have my own ideas about how to play the game. Now 6years deep, It is unlikely someone will show me something I don't already know or give me a novel pointer. For the most part I know what to do and must concentrate on doing it. But If you have to give advice, it's got to be short and it has to be *funny*. Otherwise it won't be absorbed and very likely you will just be ignored. Tl;Dr. Experiment with the mute button. I am team ""fast and loose mutes"" but because you are so new, you might want to play the mute game a little tighter. For giving advice: generally, make it funny and consise or just don't.

My key bits of advice would be: **Recognise how important sound is.** It's a game changer, and you'll instantly improve when you start paying attention to it. Don't listen to music or podcasts etc while playing competitive. **Learn angles.** Aim is important, and as guys like /u/furkitare suggested, DM is fantastic for grinding it: But the most important part to me of learning to get into more ''serious'' (Quotes obligatory, as we're all fucking noobs in the great scheme of this game anyway) side is learning positions, angles etc. This *will* come naturally, even when it feels like everyone else knows exactly where to stand etc all the time. You'll catch on quick. This carried me from Silver to LE. Who needs to twitch aim when you already have the crosshair in the right place for their head!? **Learn Grenades**. If you're getting into competitive, or not-deathmatch games, learning grenades will bump you up hugely in relation to your team and your rank. There's loads of amazing resources for them online, but learning 1 or 2 smokes for each map will make your life infinitely easier, and people will love you for it (even if they express it through Cyka Blyat) **Stop caring about K/D.** Your Kill to death is actually rather unimportant, while it's not *useless*, there's more important things. Play with your team, help *them* do as best as they can do (Enabling them through grenades, smart angles, good info!) and you'll get better off the back of it. Also will make yourself some friends. **Use a microphone**. This is pretty self explanatory, but the more you play, the more you'll learn just *how* important communication is in this game. There's various ''aim trainers'' that will help you get muscle memory in, i'd suggest googling those as i've not really used them, but they seem extremely popular - so there must be a reason. And finally: **Find some friends to play with**. CS:GO Pub is... Well look, it's shit. You'll get amazing games, and you'll meet amazing people, but you'll have a *lot* of headaches if your only way of playing is on your own. Easiest way to do this? Just add good players or nice players you meet in matches, group up with them for the next, etc. This community can be toxic, you gotta surround yourself with the cool ones.

1543584930,2018-11-30,"Surely. This goes without saying but good aim alone can help you get to dmg. Learn how to pre aim corners, that usually comes after hours of playing the game. Don't ever look at the ground and walk. Always keep your crosshair at a position where an enemy can walk out. Crosshair placement is one of the most key aspects of the game. Keep grinding it out playing some deathmatch and workshop maps like ybot prac arena where you could spend 10 mins getting used to your muscle memory. Another key tip every beginner needs to know : play with a low sensitivity. It hurts in the beginning and you'll suck but IT IS WORTH IT. Try reducing it to around 1.2 in game sensitivity with around 800 mouse dpi. It'll take you a week to get used to it by it helps you get way more precise and accurate. Learn more maps and don't stick to just dust2. You should know the basic few maps along with common angles that you could play as a ct. Learn how to communicate with your team. Give info that's useful. Don't just be like ""Ahhh help me b, they rushing"". Instead keep calm, tell them you see 3 coming towards b. Try and be accurate with the callouts. Also, be very patient. Patience can get you more kills than anything else. In lower ranks, people are in a hurry to finish the rounds quicker. But why not use the 1:45 thats given to you? Play the rounds slow, allow the opponents to make the mistakes and don't over rotate. The higher you go up, the more you'll realize that people tend to split up and play for map control rather than straight up rushing b. Please for the love of God, learn the basic smokes from each map (eg : ct, stairs, jungle, connector for mirage. Xbox for dust2. A cross, b ct smoke for cache). These smokes are what helps you execute better and get your chances of winning the round increase. Please don't play for frags. You can have 50 kills but it won't matter if the scoreline reads 14-16. Play for the team. Put the teams needs above yours. You may have the urgency to knife someone who's in a corner when you're 3v1. But I've seen rounds be lost that way. Be smart. Always check your corners no matter how sure you are the they won't be there. Now the final tip I can give you for now : it's just a game, do not forget to remember that. Cs go is a beautiful game and it is well known for its community that can rage in the split of a second. Always keep your cool even if you're losing 16-0. You're not a professional and you're not going to get paid for playing. So why lose your mental health over this game just becuase some other teammate of yours is playing the game on a gaming wheel instead of a mouse. Teammates are not something we can choose and always expect to get the most toxic ones if you solo q. If you're serious about ranking up, you would wanna befriend good players/teammates that you meet along the way. Try and incorporate their play style. Watch a lot of pro matches. You'll be surprised how much you can learn. Cheers and have fun mate.",0.092,0.721,0.187,0.996,1

1544852861,2018-12-15,"There are some things you are going to want to practice on a daily basis. 1.) Raw aim/flicks To train these, go to maps like ""Aim_botz"" and ""Training_aim_csgo2"" which you can find in the workshop. 15-30 minutes of playing on these maps should be enough, you will get better slowly over time. Focus on accuracy. On aim_botz you can shoot stationary targets or moving ones, whatever you feel like training. I personally feel as though there is little difference so I just shoot stationary targets. Videos on how to set up the maps: https://youtu.be/wWaTzSjE5i0 If you want, you can also practice ""tracking"" a Target by equipping a pistol, knife, or any weapon with high movement speed and just holding your crosshair on a bots head while you move. This skill will greatly improve your spray as well. 2.) Spray You will need to know how to spray to kill multiple targets. To learn your spray I would suggest these maps: ""Recoil Master"" and ""aim training v5d"" Video to watch: https://youtu.be/2ccJkM_1S8w 3.) Movement Movement is just as important as your aim. On aim_botz no clip out into the area where the bots are and try and get headshots while always moving. Practice stopping yourself right before you shoot by hitting the direction key opposite to the way you're moving. This is what many people call stutter stepping. If you're moving right, tap A to stop yourself, and then shoot. This should all happen extremely fast and fluidly. If you master this people will call you hacker for getting what appears to be ""running"" headshots. Extremely important skill, always practice this. If your shots are inaccurate because of your movement you will lose no matter how good your aim is. 4.) Positioning To understand how you should be positioning yourself you need to play deathmatch. To do this, go into the community servers browser and find a deathmatch server by typing ""FFA"" or ""DM"" into the search box. Pay attention to how other people are standing and how they are peeking at you, and how they are moving. I think it's more worthwhile to play on a server with more players as you get more gunfights in shorter amount of time. Don't get frustrated if you get spawnkilled that's just the nature of having 20 players on a map designed for 5v5. Your score doesn't matter here... Obviously. It's about building your skill. In DM, you will also be practicing your aim, movement, &amp; spray as well since you're shooting and moving. (Duh) I DM every day pretty much until I get bored, usually 35 minutes or so. No need to go overkill. 5.) Map Knowledge/Game Sense This sort of thing mostly comes with time but since you are a beginner I would try and just pick one map and try and master it first before you start playing everything. Pick a map, and look up videos on how to play every position on the map. When you are in a match and find yourself getting consistently wrecked by the other team, you might consider watching the demo (recording) of the match and paying close attention to what the other team is doing. To get better you just have to keep building reference experience, so play as much as you can and try and play the same positions over and over as well. Once you feel confident playing on one map, feel free to Branch out and learn the others. Avoid Nuke. 6.) Smokes Smokes are extremely helpful but as a beginner you really should not worry about smokes and focus on your aim and movement. If you want, there are lots of videos on YouTube that contain tons of smokes on all the maps. But pretty much just focus on blocking off where your enemy is going to come from, or using them to create cover for yourself. Eventually as you rank up you will need to learn a lot of the more complex ones. You will be disadvantaged heavily if you don't. But in silver / gold Nova most people don't know smokes either so again you should primarily focus on your movement and aim. That's it for the daily practice stuff, some general tips for new players is to just focus on what your team is trying to accomplish and help them do that. If you notice your teammates are all towards A, don't be an idiot and go off on your own on the other side of the map. If you're flanking from the opposite bomb site odds are extremely likely your team will either be dead or have won the round by the time you make it back to the bombsite in a stealthy manner. Stay close to your teammates and if they go down, immediately try and kill the person who killed them. This is called trading. Always watch your teammates backs if there is a potential for them to get flanked. Communication is absolutely essential in csgo so always be relaying information on where the enemy is and what you hear. Pay close attention to your sound. Don't play with music. If you hear someone reloading or jumping or moving or whatever it can give you a massive advantage. I don't know how many times I've gotten a kill just because the idiot on the other team decided to reload at a bad time. When you get to site, plant the bomb as soon as possible. Once you get the bomb planted, don't crowd around the bomb. Cover all of the entrances that the enemy could realistically come from. If the last enemy was last spotted at B site on Mirage for example and the bomb is ticking down there is almost a 0% chance he comes from ramp or palace, and even if he does there is an even smaller chance that he kills everyone and has the time to defuse. If you know an enemy is in a certain spot, use a flashbang to blind him before peeking. You can use a grenade to make him move out, or a Molotov. Try and have your crosshair pointed at where the enemy will likely be or come from. When you have the bomb down, quit moving around and giving your positions away with your footsteps. If the enemy CTs are retaking the site force them to have to clear as many angles as possible. They are in a time crunch and will probably just run into site trying to get kills, which gives you a massive advantage. You can flash before they get to you and your whole team can peek together, or you can get lucky and kill him as he's clearing another spot, etc. Etc. So do not give away your advantage by making noise at all costs. Buy with your team. Always play to win, never throw your life away. Play to stay alive. That's about all I can think of for now. Best of luck welcome to CS",0.111,0.776,0.113,-0.9159,1

1545734406,2018-12-25,"All right, well, it's been a while since I've told this story so pull up a chair. First of all, his name was actually JuanDiego Montoya, he played for DIAF (Die in a Fire) and FOH (Flowers of Happiness). He just showed up on the scene at a South California LAN that I worked at one day. I remember the first time this kid walked into the place. I say walked but I swear it kind of looked like he was floating on air. He was wearing this weirdass grey gui and sandals. His eyes looked like they were burning red but you could tell it was from no sleep and too much CRT. He didn't really 'talk' so much as he communicated through a series of facial expressions. Anyway, this kid walks over to the counter, buys an all-day pass, 4 bowls of kimchi, 4 cans of arizona ice tea, and looks directly at me and says (and I say 'says' but I swear he didn't actually use words) ""Valar Morghulis"". Well this was weird as fuck because only a week earlier, the local sponsor for the big $5,000 LAN we were hosting had pulled me aside and told me that a fucked up kid might show up and ask to register a 1-man team for the tournament. He told me that the kid would say the phrase ""Valar Morghulis"" and that I should register his 1-man team, despite our rules. The first game JD (as those of us who knew him call him) played was on de_inferno. He literally sat in spawn the entire T half and allowed the CTs to 14-0. On the 15th round, he bought for the first time: a desert eagle, a grenade, no armor. He then threw the grenade directly in front of himself and naded down to half hp, then typed ""Hello. My name is JuanDiego Montoya. You killed my brother. Prepare to die."" Next thing I know, this kid bunnyhops up T-ramp, up the ladder, quick deags two mid awpers, bunnyhops down to Mexico and gets two Banana pusher with one taps, and now with 2 rounds left, he shoots one off in the sky and starts yelling at the top of his lungs ""VALHALLLLLAAAAA"" and just runs straight up mid towards the last dude who is now trying to rotate through boiler. Now this last dude was actually one of the only known players to ever master the complete recoil pattern of the para. His name was Johnny R and one time we actually calculated that he could compensate for about 97% of the para recoil... and he had a para! Well JD pushed out of mid exactly as Johnny R pushed out of boiler, Johnny R quickswitches to para and starts letting out the sickest para spray I have ever seen, like 100% accuracy to JD's dome. And then, the incident. Few counter strike players know this, but back in 1.6, you could actually anti-recoil an opponent. Basically, if you could do a pixel perfect opposite movement of the recoil pattern your opponent was inputting, the game essentially ""blocked"" that specific bullet from registering. So as Johnny R is emptying the entire para clip at JD and hitting 100% recoil compensation accuracy, JD is hitting 100% anti-recoil. It was some crazy shit to watch. Then you hear Johnny R's ""click click click"" and JD quickswitches from knife (you need to have knife out to anti-recoil) to the desert eagle, and with the last bullet, he one taps Johnny R. Entire LAN is quiet for 7 full seconds. Count out to 7 right now... that's a long ass time. Then, before any of us have a chance to say anything, we realize that the round hasn't ended for some reason... behind JD, something spawned in Mexico. I can't tell you exactly what because all I could see was a bright white light on my screen... but I looked over to the JD's screen and his was the only one that actually showed this demon looking creature with a sceptre. JD needs to reload, demon is rushing at him, instead of bunny hopping away or going down with his knife, he starts to type out ""JAB JAB FORWARD JAB FIERCE"" in all caps into the console. Everyone's screens go black, flicker 5 times, and then light up again. JD was gone. The map was set to de_dust for some reason but in T spawn, beside a dead terrorist body, there was a chest. I looted it real quick and held onto it for years. Then, one day, I randomly thought about trying a CS GO operation key on the chest.

Its an emulated mouse acceleration, a gimmick they invented to sell ""high quality mice."" I would first remove all mouse acceleration from the computer, google &gt; mouse acceleration remover. 400 dpi is what you should set your mouse to and anyone telling you what input number in csgo is a moron. The sensitivity number should relate to your resolution you are using. And if you really want to be technical your FPS as well. Ok here is how you determine your sensitivity. Load up a solo map anything were you can mess around in without trolls killing you. Now find a spot with key positions such as dust 2 A bomb sight. Now face a typical direction and naturally flick to long a or ramp or cat walk. What part of your arm did you use? Was it the whole arm or just your wrist? There are two movements in aim. The arm which is going to be your around the corner aim, or the wrist, the flick shot and spray aim. You want to mess around in the sensitivity until your wrist movement only takes up 90 degrees of rotation meaning your wrist moment should represent your screens resolution. And your arm moment should be a full 360. Here are a few helpful videos that go into more detail https://youtu.be/wqZRpVz-u2Y n0thing https://youtu.be/ooAxzbGUCZA Rez Both are filled with quality knowledge. After you get your sensitivity down it's all about timing. Most shots should not be moving flicks they should be pre determined shots that have been set up. That's why flicks get such a big reaction, they are hard to do, and if you are flicking alot you are setting yourself up to fail. Something I always say: ""Aim small miss small"" https://youtu.be/L8FTbA38yuc A really really weird but accurate way to get insanely good aim is to stop looking at the aim ridicul all together and instead learn to bring the focus of the middle of the screen to what you are aiming at. Try removing your ridicul all together and use nothing. You will be surprised at how well you can still aim. It will show you how much your brain naturally lines up shots. Lastly over thinking is causing you to not hit shots. Just shoot once its 100% on the head. A good way to practice this is do a death match server and just place your aim on people's head and dont shoot. Once you have trolled them finally take your shot.

Seeing what CSGO turned into before it became ""Free to Play"" is the reason why I stopped spending money on the game entirely. The skins could've been more easily attainable to players who just enjoy putting the hours in, the Marketplace should not be a forced location to visit when you want to get new skins, you should've been able to find them more in game based on your ability and achievements, as well as just because earning shit it fun. Everyone has their reasons why they stop playing this game as it's ""updated"" and you have to wonder if there are other games out there more worth your time and energy? Some of the best games yet to come are about to open beta soon and all this raw user data people like yourself and the veteran users here at CSGO will be more than paid back once the new version of Counter Strike comes out once again.

This game was probably not trying to create a dark web in itself - but shit happens when you give kids access to this kind of ""entertainment"" so be critical of the games unlimited freedoms rather than the lack of scrutiny and security.

Don't shoot just track them. Next you most likely need to work on crosshair placement. Never stare at the ground since shooting your enemies feet is pointless. Try to aim at chest level at first and once you can consistently do that while running around; change to aiming for the head or upper neck. You can practice this by spawning in to a offline deathmatch against harmless bots. Enable console in settings, push the key (top left of keyboard underneath esc), type bot_stop 1 mp_roundtime 60 bot_kick all bot_add t four times if you are a CT or bot_add ct if you are a terrorist mp_restartgame 1 Now go around to different altitudes of the map like stairs and flat surfaces. At each four different, nearby, changes in elevation stand on one and type either bot_place ct if you are a terrorist or bot_place t if you are a CT. Practice keeping your crosshair at chest to head level on the bots as you move around. Now to practice shooting type bot_stop 0 and practice tap firing the bots to death and once you get decent at that start burst firing them with two bullets at a time. Once you can do two change to three than to four. If you can burst the bots effeciently now you can try to headshot. Aim for the head than shoot. It's really difficult at first but do it enough and it becomes a reflex. To practice try typing host_timescale .5 or lower which slows tome to half.

1548117284,2019-01-22,"Ok. As you're solo queueing, it's literally a crap shoot (no pun intended!) Used to be MGE but one of my friends inv a hacker so I got put down to N4 and only just worked back up to MG1 :/ Try to find where you go wrong. Chased a kill round a corner and died? Keep running into prenades? Just not aiming well? Try to find what you can do better and concentrate on what you could try to do better (far too easy to get tilted at other people if you let yourself :/ ) I've heard people say they top frag or second every game a lot. I find that hard to believe, but I've never been in silver so I wouldn't know. It's important to note a few things: -It's better to have a 1/2/3 games a day rather than ten in one go. You will rank up better/faster (as well as play better for those games.) -Do. Not. Leave. Games... Ever. It not only hurts your rank, but it hurts your trust factor. Losing a match doesn't matter, losing rounds does. So if you lose 14/15 rounds and want to leave, don't bother. You'll hurt your rank and TF more than if you just lose normally. (not saying you do this, but SO MANY people don't realise the loss of a match doesn't matter as much as the rounds.) -lower your mouse sens. I have about 1.1 with 800 dpi on mouse. Seriously. It's great. It'll feel weird, but you will find you start owning so much more (at least I did!) -If you can, play with at least one friend sometimes. If you can't get strats going with your team, you are at a massive disadvantage. Ok, now I'll try to run down some general things that can help. Don't know if they apply to you but for the sake of advice: -**always aim where the enemies heads will be** Doesn't matter where you are or how many are left. Get into the habit, this is key to getting great consistency. In csgo, consistency is king. -Don't just run into the enemy unless you have someone to trade you. Be patient and get used to playing the right angles with the right weapons. Don't hold short B to top mid with a bizon or shotgun. You're just playing with luck. -Stop walking, then shoot. I've seen people panic and just run around spraying. ''23 in 1 hit'' is what you'll see. Once you have that down, then work in jiggle strafing. -Are you king of the pistol rounds? I look at my past matches, if I don't get at least 1 kill in each, then I am the problem. Do not buy a pistol. Use your starter pistol and aim for the head. It takes 1 shot. Once you have that consistently then you can get fruity with your 1st round buys. -You're in silver so I don't know how the ''feel'' goes but try to get used to when people will rush or when people's economies are fucked. Buy together as a team. Stress the power of economy and the power of the 1st round bomb plant. Watch warowls vids on economy, it makes sense. If you sense they're gonna rush, hold back, wait for the nades and wait for the rush. Don't get greedy. -If you tilt, take a moment out and breathe. I just had a game today where a guy had like 2-3 kills after ten rounds. He was apologising, we just said ''no worries mate'' and he came back second half and just started started popping off. We were 4 players v 5 (a guy left 2 rounds in when we lost, idiot) and we went from like 3-12 to them to a 16-14 win to us (the last few rounds were tense!). If we turned round to him and starting throwing shade at him he probably wouldn't have done that well. Mind state is important! So is being friendly when you can easily be a dick! -concise comms. Let's say you are stairs on CT and get killed by an awp from palace. An example is ''1 palace, hit 45'' Boom. Done. No more. MAYBE say they have an awp (but that will be obvious) try to say your shit and let the rest go for it. -Ranking up is hard, but getting over the silver/nova and nova/mg threshold is much harder than say nova 2 to 3. Keep trying for that consistency. -hmmm, what else.... I've just typed this in a few minutes so it probs won't be the best. Ill try to find a couple of pages for you written by people who have thought this out more. Ill edit it in. If you think of any specific questions you want to ask, go for it man.

1548847700,2019-01-30,"Sorry for the wall of text... You asked a lot of questions. &amp;#x200B; I think you're kinda over-doing things a little, and you're asking a *lot* of questions, making this all rather hard to follow. Lets start from the top Don't put too much time into prefires and peeks until you're much better at the game. If you're looking to peek something quickly and rattle off a few shots or maybe snap to someone, you need better movement. I dunno what your movement is like, but you need a pretty good grasp on how to stop-shoot and such before you get into prefiring. Prefires are fast; can your movement skill match that? Learning nades is great, and you should definitely work on them! I'm mostly a fan of flashbangs, and have recently been hitting 20+ EF in most of my MM and Faceit games (Legendary Eagle MM), with everyone else usually topping out with an average of 5 EF, with some better players heading towards 12. Smokes are your second best friend aside flashes in my eyes, although with you being GN in MM, I find it hard to believe that your team will wait for you to throw it; let alone cover you whilst doing so. Lower ranked people also have a tendency to just run through smokes anyways. Maybe flashes would be more useful, but you'll just get shouted at with ""why you flash me man!"" or ""stop flashing"" because your team looks into the flash; despite you communicating it. Reviewing demos after your matches may be good, but also very time-consuming. I'd recommend just remembering your mistakes and working off of them. If you do decide to continue reviewing your own demos, I really wouldn't bother analyzing anyone but yourself at these ranks. You ask a lot about ""How much; when; where; what"" in regards to practicing. You seem really devoted, and I respect it, but don't wear yourself out. Doing too much might just tire you out and could possibly make you perform worse; and that's what it comes down to at the end of the day: performance in-game. Maybe spend at max an hour before a match warming up. Spend 30 minutes working on the strategic and gamesense side of the game; do nades and some prefires here; walk round some corners and shoot at exactly where you'd think someone might be and make sure the bullet goes straight (don't do prefire maps here; load up a local casual without bots and run around the map prefire-checking anything you feel would be appropriate, whilst also being considerate of all angles. Then spend 30 minutes on your aim. Load up a FFA server and get ready to get de\_stroyed by all the people that are probably better than you (I know the feeling). The best part about it is when you kill them, or even when you go on a little rampage. Outside of FFA, use maps like aim\_botz and [training\_aim\_csgo2](https://steamcommunity.com/id/TalkingKeyboard/myworkshopfiles/?appid=730&amp;browsefilter=mysubscriptions) to really get a feel for your mouse (the latter is my favorite!) How to stop crouching when shooting.. Well, it depends on when you're crouching. I often crouch when spraying, with one reason being that it forces your opponent to adjust their crosshair. Crouching at the right time may just yield you the kill. Crouching can kill you, though, due to the movement impediment. How to improve movements and stutter stepping: This all links back to the prefire stuff I mentioned previously. It's all about being able to successfully stop and regain accuracy. If you're not doing this already: Aim at a wall, don't move your mouse and shoot once to make a marker. Strafe out to the left; stop; shoot; move back to the middle; stop; shoot. This is a pretty good routine that you could do for 5 or so minutes *before* doing the casual prefire thing I mentioned. How to kill an awper camping: That really depends on the situation and also *really* depends on yours and your opponent's skill. Utility tends to be key here; going in dry might just get you killed; depending on who you're up against. Stop-shooting might just really help you here; especially if you align your crosshair up perfectly and hit a good prefire. Going back a little: I'd also suggest learning how to shoot in the correct location when it's smoked off: A good spam or tap through the smoke might just net you the kill if you know where you're looking. Music is personal preference I think. Personally, watching pros play won't do *too* much for you unless you're playing against people with a similar level of gamesense to you. The issue here is that no matter how smart you may be, if the enemy doesn't know what they're doing, you'll not be able to read or predict their plays. I personally watch Tarik's videos a lot, and that's somewhat added to the list of plays I know of, and has certainly changed the way I read situations, although I wouldn't rely on observing pro-level gameplay until you're at a similar level yourself. It's really all about thinking about what's happening right now. Where are you? Where's the bomb? Where are your opponents last seen? What gun did they have? Are they hit? How many players are alive? Do you have nades? Where can you go? What should you clear? Will they push you?... Lots of variables, and there are ***many*** more. In every situation, you need to think about probability: figure out what the most probable play from them is, and then think about what play is most probable to win *you* the round. Bad habits.. Don't under-estimate your enemies; don't over-face. I'm terrible with this. Defending B as a CT on Inferno; I tend to swing out from CT spawn on pistol rounds; maybe get 1 or two, and then get rushed down. Unless I'm being flashed in at the exact correct time to catch at least 3T players in this situation: I'm going to die; I'm going to get traded within (at maximum) 2 seconds, when playing Retake and backing out would almost always be the most effective play to make. &amp;#x200B; I hope this may somewhat help. I also hope multiple people see this... GLHF",0.091,0.739,0.17,0.9984,3

Couple of things that have massively helped me improve my games; Learning spray patterns. Download a spray training map and get used to handling that spray, memorise it for your most frequently used guns At close/med range it's key to consistent fragging. Learning to hold and peak/not peak angles. This is something that I'm still working on a lot, that is super important to CSGO. WarOwl does some good videos on this particularly about when you're visible and when you're not and between you, the angle, and your opponent how to take the advantage when peaking. Another key is when NOT to peak, how to take the off angle and how to play and angle. WarOwl and NadeKing are good YouTubers for this stuff. Playing with a friend that is better than you. One of my pals is a lot better than me and it's really helped me in terms of map sense, learning callouts and reading the opponent plays. This has been a great help to me. So befriend someone better than you and learn from them. Learning the economics. I'm shit at eco. Or rather I used to be. But keeping a few figures in mind can really help. Like how much a full buy will cost. How much a pistol round loss/win/x2 kills will net you. What the rewards are related to each win conditions for both teams. This enables you to predict for instance when the opposing team might carry and AWP for instance, when to eco, when to throw a round in hopes of winning the next etc. Or how to stop a win condition for the opposing team to put them at a eco disadvantage. Most important... Have fun and don't take it too seriously. Relax, get on the mic, be vocal, talk to your teammates, make callouts, have a laugh, have a good round, have a bad round, take it as it comes.",0.073,0.752,0.175,0.9909,1

If you lose and start going “WELL I ONLY LOST CAUSE MY TEAM DID...” Then you will continue to lose, at GN2 all the way up to global you don’t need teamwork, learn to flash for yourself, time your utility read your opponent from just the round timer and sounds(nades, smokes across the map etc) Also if you practice for 2-4 hours of DM. Stop. Cause you can’t keep that up consistently, it’s like exercise consistency is key. You can go hard as fuck and lift insane weights, completely tear your body up but you probably won’t be able to do that everyday.

Now you can say it is partly there fault butttt if you take this as seriously as you say you do, then you should be looking back and say why you lost maybe you missed a shot that could of made it 3-2 instead of 2-2 and giving them the site. Maybe you had no utill to hold off a rush (SO IMPORTANT NOT TO WASTE UTILL) Your team mates may lose you silly rounds but you might lose them important rounds, when the economy round is in flux and that round decides who gets the lead economically.

1558523674,2019-05-22,"Record a few of your games and have a look at what you're doing wrong. Ask yourself: -Am I taking the right routes? -Am I planting in a good spot? -Am I making good use of the info I have? -Do I have good crosshair placement? -Am I obvious and expectable? You'll instantly see improvement once you start to acknowledge your mistakes. For aim, buy a decently sized mousemat. Make sure your pad is at least 25cm wide (45cm is recommended). Then follow this guide to find your perfect sensitivity: https://youtu.be/uxBuiD11WDM After finding a good sensitivity practice on deathmatch for 15 minutes once every morning before your comp games and once after your comp games. Try not to go higher than 1600eDPI (eDPI = sens * DPI, e.g. 2.5 * 400 = 1000eDPI) and try not to go lower than 800eDPI (in my opinion you should only go lower than 800eDPI if you have a great team and if you don't play entry frag). Getting used to a lower sensitivity is key to improving your accuracy and landing more frags. Also, try to stand still when you shoot, your bullets will be very inaccurate if you move. Once you get better you'll learn how to counterstrafe/stutter stepping (quickly stand still after strafing a distance, this means you can move to dodge bullets whilst also keeping accuracy) For movement, play CSGO surf to learn how to strafe properly and to improve your coordination. A good YouTuber to learn from is LuckySkillFaker. He can teach you a lot about the game. You'll know when you improved when you start being more consistent. Once you have improved, it's time to find a team! Gamerlink is a good app to find a team on but I recommend using the in-game LFG function or add people who are friendly. You *must* remember that a person doesn't have to be good for you to add him. You can add a bad player and improve at the game with him, this will make the game much more enjoyable rather than adding a good sweaty player which will spend half his time raging and complaining about how he carried you and still lost. Also, CSGO's ELO system is a strange one. It rewards you more based on consecutive days over consecutive matches. For example: Let's say I won 7 matches in one day and I get 100 ELO (not accurate, just example). If I won 1 match per day for a week (7 matches total) I would get 150 ELO (not accurate, just example). So try to split your sessions across days rather than grinding in one day then skipping 2 days after. One final tip, be sure to have fun. Wanting to win is ok but expecting to win will only frustrate you. Staying calm and relaxed is key to performing as best as you can. Play a lot too, practice makes perfect. If you're doing good but still can't get out of S2 then it's time to make a new account. EDIT: I completely forgot to add map knowledge. To learn maps you want to watch YouTube and streams. Also make sure you only play active duty maps and Cache (the maps with a blue/orange symbol at the top left). You will see these maps in tournaments which means you can learn very cool tricks and nades on them (you won't see Cache but Cache is just a great map to play, and they'll probably add it back into active duty after some balancing changes) That's the end of this. Best of luck with your games and I hope to see you out of silver 2 soon! :) My sens is 2.5 @ 400DPI if you just want to copy that rather than doing perfect sensitivity approximation (which can be very boring and tedious).",0.054,0.718,0.228,0.9991,1
1558532856,2019-05-22,"Damn well I already typed out all of this so here you go for your previous comment: Ah yeah that's a good one. Nothing better than a nice clean 1 tap, but in my experience, striving for 1 taps all the time isn't the best mind set. Being able to control the spray of your gun will effectively double your skill in the game. Assuming your crosshair placement is already decent, if you have control of the spray, the bullets will eventually find their way to the enemy's head. There's a really good workshop map to learn spray control, with a decent amount of practice of course. Another thing that I learned way back is that I never had the right sensitivity for me. A good tip is to go to an aim map with bots, and try flicking to their heads with an ak or something, even a pistol. You'll notice that you'll either be over shooting, or under shooting quite a bit. You can adjust your sensitivity accordingly. Finally, when I was first starting out, playing in silver and gold nova I was always aiming just a little too low. Even now when I'm playing in gold nova on an alt with my friends, I notice them and many other gold novas are also aiming just a little too low, around neck and upper chest level. When fixing this for myself, I remember it feeling real uncomfortable, but when I would force myself to aim higher than I thought was right, I was more likely to hit headshots. All in all, when looking for headshots, crosshair placement and sensitivity is key. Knowing where the enemy's head will be, and having a sensitivity comfortable enough to be allmake small adjustments in aim when your target actually does present itself. Remember to stay relaxed, stay focused, and stay patient, and you'll be hitting headshots in no time. Best of luck!",0.068,0.785,0.147,0.9826,1

They are mostly awpers with insane reactions that hit you the exact moment you shoulder peak, or they do insane peaks that will kill you before you even see them. These awpers usually have scores like 27-2, 24-1 etc. Rage botters. These exist in prime and are usual. Similar to aimbot but you bind it to a key. This is what switching is all about. You press that key and you instantly headshot the opponent closer to your crosshair. Can't be exploited because it can be easily found by overwatch. Biggest giveaway is when theyvuse awp. You'll just see then getting every awp kill with headshot and on top of that point black rage shots gonna be also headshot. Another giveaway is when you shoot them from the back and just turn around one tapping you(after the have one tapped your entire team). They usually start with insanely bad scores. They will have many bad rounds and many times you'll ask yourself how this guy is first from the enemy and how he one tapped you 3-4 rounds in a row. Aimlockers. You hold a key and the crosshair locks to your opponents head as long as you hold it. They are the same as the rage otters, but easier to deal with most of the time.

Dead giveaway is if the player has hit many jumpshots always run/shoots, and some people that peak while running right or left but shotting at the same time headshot ting your whole team. Easilly punishable by overwatch. People are too cautious with it. Radar hackers. Be careful those are extremely usual, hard to catch, almost never punishable. They absolute see everything in the radar. Usually this comes with a wh package. The giveaway is if the same guy always camps always the perfect spot in which your team attacks, or rushes your whole team by throwing perfect nades round after round(obviously if he does it 2-3 times that doesn't mean he is radar hacking, but if he done it like 10 times then you should maybe start thinking about it). Finally, wall hack. Extremely common in many tiers. Easy to understand who is using it by his amount of prefires. You'll probably see them prefiring broken(dead) angles, extremely unusual spots that are hard to guess, and generally making insane prefires in spots that they have 0 info for. If you call them out for it they will say some random ass bullshit(mostly sound, even though they prefire exactly the spot you are standing, exactly on your head) and this is because they wanna make it legit to their teammates that are watching. It's easy to make this hack look legit and is rarely punishable. Worst hack of them all by far. And aim bitters that you rarely see nowadays because they are soo easily detectable by vac and overwatch that are banned after 10 hours at most. PS: I tried these hacks with a group of friends the other day(my friend's pc) in a temporal account that we made just to see how they really work. We spent around 8 euros iirc. They usually come into packages. I never use cheats in my main account and I believe anyone who uses them is a fucking trash human being. Since I tested these hacks it's a lot easier to identify who is a good player and who is using cheats and hacks. My point is that mm is still fully infested with hackers, they are less than before, but they are still there. The obvious aimbotters seem to be extremely reduced from prime mm tho.",0.129,0.769,0.103,-0.9737,24

Most of the closet cheaters in MM don't use ESP (Wallhacks) to avoid gamebans. And If your opponent is really bad at cheating and if he/she making it obvious that person will get banned from OW for sure. &amp;#x200B; ""Wouldn't the cheat take away the skill thereby making it more boring? "" To answer this question I need to tell you what is closet cheating. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Closet cheating is cheating with the minimum amount of assistance. To closet cheat you at least need a bit of skill and knowledge of the game. If you have played the game legit over 100+ hours you can closet cheat easily. Now this is why closet cheating is fun to people who wants clout. They look legit while they're cheating. There are streamer options of cheats which hides the UI of the cheat for OBS or NVIDIA GTX recorder (whatever that called). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; As I said I don't closet cheat and I only cheat at community hack versus hack servers but I know how to not get banned while closet cheating. I have over 500 hours on multiple accounts and I can play with minimum assistance and no wallhacks. I know grenade/smoke spots and many other things. Most important part of hiding your cheats is your crosshair placement and movement. Not saying that you need to bhop all the time just learn how to walk and avoid bumping into walls everytime. If you make your cheats too obvious and if everyone in the game reports you just stop playing for that day. You only show up in OW if you have 10+ reports in a day. &amp;#x200B; How to spot a cheat: They usually hit double bhops everytime. Some don't strafe so you can report them for sure. A normal player can't hit double or singe bhops everytime, that's impossible. Or just watch their movement overall. If you're in lem elo and that person walks like a retarded, report. &amp;#x200B; Watch their crosshair placement and compare it with their frags. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Most of them trash talk a lot. This doesn't mean the person is cheating but if you think he is cheating and if he's toxic consider watching him more focused. &amp;#x200B; Watch if they oneway on a wallbang spot and hit someone everytime. A normal player wouldn't risk spoiling their position just for a wallbang. &amp;#x200B; And look at their profiles. It's probably hidden or just the hours hidden but if it's not hidden and if person has decent amount of hours look at their friends list, groups, comments, previous aliases. If you find something suspicious report. Don't get fooled by their inventories if they got very expensive skins. Zuhn got banned several times with loads of knives. &amp;#x200B; The keywords you need to be searching: &amp;#x200B; Skeet, AW, OT, Onetap, Aimware, Fanta, Paste, HvH. &amp;#x200B; If they have a friend with these keywords on their profiles they're %100 cheating no way they're legit.

Know basic nade-throws Knowing throws like the 3 usually thrown on A on mirage is usually where most people start. You can look up ""how to execute A on mirage"" on YouTube.

Also I've noticed Cs go is the type of game you have to play almost everyday to improve. Even if I'm off for a week or two it takes several days of playing just to get back to where I was. And the longer the break the longer it takes. Another thing is to learn how to get into bombsites, typically you don't always want to rush and you def don't peak without a flash or some smoke set up. And always set up trade kills like you rush out first or your teammate but quickly have the other person be out too to get that trade. And as a ct if you just hold angles and put up smokes or mollies and never rush you can get to gold nova 4 pretty quick. The key is just thinking about what you're doing as a T and as a CT just hold. Of course it gets more complicated as you get higher up but just that can get you to mg. Edit: for me I noticed I would improve best if I played like 3-5 hours straight and much more.

Then when you peek out, counter your movement with the opposite strafe key. So if you're a CT on Dust2 at peeking long coming from CT, you should peek the left side of long first, using just the A key, and if you're gonna fire, you just quickly tap D, and then fire at the same time to get perfect accuracy when you pull the trigger.

1562463035,2019-07-07,"Don't listen to him, any game is a great game to start off with. Here are some tips I have for you about CS:GO and PC gaming in general. 1. Don't get invested in what others say, don't respond in a negative way and honestly, just don't respond to any toxicity. 2. Enable any sort of 2FA you can for your accounts. Steam has steam guard and many other sites use Google Authenticator. 3. Don't cheat, at all. Not only is it extremely rude to cheat, the small amount of happiness you would get from the one win won't be worth it compared to legitimate wins. 4. Make sure you have a reliable mouse, headset, and a decent keyboard. Everyone will have their own preference in these, but I recommend a mouse with less macro buttons, such as the G403. For a headset I prefer HyperX on the higher end, but the G430 is pretty good for the price, just never use the USB sound card that is included. 5. For in game settings, I'd recommend sticking with your native resolution for the time being. Now for your sensitivity, I'd recommend an eDPI in the 700-1500 range, but this is completely up to you. To find what feels nice with you, I recommend starting with an eDPI of 1200 and changing it to whatever feels good. I used to increment my changes in large jumps, but I get used to New sensitivity quickly. Players such as woxic play amazingly well with an eDPI of 3200 and this is because of my next point. 6. Consistency. The key to getting better at any game is consistency. This can be as little as 10 minutes of aim practice before you play, to having the same schedule everyday, like getting home from school, do homework, play for 3 hours, eat dinner, sleep. This all depends on the type of player you are. 7. Make sure you keep an eye on your real life. I understand using videogames as an escape, but if your grades start suffering or your work performance drops, prioritize those instead. 8. If you really want to get good quickly, then I have some maps I would recommend you use. The maps I mostly use would be the YPRAC set of maps by Yesber. His maps have many routines to help you learn the mechanics of CS:GO, but most skill comes by just playing the game. That's all I can really think of for now, but if you have any questions, you can ask me here or add me on steam at steamcommunity.com/id/rustiii or on Discord at rusti#0001",0.023,0.798,0.179,0.997,2

Funny thing was when I started off as gold nova 3 I assembled a team of randoms. After few weeks of playing only with them I got MGE. That time I met my first LEM in enemy team smurfing. He was really good. When I got to DMG I lost it quite fast and thought that staying there is harder cause players use different tricks and tactics and OBVIOUSLY you begin to have complete noobs unbefitting their ranks as your teammates. After 2 weeks of playing (not everyday) I got to a point where DMG was quite easy. If you want to invest in ranking up and being better than maybe buy good set of headphones, mouse, keyboard. Good equipment gives you a very big advantage. Next, adjust configurations, i.e. turn off useless music, sound, reduce voice chat to 10-11, use 10 second alarm music. Bind hotkeys, set your own comfortable sensitivity, etc. For example, I use 4:3 screen ratio with low graphs. As soon as I started using good computer I became LEM in a week. Now before you start playing MM make sure to warm up about 15 minutes. Play custom game (aimbotz is good map where you can shoot running bots from every weapon). Play some ffa servers or deathmatch. Let your muscle memory flex. When you are playing a hopeless case don't invest too many emotions and efforts. Just play for fun and try doing some crazy stuff you don't usually do, train your aim. So in conclusion TL;DR buy better equipment, set your own comofrtable settings excluding useless custom ones, warm up before game, find a good team of same level and non toxic relationships, don't get too upset and try new stuff.",0.083,0.733,0.184,0.9831,6

Movement: Csgo is nothing like all the other FPS Games out there. You cant run and shoot at the same time. Its called „Walking Penalty“. If you run you will have a very low chance if hitting your enemy. Stay still and also maybe crouch to get the highest precision. Another thing i am going to include is peaking. If your mate dies to an Awp on long range, dont try to peak him too. Try to use other possibilities and ways. 3. Communication You need to talk to your teammates and tell them what is going on at your position. And also be precise. When you see 3 people rushing you, dont say “ALL B” Be precise. If your teammates dont give any calls or information, encourage them to do so. Without information you wont be able to retake a site as a CT or rotate to a site as a T for example. I‘ll also include Map knowledge as the (4): Knowing where to go and where the best spots are to defend a site is also important because if you stand in the open you could be killed by 1000 different angles. Learning the angles for smokes, nades, flashbangs and mollys is also very useful to keep the enemy of defending their position successfully. And the last tiny advise i‘ll give you from now on is: Practice! Noone is the best from the first minutes of playing a new game!

In most FPS this is frowned upon, but when holding a site, being able to hold an angle and only moving around in a very small area is key to protecting a site on the CT side and T side after plant. Get to know the maps, try and figure out timings so you can hold the correct angles to entry points. Utility is also massively import, know where to smoke, where to molly and use he grenades to soften up opponents that are pushing or holding a site. Timing is everything, a well placed molly can hold back enemies just long enough to reposition or for help to rotate.",0.031,0.914,0.055,0.3182,3

I personaly buy my skins I dont much momey into it. There are other things out there that are much better than buying ""pixels"". It is pretty dumb to put lots of money into it, But its their money and it makes them happy. Opening cases is pretty dumb as well. It is really rare to get a knife by unboxing one. You see youtubers and streamers unboxing rare dopplers and shit. Realistically most of them blow INSANE amounts of money on cases and they dont make any profit but most of them just want a knife and dont care about profit. But blowing all that money is really a investment too, Most unboxing videos make lots of views and they easily earn the money back and might make profit depending on how much money they dropped. But if your just a average player, Theres a really high chance that by the time you actually get a knife, All the money you spent on cases will be much more than the knife is worth. You could unbox a rare knife and make profit that is if you didn't blow $1,000 on cases and keys like lots of players i've met have done. I really dont get how some skins are so fucking expensive. Like the souvenir awp dragon lore is $20,000 like who the fuck will pay for a sniper with golden stickers on it? With that much money, I can build a duel gaming setup with 3 240hz moniters or maybe triple. I'm not getting in details with the specs because you get my point. Its really not all ridiculous though. Gaming is consideres a sport now. Like having a signed football is like having kennyS signature sticker in a sense. Like having a baseball signed by babe ruth is worth absolutely way more than the all the rarest skins combined. So there kind of the same except the sport itself. They have there perks though. If you have a rare baseball, pokemon card, football, And etc. You have to keep it in mint condition or else its not worth much. If you have a rare skin, You don't have to worry about preserving it. You got to worry about the economy not going to shit or people duplicating the skin, Getting scammed, getting vac or trade banned (if you cheat/scam), Or more people unbox the skin making it less valuable. So that is my opinion on that matter. Dont cheat or scam because thats a shit thing to do.",0.074,0.734,0.192,0.9948,1

1564720782,2019-08-02,"The odds are absolutely horrible no matter what case you get in all honesty. You're almost always better off just making a realistic budget and buying the skins you want individually. If you're opening cases to get knives prepare to sink hundreds of dollars into case keys, and on the other end, it makes no sense to spend 20 bucks on keys if you're looking to get a 20-50 dollar skin. 99.9% of people you see in games will have this grandious story about trading or hitting it big and trading up, when most of them are just embarrassed to admit they spent their parents money or are an adult that spent 300 dollars on a video game knife. It is very possible to trade up and hit it big with cases but the odds are just insanely against you. My advice would be go on csgo stash, browse by case, get familiar with what cases have the items youd like and take it from there. Bitskins will generally be a cheaper place to buy skins in comparison to the steam market. Go on steam app and set up 2 step verification if you havent (trades will take 2 weeks to process without VS instantly with it), this process takes 7 days to complete so do it asap. Also, a site like lootbear will allow you to rent things like knives for a ""reasonable price"". Since items have a 1 week trade cooldown every time they are traded, you essentially add 7 days worth of credit to your acct (1-5 dollars per day on avg depending on knife) and get to use a knife for a week. I reccomend this because personally I would never advise anyone making less than 6 figures a year to consider buying a csgo knife (just my personal opinion) without an extensive knowledge of what is going to rise/drop in price and the potential to profit from your buy. Last thing I want to add is that every ""case site"" is bullshit. The fact that most of them advertise as ""easy profit"" just shows they're looking to rope in diluted kids.

1566226795,2019-08-19,"You should be always trying to shoot at the head cuz deals more dmg. For that, your aim should be always on head level. Do not go around the map looking at the ground and then flick to the player. That's a common mistake of begginers. You should know that with pistols (not deagle) and smgs you can walk while shooting. Deagle, rifles and snipers you have to be still for max accuracy when shooting. There's also the recoil on weapons, (tip: on the ak-47, just get ur aim on the body of the enemy and shoot, pulling your crossair downwards. The first 4/5 bullets will kill him. You don't need more. Iz tutorial of how to frag :D) but you have to research that out on your own. You need to learn how to strafe. Ex. while moving to right, using d, the fastest way to get your speed reduce to 0, is by pressing a, while letting go of d. That will make you stop so that you can shoot where you are aiming at, at that moment. (When you see someone that killed you while walking and then stopped, that's a strafe. On lower levels you will see people saying ""RUNNING HS AHAHAH VAC"". Just a little reminder so you don't make a fool out of yourself like those people) You can also do the same thing by using the Ctrl button to croutch. The effects are the same. By keep walking you will do a ""crab walk"" which is a nice mechanic on Csgo. By aware of the minimap and sound (and chat if you wanna know if your team sent any smokes flahes etc). Very important tool that people don't use until they get to mg or smth xd Spam is important (Smokes, he nades, flashes and molotovs). Try to use it wisely. When you get to better ranks, people will ask you flashes and that's when you know that your playing a more serious cs. You can get your own binds. You will need a jumpthrow bind later on. You can instabuy equipment by pressing numbers, say sentences and other things. You will need an autoexec with binds and other codes (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\userdata\\999999\\730\\local\\cfg) destination folder. When running csgo on steam, useful launch options ""-high -refresh 144 -tickrate 128 -novid -nod3d9ex1 +exec autoexec"" If you have a 60Hz monitor change to ""-refresh 60"" Get a nice crosshair or make one on your own. There are maps on workshop that can do that. [https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=730&amp;actualsort=trend&amp;browsesort=trend&amp;p=1&amp;days=-1](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=730&amp;actualsort=trend&amp;browsesort=trend&amp;p=1&amp;days=-1) Map 1, 2, 4, 6 you should give them a look. Having a good monitor, pc, mouse, keyboard ofc it helps a lot. Having 300fps and a 24'',144hz monitor will give you a huge advantage against people with laptops and not so good pcs. When you win most of your duels, know the maps, use spam, (a skill level like lem) if you wanna get to the next level, your should play faceit and get a team. Btw, the higher ranks on matchmaking have too many cheaters so you're just wasting your time. Climb on faceit and after lv7, you will start playing some real cs. These are long run tips. Start S1mple, get CoMpLex. If you wanna play the game for fun with no general goal just take a look at the basic mechanics like strafe and good crosshair placement. If you wanna get a little spicier, you have the starting tips here. Watch streams, get more knowledge, get better. Csgo is a nice game but the community isn't that nice cuz of retards with cheats.

Look at the guns purchased so far in the ongoing major. The gun meta has been ak/ m4 and awp. The new meta is this plus kreigs and augs plus more low cost smgs been used. 3.

Maybe u should thank greeks philosophers for defining the democratic values and political system and for a huge amount of philosophy, Geometry, architecture, awesome mythology that inspired different works of art oh and for building the basis of modern WESTERN CULTURE. Thank greeks for kick starting the liberation of the Balkans . Ooh if greece was so bad, then why do people risk their lives to immigrate here? Turkish culture , idfk anything about it but their religion is anti-freedom and sexist but then again idk much about turkey. Poland hasn't done much tbh but i reckon it's not a toxic culture because it's a ripoff of russian culture. Russian culture isn't toxic, like why would people continue marrying russian women if russian culture was toxic? All cultures have their pros and cons but the cultures with the least cons are the best and they are pretty much all of western cultures. The worst cultures are those of indigenous african nation and asian nations . For example chinese people have a bullshit belief that eating a tiger penis is therapeutic and tigers who are already endangered continue dying for that. This is part of their culture . Indian culture has *shitting, cleaning dishes , drinking and washing themselves * as part of their culture and this obviously is a bad culture as this damages the ecosystem and nature in general (their culture belief is that nobody should clean their river it is ""sacred"") Africans continue to kill some women and albinos becuz their bad culture believes they are witches and cursed. Just know that western cultures are the best. I'm saying that all cultures are not equal and that my country's culture and generally western cultures are the best .

1569923931,2019-10-01,"this feature only appeared in December when they released the Danger Zone update, when Valve changed the animation code. Previously, there was something similar called fake angles, when the server animated only the first movement command in a batch (choked packets and then sent packet) which means the server would use the angle from the first packet to animate the hitboxes and then send the last packet to the clients for them to animate it. They changed it so the server animated all the commands in a batch and sent the last command to the client. Good, right? Nope, this made the problem better but still exploitable. Using the same methods cheaters can desync their abs angles (goal feet angles) up to 58 degrees away from their hitboxes (amount is based on velocity, moving is about 25 degrees, that's one of the main reasons cheaters use a feature to walk slower than normal), and the reason the legs are twisted is because there's an angle named LBY (or Lower Body Yaw) which is self explanatory, and when standing still it only updates if it's more than 110 degrees away from your viewangles or every 1.1 seconds, which means cheaters can predict when it will update and tell the server ""I'm looking in this direction"" and choke the packet (so it's silent) which makes the pose desync range larger. Valve could fix this easily by only animating the last packet in a batch on the server, instead of all of them. There's an addon for community servers that fixes the issue. The cheat provider the guy in the video is using recently added this feature as a legit feature (instead of a rage feature) but completely messed it up on release, making it so you couldn't climb ladders and your legs kept sliding (since they weren't fixing IN_ keys, which are used for the sliding animation when counter-strafing away from your velocity direction) EDIT: Overwatchers won't be able to see if The Suspect is desyncing, but they can see if allies or enemies are desyncing. This is not Overwatch bait, people just think it's just funny to do versus legit players, but the main usage is so closet cheaters miss head since the aimbot aims perfectly at the head hitbox. Legit players won't have much of an issue unless the enemy is desyncing at an edge like in the video",0.124,0.83,0.046,-0.9884,3

1575567899,2019-12-05,"I think it's pretty obvious that Overwatch is not really working. The purpose of any anti-cheat is to block all cheaters from accessing the game servers or permanently remove them from the game servers. That means all. Doesn't matter how little or much he/she is cheating. It's still cheating. Honestly i have seen a huge increase in the number of cheaters (per number of games) and that happened after Overwatch came out as a ""anti-cheat feature"" and even more as CS:GO went f2p. What concerns me is that even though there are ways of dealing with cheaters which haven't been implemented into the game, Valve just chooses to stick to it's methods and launch a gigantic ""middle finger"" to all the honest players by not doing anything about the cheater problem. Does anyone remember AMX ModX from CS 1.6? Do you guys remember that there was a very useful (although a bit tedious) feature that allowed a private server admin to trigger a screenshot command onto the client and thus creating an actual image of what the client was seeing on his monitor. I remember it clearly since i was an admin and i saw a lot of interesting things from cheaters who were trying to minimize the visual output of the cheat so that they might avoid ""detection"". Don't you think such a feature would be better implemented into CSGO as well? I am obviously not talking about the ""Screenshot"" feature that Steam has but the ""Print Screen"" button on your keyboard which, when pressed, it capture the actual graphic rendering of the screen at the time of the press.",0.085,0.833,0.082,-0.402,1

1576518510,2019-12-16,"In 2018 I climbed out of Silver and peaked at GN3 I stopped playing because it was a lot of work to keep my GN2 rank and I burned out. For that climb, I practiced specifically every day. My goal was to practice one round's worth of time every day I played. (This was part of the reason I burned out, so find your personal limit). It was a good plan for getting better, and I enjoyed the success of seeing my game and my rank improve. The first commitment I recommend is developing a warmup routine. For me, my warmup routine is aim practice and lasts 10-15 minutes. I do this every time I play. When I skip this, I absolutely play worse. My KD and HS% directly reflect this. I chose aim practice as my warmup routine for now because I've never been particularly good at aim. Getting out of Silver is going to require smart play, and improved skill. (Side note: TALENT is natural, SKILL is learned.) You're going to end up in a shitty PUG 20%+ if the time, and the more you can minimize that, the faster you will rank up. Next commitment is skill improvement. Any day you have time for 2+ rounds, take time pre-war up to learn a new skill or practice an old one. For me, this was learning smokes. It took me only a handful of sessions to learn 8 Mirage smokes. Now I just practice them about once a week. I can repeat this with Molly's or move to Cache, or whatever. Look for YouTube videos or check out practice maps in the Steam Workshop by DOLNMA. You could choose a different skill though that fits your style more. Such as recoil control, hitting moving targets, peeking corners, retakes, etc. Choose one and work on it until you go from 'noob' to 'great for my skill level'. The key is to keep improving. On purpose. And to never forget to revisit the basics every day. It's just like any sport. Even Aaron Rodgers has to practice the handoff. Imagine that.",0.024,0.791,0.186,0.9945,2

Next have a keybind to clear the commands in the console command history, the animation cache, bombs and debugs with this command: bind t ""clear;clear_anim_cache;clear_debug_overlays;clear_bombs"" You can replace the ""t"" with any key you would like. Everytime you press ""t"" or the key you binded it boosts my fps back to 55 or sometimes even 70. Again something personal but one of my biggest ways to boost fps.

Watching Pros or Streamers with high ranks can give you a sense of how to communicate properly, without talking too much. Even when somebody doesnt talk, being in a team which is used to play with each other will take a lot of the random factors out of the game. The lower the rank gets, the higher the randomness of the game rises.

In addition to that try practicing your aim and learn some grenades, it will make upranking way easier. And very important: Buy grenades and use them. From my own experience I know, at lower ranks people like to not buy grenades and if they do, they won't use them. Rather use a grenade when it's unnecessary, instead of not using it at all. Maybe try switching up your crosshair, viewmodel, sensitivity, etc. settings and find the ones that suit you the best. Last: Try to rationalize as much as you can and reflect on your own mistakes, blaming others is easy, but admitting your mistakes and thinking about them will make you better. This will get less if you have some friends who you play with on a regular basis, since you will get used to each others play style and will know how to adapt to it.",0.073,0.782,0.145,0.9671,1

1579556949,2020-01-20,"Edit, I launched csgo, tried it and got a solution. In fact it's simple, you just need to do what I said but also let each command not only change the bind but also call the other command. Like that each setup will activate and change your bind to call the other setup. To make it simple i rename each setup ""bhop"" and ""normal"" to do it type this : Alias normal ""bind MWHEELUP invnext ; bind MWHEELDOWN inprev ; bind z bhop"" Alias bhop ""bind MWHEELUP +jump ; bind MWHEELDOWN +jump ; bind z normal"" Now when you type normal in the console it will set your mouse wheel to scroll weapons, and when you type bhop it will set your mouse wheel to jump. But there is also the [bind z normal/bhop] in each command so when you press z it not only change the setup but also switch your z to call the other setup next time. Now you can bind z to bhop to start the cycle (you can put any key at the place of z but remember to change it in the 3 commands lines). In short, type this : Alias normal ""bind MWHEELUP invnext ; bind MWHEELDOWN inprev ; bind z bhop"" Alias bhop ""bind MWHEELUP +jump ; bind MWHEELDOWN +jump ; bind z normal"" Bind z bhop",0.019,0.951,0.03,0.0772,2

I’ve tried two different keyboards in multiple different ports, with everything unplugged too. I’ve tried adjusting the keyboard control panel settings. Vsync is off in game and In Nvidia control panel. I’ve tried various graphics settings. I’ve disabled full screen optimaztions and ran in admin mode. I’ve disabled 3D audio.

To simplify what i mean as low sensitivity follow this simple rule: Your mice must have a 360 degrees turn ingame going to the left side of your mousepad until the right side. Bigger pads, lower sensitivity. Go to a offline server. Point to a place and then make your character make a complete turn and look at the same place. This complete turn must be your entire mousepad.

Usually Zowie mices are the best and what most pro players use. But you can search what sensor the zowies use and follow other low cost products with the same sensor. The rest like ""dpi stuff, Collors, etc"" are just propaganda and Will not affect your game at all. People sell you things like speed mousepads or control mousepads, but this is acctually about confort. Pick one who have a good aderence to your desk and stay in position while you play.

1586471441,2020-04-09,"Consistent good play is key. Also don’t neglect your utility usage and the round objective. CS:GO uses a modified GLICKO-2 ranking system. Many factors contribute to your rank including k/d, k/a/d, utility damage, enemies flashed, “round influence”, perceived teamwork by the algorithm, and w/l ratio, amongst others. In a GLICKO-2 system the expected outcome of the match also weights the gains/losses to your rank. Based on your teammates and opponents skill level the expected outcome is determined and if the actual outcome lines up with that prediction the bumps/hits to everyone’s respective rank are less than if the opposite outcome is achieved. If you are in a match that the system expects you to lose and your team ends up winning, then you and everyone on your team gets a higher bump to your stats than if it was a match that your team was expected to win. Likewise for the opposition. Many components are kept as a “black box” that the public is not informed of to keep people from abusing the system entirely.

Movement is a big problem for many players, now heres my catch, I love csgo. If I had the time (which is limited by either my mom or my team not wanting to play and solo q being shit) I would have more than 800hrs rn. I know many things were'nt intended but didn't got bugfixed because those are cool features; bhopping, surfing, not getting falldamage if you land on weird angles. Which is all movement based, since I aint got the best reaction time (I think never tested it) and don't have the best aim, I heavily focused on movement in cs when I started. Reading that the movement doesn't feel good makes me sad since I think csgo has the best movement I've ever seen/felt. I like the abilities tho and since its gonna be developed by Riot games, we will probably have many updates, I play league of legends aswell and the amount of times you needing to wait for a teammate that didn't notice a update is stupidly high XD. I love the idea with the abilities. But here's the thing... Its Riot games. We will find way to many OP stuff. everytime Riot games released a new champion in league, he was meta. There was a ""toplane"" meta consisting of Mordekaiser, Garen and Darius. We had Sett for a while and the amount of rage quites and broken desks he caused is huge. He just broke through the scores and is now the #1 toplaner. Also a big problem is point and click. There are champions like garen who'm I mentioned earlier that don't require any skill and will win way to many fights just because of their abilities. Garen is good, not the player playing him. Which is gonna be a huge problem in an tactical shooter aswell. If there is some ability that is low risk high reward (which exists way to often fuck you Riot who the fuck invented fiddlesticks or master yi?) then he will easily the topfragger in everygame, getting into an rank he never should've been.

1586627610,2020-04-11,"Hello! Good job on your ace! I have a few suggestions on how you could improve. Seeing the video was enough. Firstly, i toyally recommend you not to play awp too much until you are a consistent player with a rifle. You will play with a rifle mostly, so you need to be a good rifler before taking the awp in your hands. Watch movement videos on youtube (made by warowl for example) and other players and also practice what you see there. Movemement and crosshair placement is key in winning duels, so you might as well want to improve that. Do play respawn, but from the community server browser. This combined with workshop maps for your aim/reactions/flicks. I have a very good one, will post it here after i find it on youtube. You need to develop muscle memory and also trust your muscle memory. The best way is that aim map and playing a lot of respawn. You ll see that after some training and when you ll see the improvement, you ll be able to flick much quicker and much more effectively. Watch pro games so you develop your gamesense. That will win you many clutch rounds that would look lost, or will help you spot when you should rotate, when you should call for help etc. Gamesense and they way you judge a situation may be just as important as your aim. Last but not least, when i play soloqueue i never trust my teammates. Always play like you are 1v5 because that s what will keep you alive. Of course you ll have to take risks now and then but usually never blindly truat that your teammate will hold your flank, flash for you, help you in any situation. In matchmaking that usually doesn t happen. If you have any questions i am more than happy to answer them.",0.043,0.749,0.208,0.996,5

1586731761,2020-04-12,"Hey, It's likely because you're not performing up to the other players' expectations, which is pretty shitty, if you ask me. Unfortunately, matchmaking can be quite toxic at times. In my experience (about 3 years of playing Global Offensive), very little factors *can* contribute to getting kicked out of a match: Missing a kill, getting killed constantly, not following meta rules (when to eco when to go full buy, how many players go where), not planting the bomb on time, not saving a highly valuable weapon (the AWP, for example), not following dead teammates' instructions in 1vX scenarios (this one is silly though). If you want to play matchmaking, then I suggest studying the game mechanics a bit, not just by playing casually. Watch tutorials on YouTube, and perhaps some tournament matches on Twitch. It's going to assist you to be better at matchmaking when it comes to tactics and decision making. I also highly recommend queuing with friends who are familiar with your skill level. Or finding friends in casual game mode who are performing around your level and then invite them to matchmaking. It's also key that you don't get tilted when some harasses you. The best way to go about it is to mute any players who show any sign of agression or intent to harass. You can also report them. So in short, study the game a bit more, get into MM with people you know, keep cool and be friendly, mute and report anybody who verbally abuses or tries to harass you.",0.12,0.729,0.151,0.5553,4

For the record, I play/love plenty of other FPS games, and am sure that valorant won’t kill established scenes in those respective games either. I’m not speaking out of concern for survival of any game. My problem with the game, is the fact that it was marketed as the 5v5 tactical shooter, that finally solved all the big issues in CSGO. This is why I’m drawing the comparisons to CSGO. Now, if riot had delivered on that assertion, then I wouldn’t really be bothered. Yes, the game is still in beta, but the longer it takes to tighten up the game, the higher the chance of a flop. This is the honest route I predict for the game. Streamers have already started playing much less, most active streams are replays of streams, where streamers scam thousands of dollars while dropping beta keys. The initial hype hasn’t exactly delivered, and if things aren’t fixed soon, I don’t know if it can recover. Viewership has already dropped by 89% since launch, and id bet a large number of the remaining 11% are idle watching stream re-runs, in order to get a key drop. If the game doesn’t live up to its initial purpose of being the answer to all of CSGO’s problems, then you’re just left with a cartoonish version of CSGO, that is easier to play/takes less skill.

1588199964,2020-04-29,"Going to get downvoted to hell, so I've switched accounts here. I really feel like almost all of this is wrong. Being someone who's played all these games for hours upon hours, as varying as they may be, I really believe that this idea that VALORANT is just a cross between games is wrong. Let's start with Fortnite. I don't see how this game is like Fortnite at all. Fortnite is a battle royale third person shooter which revolves around your ability to build. Not sure where that applies to a tactical and strategic based FPS with no building and no battle royale gamemode. TF2 is another one I don't understand. How does the game play like TF2? We'll ignore pubs and focus on the competitive 6v6 gamemode, which revolves around 2 scours 2 sollys 1 demo 1 med, where the typical gamemode is 5CP. These matches revolve around fast movement whilst also being able to both correctly position yourself and then read the enemies plays. The midfights that occur are very much one big scrap around a point with people juking each other, and if you've ever seen it you'll know what I mean, and how none of TF2 plays out as a slow and methodical game. TF2 has a lot of strategy in it, but none of that could ever be applied to VALORANT. Rainbow 6 - I see this compared a lot more than the previous 2, but still don't understand why. R6 is slow and methodical like VALORANT, but the only two things that the two have in common is the ability to aim down sights and that both games revolve around information. Even then, these two things in common are very much a stretch. The sights are rarely used in VALORANT, whereas in R6, anything that's not Infront of you you'll shoot looking down sights. The sights themselves are very different. The way the game plays is very different, with one game being about attackers slowly flushing out roamers to gain control of an area whereas the other game is about directly hitting a site and then holding it or playing map control to give yourself more options. The way information is acquired is also very different, with R6S getting information via a drone that must play stealthily to ensure that it gets what it needs and not be destroyed, whereas information from VALORANT is a simple ability that can be placed down or launched in a bow. The two games again play very differently and have little similarities. Overwatch. The game has abilities. VALORANT has abilities. The two games abilities are very different in their usage. Overwatch's abilities are a key to success, as are VALORANTs. However, the difference here is about the way the game plays out. The abilities are designed to counter other characters abilities, which is why matches have constantly changing characters. Players can freely change their hero as much as they'd like in overwatch, so if their tracer is melting your team, maybe you'd go McCree to counter her. She sees this, and decides to swap off to another hero to try play against you. The game is constantly changing, and you keep trying to outplay the enemies picks. VALORANTs team composition is NOT around countering the other teams picks. It's about building a team that compliments each other. The fact that you can't swap mid game makes it this way. VALORANT dosent have hard counters or really any counters. VALORANT simply dosent play like overwatch does. However, there is one game that it does. CSGO is very similar to VALORANT. Can't deny that. The gunplay, the movement, it's all very CS like. Which personally, I'm fine with. It is CSGO with a different take. Everything else feels entirely unique, the abilities, the fights and the strategy. At its core, it's CSGO, but the extra details make it play like an entirely different game. I'm a big fan of both. However, I'm not converting to VALORANT. I still find CS more fun. I just really hate all the VALORANT hate coming from the CS community, it feels really unwarranted. -Just so I can show I know what I'm talking about, here's some stats from the games I've played: -CSGO - 2k hours, MM rank is Supreme, Faceit level 6, ESEA B- -Overwatch - (Not sure how many hours) Diamond DPS and Support, Masters on Tank, been playing since S1. -TF2 - 1.8K hours, a lot of experience in 6s and Highlander. -Fortnite - Have to say I haven't played this as much as the others. Played from S1-S3, then the game kinda got boring. Still watch the occasional game or two, but haven't played it since. -R6S - Haven't played since August 2019, but was consistently Plat 2/Plat 3 and had a 50% winrate in ESL tournaments. Of course, this is all just my opinion. I love CS and VALORANT, and I don't see why the two communities can't get along. The games are both fun and unique in their own ways.

(in case this is confusing, I have some insight here: In CS:GO you move your character by applying force using the directional keys (WASD or the like), this means that you aren't directly in control of your speed, but rather indirectly affecting it. Now in order to shoot precisely you need to stand still, but when you let go of the directional keys, you do not stop immediately, but rather drift on for a while as your character loses momentum it has gained. You can drastically lower this period by 'counterstrafing' - pressing a key to move in the opposing direction which counteracts the movement of your character allowing you to regain weapon accuracy faster. When you strafe with A/D it is fairly easy to do so, simply press the other key to stop, but when you run with both say W and A at the same time, to do so would mean pressing both S and D making it way more difficult and unreliable.

Look up the specs for your keyboard and see how many keys it has for “roll-over”, if it’s n-key that means it can handle every key at the same time.

Just yesterday, I (a measly silver 2) got matched against SMEs and GN2s which just sucks. Low to mid silver games are riddled with smurfs and returning players who have deranked, which is stucky for us who are now getting deranked because of this stuff. Be lucky if everyone in our team has mics even With managing toxicity the main things to do is turn down your voice scale and bind a button to mute everybody. Both of these are console commands. To adjust the voice scale (how loud team comms are), put into the console ""voice_scale"" followed by 0-1 based on how high you want it (I have mine between 0.5-0.75 most of the time. To bind a button to mute everybody, bind a button to the commtand ""voice_enable_toggle. I've set mine to the 'u' key, so I put ""bind u voice_enable_toggle"" into the console. This will mean that whenever they're spamming the mic or yelling at you in a clutch, you can hit the button and get on with it. Just remember to unmute when you're done ... that's if you want to at least A very important thing with managing toxicity is to not, under any circumstances, be toxic back. If they team kill your other teammates and even you, they'll get kicked sooner or later for too many kills or damage. Even if they're getting in your way, blocking you, sit back, wait for either them to stop or the other team to come and kill you all. Ultimately, toxicity relies on a response and a reaction, and if you give them none them they might stop. Also, if you manage to lower your trust factor, your games will become more and more toxic, so it's important that you don't if you want to get out of this For me, staying cool usually involves staying silent unless you really need to comm something. If you need to, individually mute people on your team who never give any info, and make sure you mute the enemy team so if they send toxic stuff you don't see it. My mindset usually revolves around that even if my teammates are bad, it doesn't make you any worse of a player. You'll need to play the game on a more individual level, going for picks (not crazy ones tho), solo-holding sites, etc, and relying on you and only yourself as much as you can. You still need to play somewhat as a team tho, but you'll need to be more flexible. Me myself am a b player, but half the time I have to play a because three go b every round. And I've won a lot of 1vX situations in toxic teams because I've just stopped, hit my mute key, focused on the game and played, just like I know I can. At the end of the day, you can't really play as a team if they're not either. And if they're playing only on an individual level, you still should try play as a team, but don't rely on anyone unless you have to. At the end of the day, you've proven that your better than your rank tells, and sure, they're bringing you down now, but you'll get a break one day, maybe even using something like ESEA or FaceIt might be the solution for you, even temporarily until you can solo comfortably get out of silver. Just remember, like a lot of people out there, even me to an extent, you've got what's needed to keep climbing the ladder that is matchmaking. I know this is a long message, but I hope it helps.",0.088,0.787,0.125,0.9563,2

You also have to consider that a lot of people who have invested thousands of hours into CS are bored of it, and would like to get a fresh breath of air with the abilities in Valorant (I might be wrong, some people may disagree with me here).

It's like trying to mix water and oil together. It doesn't go along. Proof of that is that every main issues (like I've already pointed out) of the game derive from one problem : Trying to mix abilities with CS:GO. And of course CS:GO tweaks stuff around, but the main difference is that they're trying to solve a solvable equation, but Riot is trying so hard to solve the unsolvable. ""However, about the abilities, it is actually a great feature imo (once the balance is set). Riot basically takes Overwatch's approach but makes it more tactical (since Overwatch is just a giant mess of abilities and no skill required whatsoever, I hate *that* specifically)."" The abilities can't be a good feature since it creates so many big unsolvable problems. I've never played OW so I can't speak about it. ""You also have to consider that a lot of people who have invested thousands of hours into CS are bored of it, and would like to get a fresh breath of air with the abilities in Valorant (I might be wrong, some people may disagree with me here). So again, balancing is key, and once they nail that they have a great game in their hands (Also Raze is fucking OP, should be removed entirely, but that is just me lmao)."" Trust me nobody is bored of CS:GO. It's like saying that people are bored of football, just because it's been around for hundreds of years. If the game is good and has no realistically reachable skill ceiling, it'll be around forever. And again Valorant by nature can't be balanced. Do you want to know what is tactical hardcore shooter that's balanced? CS. Simply CS. But, if Riot doesn't come with something ""original"" it'll be hard to sell the game, so they've had to add abilities which was the dumbest thing ever. If Valorant had only utilities just like CS it'll be the best game out of the two, because all the problems mentioned before wouldn't exist and the game will actually be owned by a company that really cares about their games...",0.142,0.73,0.128,-0.8715,2

This feature allows you to pre aim angles with the scope in and just delete anyone that stands in your death line.

Anyway, I dug a little deeper myself. I've attempted the following and problem still exists: * turn off CPU virtualization in the BIOS * disabled GSync in the NVidia drivers * disabled FreeSync on my monitor * disabled XMP profile for my RAM * turned off my overclocked profile in MSI Afterburner, GPU is now running per factory/stock * performed a Windows Memory Diagnostic with no errors * reinstalled Steam * reinstalled CS:GO * crash has occurred on maps de_chlorine, de_infurno, de_vertigo, de_anubis - possible related to defuse maps?

And the answer to your second question, I really don't know an accurate answer but to guess, Turks mostly play CS as crews, at least with 4 people. And they are probably gonna bully the fifth player because there is literally 4 Turks and a perfect environment to bully the fifth guy. But maybe that is not the case.

Idk if it counted that or if I just had this cool down pending beforehand. I understand that in some circumstances kicking teammates would be bad, like kicking low skill teammates and not giving them the opportunity to grow (which I don’t do). However, I feel like the current implementation this feature encourages players to keep the cheaters on their team. As it currently stands, at least from what I have heard from players in game, right now cheaters are able to use .lua scripts to completely avoid Ow and bans.

Download DDU from here: [https://www.wagnardsoft.com/content/display-driver-uninstaller-ddu-v18025-released](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.wagnardsoft.com/content/display-driver-uninstaller-ddu-v18025-released) 2. Download Nvidia Graphics drivers 442.74 from here: [https://www.geforce.com/drivers](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.geforce.com/drivers)(make sure to enter the correct details of your graphics card) 3. open DDU, there should be a prompt for you to restart in safe mode, click to restart in safe mode. If a prompt does not pop up, press your windows key + R and type in msconfig. Head over to boot and select safe boot with the option minimal ticked. then restart your PC 4. Once in safe mode open DDU and click the clean and restart, let DDU do its thing and you should reboot into windows again. If you did not reboot into windows and instead are still in safe mode, go back to msconfig and go over into boot and untick safe boot and restart. 5. once back into windows go to where ever you saved your graphics driver 442.74 and click on it to install. from there everything should go back to normal and you should be able to play CSGO at above 200 fps! If this helped you please comment that it helped so others can see this thanks. 📷 GLHFfound it on community discussions on steam, im trying it rn u can do it without the ddu just uninstall the driver you have and install the 442.74",0.02,0.834,0.146,0.9858,1

Right eye peeking 4.) Bunny hop tutorial. Dont have to hit the hops but you HAVE to be able to jump and let go of W key and use A + (move mouse left) =OR= D + (move mouse right) to gain speed. YES, you GAIN SPEED while you are midair and 'syncing your movement with mouse movement. In other words on the ground you move 250 with knife out but if you jump + synch movement you can go faster than that 250 speed cap. 5.) Plant vs after plant spots. How to play a 1v1 when the bomb is down and you are a T. So when you plant the bomb, your plant spot should be dictated by where you will try to hide afterwards. Be close enough that you can hear the defuse kit beep when they start the defuse. Wait 3 seconds then peek out (usually you move only a few steps because of good positioning) then shoot them in the face ORRRRRRR get them to shoot one bullet or move 1 step. You will either kill them or get them off the defuse. If they get off the defuse you need to jump back into cover and just wait till you hear the beep again, wait 3s, then do the same thing. This will both kill the most amount of time, make you harder to deal with, and give you the best chance of winning. If you are the CT you should understand this is how you 'optimally' play the situation, and either bring a smoke to defuse with or try to just sneakily kill the last T by making a good guess on where he wants to hide given a certain plant spot. 6.) Know how to trade kills. And position well. DO NOT be a baiter. Dont watch your teammate die or wait for your teammate to move before you do so you can bait him. TRADING kills is different than BAITING for kills. In rare situations a bait might be worth it but you wont be to this level of play until much much later so dont bait! 7.) Learn how to running right click toss a flash bang and have it land behind you when you are peeking out. You can use flashbangs with right click + (forward momentum) running in almost every situation. Lets say you are on inferno at the top of middle pushing as a T. You can throw the flash bang right click while running to the right side of top mid, then peek out and look to the left (with good timing, takes 3s to pop) and force your opponent to either try to fight you while blind or look away while you peek into them. 8.) DO NOT open crates. Want a weapon? Save your $$$ and buy it. Dont be that dumbf\*ck kid who tries to rationalize burning 99% of his $$$ because 'its fun to gamble hurrrrrr'. So many f\*cking morons in this community get hooked on gambling, and lose a shit load of money and end up spending sooo much and getting essentially nothing in return. Want a skin? BUY IT.

In After Effects and Premiere, you can press F9 to 'easy ease' your keyframes which makes them look much smoother. Vegas has an equivalent to this you can use by right clicking your keyframes and choosing the option you want. Here's a [video](https://vimeo.com/5936542) explaining, but really it's just 'fast' 'slow' etc. But it will make any keyframing look a lot smoother. This will definitely improve the flow of the edits. And yeah, CC a lot of the time comes down to personal preference. I use Magic Bullet Looks, which is a plugin for both AE and Vegas.

1594923816,2020-07-16,"I tested 9 accounts First account I played normally on deathmatch without pressing Windows key while the character is moving. I played Wingman, there are no cheaters at all. Second account, I played on deathmatch and press Windows key while the character is moving for 1 times. I played Wingman, there are wallers. Third account, I played on deathmatch and press Windows key while the character is moving for 10 or more times. I played Wingman, there are spinbotters ready to hvh The rest of the accounts that I test repeat the processes above and found accurate result. So in conclusion: Short explanation: Running, jumping or walking while instantly clicking windows key or alt+tab will instantly wrongfully cause low trust factor in any gamemodes except workshop map. Long explanation: Whenever the character CSGO has any form of movement momentum such as jump run or walk. The momentum is still lingering. While the momentum is still ongoing and the user click windows key simultaneously, the character will have movement while CSGO is tab out to Windows. Vacnet will then assume that user has a walkbot because there are still movements momentum while CSGO is being tab out. Vacnet will then wrongfully put user in low trust factor. This happen in both full screen and borderless windows. Usually, this problem can occur if player accidently click Windows key while their character is moving. So my solution right now is to disable Windows and Alt+Tab keys while in CSGO. After that, my trust factor go back to green and never met any cheaters and recently got a rank up.

Walkbot will automatically move your character automatically. It is a tool for people who want to get to level 2 fast to play competitive or simple generic tool for derankers. Usually, 99% of the time, users who possess walkbot have cheat. Vacnet will detect any movement while CSGO is close or tab out via alt+tab or Windows key. For example, if you are able to move around and headshot people while CSGO is being tab out, which is impossible which mean you 100% have walkbot and aimbots. Valve will detect movements or aim movements while CSGO is being tab out which is a great feature to bring these kind of people to low trust. BUT Valve made a huge mistake. When you press aswd to move or you press spacebar to jump. You still have some movement lingering left. You don't instantly stop while when you lift your finger from aswd. And, you certainly won't stop and freeze on mid air when you are jumping. Valve then mistakenly detect these lingering movements and wrongfully believe that the user is using walkbot when user press alt+tab or Windows key to tab out of CSGO. That's is what trigger low trust factor. Remember, alt+tab or Windows key alone won't bring you to low trust, you have to have movement via aswd or jumping in mid-air and instantly simultaneously press alt+tab or Windows key to trigger low trust. The more times you do that, the more trust factor penalties you will receive. Valve please fix",0.086,0.764,0.15,0.9741,1

I would recommend you to: 1- Adjusting your video settings, trying to get the maximum framerate that you can 2-Seeing if your aspect ratio suits you, for example I play on 4:3 and its much easier for me 3-I would warm up 20-30 Minutes against bots in a custom game. There's a lot of different custom maps made for practicing. First practice doing One taps on the head, so you get used to flicking between targets, then focus on spraying enemies, learn the pattern of the Ak-47, giving 20-30 minutes every day to practice will make your skills skyrocket. 4-I would focus on some maps (1-3 maps and focus on them), pick the maps that tou like the most, and focus in learning how to correctly play it: -For example if you play CT Inferno, learn to play a single site, and then the other. Start by learning how to control the Banana so the enemy doesnt rush, for example by throwing a molotov against the wall close range(On banana right after the barrels) and then following it with a nade, then falling back to site and waiting for the enemy team to push, so then you smoke it off and waste a lot of time for the enemy. That's just an example. Playing intelligently is the key. And learning how to correctly utilize utility is a life changer. 5-Playing premade will make you not get frustrated so much, and will make it quite easier to defend and atack in synch.

Means, by just pressing ALT+F9 on your keyboard, your screen will start recording if you are inside the game. Shadowplay is really good since it gives great quality output video. Now if you u are not using Nvidia and you u are using AMD, i think they have a similar recording software too, just google it because i use Nvidia. And there is no watermark or anything. Check my video in my profile, you will see how good it is. Now remember, this is only for recording your video. If you want to edit, then use Adobe Premiere Pro or Sony Vegas Pro. Both are paid software but you can download it from torrents for free (I know it's not the most ethical thing to do). I use Premiere Pro and it's pretty good.

It's Contraband so there is literally no way to increase the supply. With CSGO re-surging in popularity the demand for this skin in particular is almost guaranteed to increase. My reasoning behind this is simple economics: Supply will steadily be decreasing. Sure, some collectors might try and cash out to profit on it. But, the CS community is currently stronger than ever according to steamcharts, meaning, there are people trying CSGO for the first time and eventually they will come across skins. The first 2 **GUN** skins that most new CSGO players learn about are the Dragon Lore and the Howl. Both legendary skins, key difference being that it is still possible to unbox a Dragon Lore, even if the starting price for a Cobblestone souvenir package is about $470 USD on the steam market. Even if only 10% of these new players ever start seriously trading and buying skins, that a rather large increase in demand with an already limited supply. This clearly indicates to me that the price for a Howl will rise in the long term and probably significantly so. Obviously there is risk involved. The biggest risk and only *loosely* plausible one is: Valve being Valve they could decide to release a new CS game at any point, bringing a new skin based economy with it which would tank the CSGO economy. But I don't see them abandoning an entire multi-million (potentially billion) dollar economy that they created. If a new CS comes out Valve will likely transfer the skins to the new game in order to avoid alienating part of the player base, but also because its a large revenue stream for them. IF they released a new CS and tried to start a new economy all over again, people would be weary and not invest nearly as much in the new skins as they did with CSGO because they would have seen what happened with CSGO skins. That's also ignoring the possibility that it becomes a 1.6 vs Source split again, but that's a whole other topic that would make things much more intricate.

If you are motivated to play cs you can do it but be aware that there are many things that valve hasnt fixed yet like cheaters and boosting services. If you are to do what i said then you could get somebody to play with or play solo which i dont actually enjoy its your choice after all , in your way up to level 21 be sure to only play scrimmage maps and avoid being toxic or making people angry its for fun so dont rage , also you should try to find your favourite weapon in-game like rifle(ak or m4) or an awp depending on you which is better for you , try aim_botz map you could search it on the internet and download it , you can also search on youtube about daily rutines and styles of training your raw aim , you must aim at the head to kill someone faster so make sure you got the reflexed , training is key in this game so you could train like 30mins a day and try to get better aim. After you have prime you become to know more about the game and know what is your rank and your goal , depending on your goal you can either become a casual player or a better and better one make sure to grind alot , one day you will make a faceit account since matchmaking is bad and doesnt represent skill at all or it does but rarely. You need to train before you play to be better , after that you can play more or not your choice but if you feel that you play worse than last time you need to train and also another thing about the game you must speak english in game , communication is key in game , in serious matches you need to say any piece of information that can help you win the game or round.

1597844175,2020-08-19,"Playing CSGO on a laptop with Intel HD 620 graphics isn't going to provide a great playing experience, but there are game settings to make it much more playable. I just spent a few hours setting up CSGO to run 30fps on an old Dell Inspiron with an older version of Intel HD graphics. Once you get Steam and CSGO installed run CSGO and go into the game menu and enable the console. Once enabled activate the console by pressing the ` key. Enter the command net_graph 1 and it will display the frames per second, ping, and other game information. This can be turned off with net_graph 0 in console. To get more FPS try the following settings and system maintenance. On the computer take a look at the power plan and make sure it is set to maximum performance. Play CSGO with the laptop plugged in and not while on the laptop battery. You might want to update the Intel graphics driver. In the Intel graphics menu look for settings that say prefer max performance over quality. I don't know anything about Linux Mint, but hopefully its a lot less bloated than windows and doesn't have tons of back ground processes running. You might want to look into Linux OS specific tutorials to get the system running better. You would probably see the biggest improvement from using a SSD instead of a HDD. It would load maps faster but wouldn't help with FPS unless your system is struggling with memory and causing HDD activity that would cause hitching during gameplay when a system is struggling with performance. In the game menu go to Video settings and set the resolution to the lowest setting possible just to see if the FPS improves. Most players use a lower resolution anyway because it increases FPS and makes it easier to get headshots in the game in my opinion. Set all the graphics settings on low. Try using multithreaded on and see if it helps improve the FPS. Disable vsync. Go through the mouse settings and set mouse acceleration to off to keep a constant and consistent mouse movement to better develop muscle memory for repeatable aim. Set the mouse sensitivity to something you are comfortable with. I usually set mine to where if I jump and move the mouse a comfortable distance I land exactly 180 degrees facing the opposite direction. Then over time I decrease it slightly to improve forward fine aim control. There is a lot more to mouse sensitivity, but I'm assuming you don't have a gaming mouse. If you do then you will have to try out different DPI and Polling values and see what works best for you. I also recommend setting the crosshair to be a dot and not a crosshair and making it static and not dynamic. Then learn how to tap and burst the rifles for recoil control and how to pull down the recoil pattern for each rifle. If CSGO is still only playing around 30 FPS there are more advanced things you can do to try to get the best experience possible playing CSGO on integrated Intel HD graphics, but I would recommend doing a google search and following a FPS tutorial for CSGO. It will give you a list of more advanced launch option commands in Steam that do actually work. The goal is at least 30 to 60 FPS. Get a lightweight gaming headset that has a hardware mute switch like mute when rotating the mic boom up. This game is all about sound. Where are the foot steps and where are fire fights happening. It is possible to actually play CSGO on a laptop with Intel Integrated HD graphics, but it takes some effort to get playable FPS. Good luck.",0.042,0.806,0.152,0.9974,6

Honestly swamp/mutiny are really well made maps. 2.) Practice counterstrafing. Learn that first. 3.) Watch 'war owl : perspectives' video on youtube. 4.) Learn how to bunny hop. You dont have to learn how to hop but you should be in the habit of letting go of ""W"" when you are airborne and using A/D and mouse to strafe / turn (because you literally gain speed in the air if you airstrafe properly). 5.) Learn about 'right eye peeking'. 6.) Practice Team Death Match every single day to learn mechanics and get your counterstrafing down. 7.) USE TEAMWORK when you play casual or scrims. If youre a terrorist you should 100% of the time be going with your team. Dont be that dumbf#ck kid who blows d#ck at the game and thinks hes 'too good' to go with the team. Seriously. Just go with the team. If you die by a teammate he can get a 'trade kill' and your death wont be for nothing. If youre off doing god knows what on the other side of the map, your death is meaningless, and your kills are meaningless. So BE A TEAMMATE. This isnt call of f#cking duty. Its CSGO: A TEAM GAME. 8.) Set up an 'autoexec.cfg'. In there you should bind jump to both mouse wheel and spacebar, have a quickswitch button for Q (not mandatory, but recommended), and have a jump+throw bind for grenade lineups. You should learn how to code a little bit. Dont worry, its not hard at all. Seriously 0/10 difficulty, and most of the sh#t you learn is easily found on google or youtube. You should also have grenades individually bound. Dont be that dopey f#ck who has scroll wheel for 99% of their inventory. I use mousewheel up for pulling knife out, and mousewheel down for jumping so I can do a lot of movement tricks with just my mouse wheel and mouse (and A/D on my keyboard when Im airborne). Hopefully you have a mouse that has some buttons on the side. 1 should be for push to talk, and the other for like... smoke grenade. 9.) Speakin a which, always buy a smoke grenade. Its OP as f#ck. Also learn how to right click grenades. Watch a video on how to use flashbangs. 10.) Make an grenade practice .cfg file. So you can open console and type in 'exec smoke' and it will set up an offline bot match to have infinite grenades and such. (youtube will help you here). Just practice throwing flashbangs and peeking with them, and throwing smokes into certain spots, and how to use right click nades. And left+right click to 'medium toss' nades. And how to jump and throw a nade while you are moving upwards to make your trajectory change into a more upwards one (really good with right click nades). Same is true with movement. When you throw a grenade you HAVE TO be walking exactly forward ONLY when you toss nades. 11.) If you like a certain map, learn a few smoke lineups. Takes no skill to learn, just memorization. Your jump throw bind will come in handy here. Some lineups need jumpthrow.",0.117,0.801,0.082,-0.9778,1

As one of the key players of ‚P90Fuckers‘ I only can recommend to use the weapon at some point. My buddies and me introduced the cache p90 b rush tactic and this worked better than we ever expected. We won between 12-8 rounds per match for t-side, because most ppl, even in higher ranks like mge or dmg did not know how to stop us. Instead of handling us they were crying:“mimi noob weapon“. I was always surprised, because after the second rush these players could have been prepared. As a bonus, the enemies started to hate each other, if they lose against 5 man p90 rush. The conclusion: The p90 is actually a highly situative weapon and will work worse with every rank you earn (till DMG, but not higher).

1602491815,2020-10-12,"Simply becoose is has the most refined gameplay. Is a game how the time you putting in to memorize maps. To learn weapon patterns and smoke are matter. There are no equals to experience ins this game no noob protection and least amount of rng you can get in a shooter. And if you ever get a one deag in a 1v1 wen it stands 15-14 for you team you will understand the beauty of this game. Csgo will teasch you every thing you need to know about shooter 1. Recoil management simple maintain a low dpi about between 800 and 1200 effective dpi some main awps used to play high dpi but I do not recommend being a main AWP if you do not play with 4 of you're friends losing an AWP can lose a game sometimes. You will learn how to analyse and abuse the strength of a weapon recoil patterns in cs are not Radom if you stand still but most of the time 3 shots should be enough for a enemy. you will carve the patterns of you're weapons into you're muscle memory so you will reasch a point how you can truly trust you're aim 2. Economie you will learn to manage the money and hp pool you have since you only have 100 hp a useless rush will come at a cost. The management of weapon armorand utility like smoke and flashes comes to play. 3. Map arwareness comes to play memoryzing angles and vision lines on maps you will slowly build up a spider sense to a point how you can read the enemy. 4. Communication since csgo is a team game you will and need learn to communicate with them. Making clear call outs and only telling what you know not what you thing all b wen you only see 3 players are not a good call I might will open a crack in the defensive of you're team. Call what you will do request for eco rounds or stacks say what position you want to play. So you don't end up with a 5 man scout stack on middle. 5. Mind games sometimes you will encounter enemy's how have a same skills as you that are usually most fun games becoose both teams have to do some tricks like taking a push on some point or double triple faking. The hardes mind games a 1v2 situation how you have to make noise to distract them or fake flash by trowing Ur pistol becoose you have no flashgenades left. Man reading the enemy is a big part of cs After you master all this you will be able shine in most fps and surpass the most player with ez. Becoose you not only rely on your aim but also at your skill to turn a situation in you're favour by manypolating you're fight with position and desition making. That's the reason why most csgo players a feart on fpsgames. Don't be to harsh to u self at the start we all were silver strash for sometime. But if you a wild to improve you will quickly realise that cs refined to fps skills. To archive the get gud every body is talking about I recommend watching warowl guides on YouTube he explains everything about cs go you need to know I can understand every player how say I don't want to spend several hundred hours to archive that get gud. And for them are the casual shooters like cod and battlefield but there have a loot of rng in terms of patterns and a high ttk. Since most of them are only required a fast reflextime. There guns king of feel all the same and poorly have character. At least some Tipps to get started with cs 1. Play low dpi 2. Play with a static crosshair 3. Use you're shift key to walk without sound and get a headset to hear that rhinos 4. Watch you're economie don't buy AWP if there all ready one on you're team 5. Smokes are not walls player and bullets can surpass them 6. Make call outs and learn the names of positions. 7. Don't dead talk if you die call what's kills you and there like 1 CT apps mag-7. Give usefully Infos if 5 enemy's are alive the position of that guy is more important that that you made 50 damage to him. Never dead talk like is bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb. Is likely youre teammates have a headset to. Mute people how give trash call or dead talk to mutch( not the hol map is callt ct^^ ) 8. If you're thing somebody might cheats report them and than play you're best, guys with walls can usually be ez baited in a bad position becoose the want to get that essay kill. Don't talk with cheaters questions his mother origins will not make him stop. 9. Switch position don't do the same shit every round 5 man banane etc the enemy will adapt to that and ez prefire you.

I stopped playing for 4-5 years, came back, forgot how to really play. The game even looks and feels different. Needless to say, I wasn't LEM anymore. To my credit, I am playing WiFi and hit registry varies with it. It started me at MG2 and kids I played w/ were saying I must have gotten boosted :D I remember playing the original CS in beta pre-steam. Back then there were WONIDs (World Opponent Network) and I didn't even have the game. A friend lent me their CDKey, but you could also use CDKey Cracks -- that's how simple and stupid the tech was back then. My IDs were low when I finally purchased. We would play it after school. Some kids that knew how to hack would be perusing WindowsXP code for an admin password or opening... they eventually got it and were able to install the game on school computers. Nothing beat those days when you would go home, play CS for a few hours on original Dust, and then rag on your friends for camping the dugout near spawn. A few of those kids went pro-am. Not me. I was better than some, but with WiFi 802.11B back then, it was always another wrench in the wheel of reliability. Today, with enough coffee or the right amount of booze, some things come back. At this age, how you sit in your chair (using sidearm or sitting forward) can make all the difference. That said, I bought a new account to try and work my way up. I can't even join a competitive match (as a 5-man or solo) even with setting ping to 250. When I do join a match (after 20 mins) it ends up being HVH and I'm at a lost.

For example if a new collection of skins drop out the prices might go up or down, since people will use the market more etc. If you sell the skin via steammarket the money will go to into your steam wallet. People often want their money on their bank so what you can do is sell it outside the steammarket. If people add you and ask you stuff about your knife, just don't bother, ignore them since they will never offer you anything in your interest (or it's just a scam attempt most of the times).

This looks like a skin that you might find in a map collection, and I think it lacks the personality of most of the well-established skins that are around these days. When making a skin, think about what color themes people might use them for, or if they would go well with other existing skins. The main thing I think this skin needs is a personality, right now it's just a design (which is cool, don't get me wrong) but it needs something unique... some of the best skins in the game like the kill confirmed or the dragon lore have cool designs, but they have a central feature that the design revolves around and that gives it it's name. That's the key to getting a featured skin, if that's what you are going for: good color themes, and a personality. Some ideas: if you are going for a water/wave effect, maybe draw something in the middle that is making the waves. If your design is like the inside of a clam shell, with a pearly texture, maybe put a shell texture on the fringes of your skin. You could put something special, like words or a sea creature, on the clip or the body. Other nice skins with designs such as this have those defining features, like the aquamarine revenge.

CSGO is a game that you can dedicate 1,000's of hours learning about the game and still not have it all figured out. 1. Play DM's on active rotation to get a feel for map layouts before hopping straight into competitive 5 mans. 2. Don't label yourself as a certain role on your team if you are solo queuing. (Ex. Entry fragger, awper, support player) 3. Start with a small amount of maps selected when you play 5 mans to allow yourself to learn strats a little faster. 4. This game isn't cod or battlefield. Playing the objective and contributing to the overall team goal is what is most important. Don't let yourself get down in the dumps just because you aren't top frag. 5. Learn a few key smokes and flash bangs to assist your team. (Yprac's map guides on the steam workshop are an excellent place to start learning lineups.) 6. Play some community servers! There are so many fun things to do like surfing, bunny hopping, and kz that will help you improve the way you move in game. 7. HAVE FUN and take the game at your own pace. All of the tips I have put above are no where near mandatory. At the end of the day, CS will be what you make it. You can take it serious or just relax and have fun. After playing CS for almost 15 years now, I have found that there has to be a balance. If you aren't progressing your skills then the game can become very monotonous playing the same maps over and over. Hope this helps some, I don't have all the answers by any means.

1609019512,2020-12-26,"Hey Spacious, I'm sorry to hear you've been dealing with this for so long. The shoulder is a pretty complex joint, and there's a lot that can go on to cause pain there. I'm not saying this to say ""I can't help you"", just to let you know that I'm going to answer as best I can, but I'll be limited because I can't do a full evaluation. I'm going to answer this with the assumption that it's your mouse shoulder that's hurting, since you mentioned changing sens, but let me know if that's not the case. First, the fact that strengthening exercises help you does suggest that stability, motor control, and coordination are playing some part in your injury. That doesn't help us narrow it down much--there's a lot that can cause those impairments--but it does give us an important data point about what helps you, specifically. Second, the fact that this pain only comes on while gaming is like a big red neon sign saying ""something about your setup isn't supporting you well"". Even with really solid stability and motor control, your muscles will fatigue over time. I know you've said you've tried quite a few postures, but the key things I'd suggest you look out for are 1. Is your arm abducted out to the side, with a lot of space between your elbow and ribs? 2. Is your shoulder elevated (shrugged up towards your ear) or depressed (usually happens when you have to slouch down to the height of your armrests)? 3. Do you use your armrests regularly, or are you stabilizing your arm only with your muscles? Ideally, your forearm should be supported on your armrest, relatively close to your side, with your shoulders relaxed but not slouched down. Third, you mentioned trying dry needling. Dry needling is a pretty specific intervention for trigger point release, and while it can help with relieving a trigger point, it doesn't necessarily address the issue causing the trigger point in the first place. We tend to get trigger points when a muscle is overworked and the load or strain isn't distributed well across a number of muscle groups (which ties back to my original statement about stability, motor control, and coordination being involved). There's a statement in medicine that ""when you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras."" The ""horse"" in this case would be a muscular issue involving weakness or lack of endurance in some of the scapular and mid/upper back muscles; this would not be something any of us could diagnose/address for certain without an assessment.

1609103894,2020-12-27,"First things first: focus primarily on raw mechanics in the beginning. This means: Main weapons (this guide does not cover AWP, as it is more situational, and i would encourage all players without any exceptions to learn how to play rifles to at least a Master Guardian level before grapping the AWP), spray patterns, movement and firing, common weapon knowledge, economy, Pre-aiming and pre-firing, map control vs. rushing, hitboxes and damage multipliers and basics of utility usage. Main Weapons: Start out by learning AK-47 and M4A4 (i'd suggest this one, as it is my opinion that it is superior to A1), glock and USP-S. These are the weapons that win the game. The SMGs and snipers might win rounds but rifles win games! They are not in any way situational, and it is important to know how they work, which will be broken down a bit more further down. Youtube can also help a lot. Keywords for youtubing this subject could be: rifles, spray patterns, movement, strafing and counterstrafing. Worth noting in this subject: CTs default pistols (P2000 and USP-S) are 1 headshot kills, which the glock isn't (both only on enemy without helmet). AK-47 are 1 headshot kill as well, even helmeted. M4A4 and A1 are not. Always pick up an AK over an M4 at round end. always! Spray Patterns: All guns have spray patterns and spread. This is what inaccuracy is made of. Spread consists of two important factors: bullet inaccuracy and first bullet inaccuracy, but first you need to know the ""ranking"" of inaccuracy. Your accuracy increases when doing anything that is ***not*** being crouched and sitting still while firing one bullet at a time. Standing up: decreases accuracy ever so slightly, movement: decreases accuracy drastically on rifles and snipers, but less on SMGs and basically not on shotguns, jumping: fucks the aim of anything else than shotguns and MP9 and Mac-10, being on a latter: fucks aim on anything else than shotguns and revolver, etc. Spray pattern is a set pattern that the bullets after the first one goes in. These are always the same.... but. The but is spread. First bullet inaccuracy exists, which means that if you are far enough away from a subject, you are not guaranteed to land the shot, regardless of weapon and crouching. Example: you are not accurate enough with a rifle to consistently be able to shoot a guy in Dust2's A site when you are in pit if using a rifle, even if the crosshair is on him. All bullets have inaccuracy, meaning that even though the spray pattern is the same, where the bullets land will differ from spray to spray. Even taking this into consideration, learning (or just knowing in the beginning) the spray pattern will help tremendously. Movement and firing: Has been mentioned under spray pattern: running fucks your aim. stand still when you fire unless you are using shotguns, SMGs or a pistol that is not Deagle. Common Weapon Knowledge: 1) M4 needs 2 headshots to kill, are more expensive than AK but shoots a bit faster. 2) M4A1-s is silenced: no tracers through smokes to shoot at, shoots at the same rate as AK 3) Glock is basically run'n'gun. USP-S you're better off standing still or crouching 4) Spray patterns of any gun gets smaller when crouched than standing up Economy: Basically: buy when the team all have enough to buy rifles, kevlar and helmet. On CT: 4.100, on T: 3.700. Eco if you cant do that UNLESS you cant buy next round either due to loss bonus: then force. Round loss bonus build up over time: 1 lost round adds 400 to the next rounds bonus for loosing, maxing at 3.400, equating the win bonus before kill rewards. If first round of a half is lost, the loss bonus is 1.800 as the only exception. Weapons do not give the same kill reward: Rifles and P90: 300, SMGs except P90: 600, Shotguns: 900, snipers: less than rifles, i think it is 100, but i cant remember. MOST IMPORTANT: Syncronise your buy rounds, force rounds and eco rounds across the entire team, or you will constantly be at a disadvantage. oh yeah: basically: CT side have a tougher time with economy as they have to buy kit (400), mollies are more expensive at 600 compared to Ts 400 and their rifle is worse and costs 400 more. Pre-aim and Pre-fire: Basically: aim in the head, and always where it is most likely that the next enemy is coming from. If you know an enemys position, you can start firing before you spot him to have an advantage of reaction time. the rest comes with experience and youtube. Map-control vs Rushes: Be syncronised across the team. Giving opponents 1v1 fights are disadvantageous, so peek with a teammate and dont go alone into fights unless you are flashing the opponent. Decide to either go to a site or get map control. Map control grants the knowledge of whether CTs push and the advantage of 2v1 fights if they do, and you are more able to know where you are safe, and where you need to clear corners. Rushes give the advantage of outnumbering CTs as they are only 3 max on a site, due to needing to cover 2 sites. Disadvantage of this is they can use utility and know where you come from, so if you consistently do this, you're in for a world of pain. Damage multipliers and hitboxes: A player is, when it comes to the amount of damage taken, divided into 4 regions: legs, stomach, rest of the torso and head. You take base damage of the weapon minus the distance drop off in damage and minus the kevlars effect on the weapon. Different weapons are absorbed at different rates. Most important to know: Legs do 75% of base damage, torso: 100%, stomach: 125% and head: 400%. this means that headshots are FAR BETTER than anything else, but also that it takes 5 shots to the chest to kill with an M4 but only 4 to the stomach, and the Deagle kills in two shots to the stomach but 3 to the chest. Aim for the head, also when you do not see the opponent. **If you are to only take away one thing from this, let it be: AIM AT HEAD HIGHT - ALWAYS! Not only when in fight.** Basic utility: Smokes block vision, mollies do AOE damage, flashes blind and nades do direct damage. Most important here: use flashes to peak, never to hold back. Use mollies to stop rushes and smokes to stop pushes (read: mollies when you think they'd run through a smoke anyway, but else: smokes). You are always at a major disadvantage when pushing smokes so for the most parts: dont. Or at least accompany it with a flash. Oh and mollies are more expensive for CTs and they need at least a kit or two every round. &amp;#x200B; any questions?",0.16,0.755,0.085,-0.9988,2

1610835194,2021-01-16,"Hey man easiest thing to tell you is a lot of training. Cs is an old game, and therefore skillgap has become high. When that is said though I can give you some small tips that might give you an advantage if you master them. You can't just go push, I know it is fun, but the cover in this game is so essentiel. Try and stay behind cover, and if you need info, perhaps do a jiggle peak (If you do not know what it is, just look it up, it is simple enough). One thing very important as well is to stay as still as posible I can see you are doing it mostly, but just one click on one of the WASD buttons and you're pretty much garanteed to miss. If you peak and when you se the enemy press the opposite key to completely stop momentum. Forexample you can when peaking from the right press A to completely stand still and get a standing accuracy rather than walking. When playing with peek something, try and preaim where they could be. Especially when you know they are there you have to be ready to shoot. In the video there is a situation where you have info where the guy is, but you proceed to peak him without being scoped. I bet if you were scoped it would be an easy kill! Perhaps another crosshair would also drastically improve your skills already. If you like the crosshair then it is great. Crosshair is more about the feeling. If you want a different one you can download crazh's crosshair generator and make your own! It's clear that you're not bad at the game, best you can do is just focus on the small details, since it is the details that often give you a heads up in 1v1's. Also there is always time to improve aim, even for pro's. Aim is the most consitent thing when dealing in 1v1's. There is no point in having a good position if you can't hit your enemy. There is also tons of map, for improving aim. Watching pro's play does also help on the large sceem of aspect. Try to mimic some of their gameplay. Im not talking about their highlights where they push B on dust\_2 alone and get an ace. But try to watch a full game of perhaps your favorite team. Hope you know that I am not trying to roast you, your gameplay does not suggest you're shit out of luck, you got some decent skill, you just need the finesse as well. Have a good day!

You can do this repeatedly back and forth, timing your shots for the precise moment your player model is standing still and has perfect accuracy. The whole advantage of this is to make your player model a moving and unpredictable target, making it difficult for your opponent to hit you reliably. However, the better you get at the game the better you predict where to shoot based on many hours of experience against players who counter-strafe. Playing against someone who doesn’t counter-strafe is confusing because you think they’re going to strafe slightly so you aim a little left or right of them and miss and die. Of course, you won’t win a game not counter-strafing. You’ll just tilt your enemy until they start just shooting straight at you instead of shooting where they think you’ll be.

1612341028,2021-02-03,"I would recommend learning to counter strafe diagonal movement (if you are moving forward with W and right with D, counter it with S and A. Same premises with other diagonal movements.), it can be useful if you get caught off guard. But you really want to limit diagonal movement, it's not necessary all the time, it's rarely necessary. One example where you might use diagonal movement is on Overpass, the Connector Stairs leading down to Connector can be peeked diagonally when trying to clear the first corner. Even then, you don't need diagonal movement to peek it but it would create a faster peek if done correctly. Most of the time, try to just use A and D, counter strafe accordingly. One place you might find yourself moving diagonally, when it's not needed, is Long A on Dust 2 as CT. Let's say no one pushes you Long A (while you are at Long Corner) and you want to clear Double Doors, use W to bring yourself closer to the doors but only so far so that you can use D to clear inside doors while your back is against (close, but not touching) Blue Cargo. There are a few reasons why this is the optimal method to peek Double Doors: 1. While coming closer, with W, you can easily keep your crosshair on the door and easily counter in case an enemy pops out. Crosshair placement and reaction time are key here. 2. If you use D correctly, you will be as far away from Double Doors as you can go (the closer you are to a corner, the easier it is for the enemy to see you first) and be able to quickly counter strafe if you see someone. You will be a much harder target to hit because of your speed and your distance from Double Doors. 3. By doing this, you can quickly peek outside long (specifically the car, where a lot of people wait for CT's to peek) and even throw in a jump if you think someone is at car waiting for you. 4. You are perfectly setup to enter Double Doors (after clearing inside, with your back against Blue Cargo), and should currently be behind the right door closest to CT Side. From this point you can move closer to the right door and quickly strafe to the left door, quickly checking for enemies, and quickly strafe inside with D. This can all be done in one swift motion.

I think the prevalence of these greatly outweigh other cheat modes. aim bot or aim assistance is probably the most easy to hide if configured right. the temptation for players who have vision assistance not to act on the information is pretty hard, I think this catches a lot of new cheaters out, looking at players through walls, acting on information that couldn't be gathered through other players or from audio cues. makes overwatch easier for me lol.",0.165,0.69,0.145,-0.7154,18

Being a good awper is not about being a one-trick, learning to awp is to learn the game AND the awp. Remember, you won't be able to afford the awp every round, so practice your one-taps and one-deags so you can kill and then afford the awp. Sure your teammates can drop you that awp, but your awp is first and foremost ***your responsibility***, especially in matchmaking. So, the best way to learn how to use the long boys are just to learn how to shoot properly, one-tap practice helps a lot. Practice hitting the opposite key of your current movement and shooting at the right time (that split second when you're not moving while changing direction), practice only moving in one direction at a time when possible so you can counter that movement easier, practice good crosshair placement. Learning the awp means learning the entirity of cs + more extra work, it's gonna take a while and requires patience and discipline. But it's a lot of fun once you master it, and that's the most important part of mastering the craft, to have fun. TL;DR : Learn to shoot without the awp before learning to shoot with it. P.S.

1616089977,2021-03-18,"For improving your aim, I would recommend you this: Go to practice with bots (choose medium ,hard or expert bots as per you) and choose any map of your choice. And play deathmatch When you enter the game, open the console. Type this command: mp\_damage\_headshot\_only 1 This will make the bots immune to body damage. And it'll give you a lotta practice Here are some tips to improve your aim: 1. Choose a good weapon and good maps for yourself. I like the sg553 and awp but you can use other rifles too. Don't play all maps. Practice on 3-4 maps and master them. 2. Analyze your spray patterns. In most cases, hold down the left click to spray and drag your mouse downwards as you do it. This is enough to kill upto 2 players at once. 3. Considering mouse settings, I usually don't go for 180 deg. in one sweep. I do like somewhere 90deg to 120deg in one sweep. You can adjust the settings to keep them low as well as comfortable according to you. 4. Considering peeking, make sure to have a good cover when peeking. Use 'A' and 'D' keys to peek at all times. If you feel that there's an enemy awp, don't go for it. In extreme cases, use a smoke or flash to nullify the awper. This won't get you killed. 5. Last but not the least, watch pro players play on [twitch.tv/esl\_csgo](https://twitch.tv/esl_csgo) . That'll give you pretty good idea of the game.

Doing some mechanical work to get used to aiming/recoil and adding some tactical stuff using utility and peeks for certain maps. These things will give you a certain ""base"" in skills. Which will take far longer if you just play MM/wing. So getting this base built up will help you from getting super wrecked. You might still get wrecked but you will be better than a BOT at least.

He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on.

Smokes are okay but not the best.... I wouldn’t recommend smokes unless you know lineups as they can create unfavorable one ways for the awper rather than let you push to them. If you know where ones is jiggle peeking/ air strafing to bait a shot out then molly them is a very good option as it will force them to move (wait 2 seconds to push after a molly lands as some players will yank the damage to try and pick you) in short utility is key in taking down an awper, just pick your poison carefully and learn a few simple lineups. Look to nothings nades for noobs series or someone like nadeking I believe has a lot of videos on this as well.

Some items are too expensive for the steammarket, so my inventory would be valued at 0? There is way too many grey areas here for them to be making anything conclusive. The only way this could work to their favor, is by using data from the account buying in-game items, such as keys, capsules, music kits etc. However, this wouldn´t be flawless as they would just be able to sell these items again.

I’m going to be honest with you: You’re going to get abused so badly you’ll need to shower after you’ve finished. Sadly, once you’ve been whooped worse than Apollo Creed at the hands of Ivan Drago, you’ll realise that matchmaking isn’t enough to improve your skill, and that, just like Rocky, being a punching bag isn't ideal and practice makes perfect. Lets begin! # TRAINING MAPS: All of the best community made (practice) maps are now on Steam Workshop, and you’ll need a few to get yourself going. **Numero Uno:** Download the CSGO Hub training map, [**HERE**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2185699891)**.** It’s a good place to start. Mow down a few hundred bots in rush mode (minimum 4 bots, then once that’s easy go up to 5, and so on). Run-and-gun in the obstacle course with various weapons to get used to aim-tracking and practice pre-aim on the competitive map runs. This map also has a ton of crosshairs to choose from (since the default is terrible). Speaking of crosshairs, here's mine: CSGO-pZJ3f-FP6qu-jyTxu-i9nLx-AUc3K It dynamically adjusts, slightly, only to remind you that you need to apply spray control and to slow down your fire-rate when shooting over distance. It's all personal choice, again. Choose from a few and see which works for you. **Dos, Tres... Veinte:** Someone named Ulletical made a fantastic slaughter-house called, 'Aim\_Botz'. You can download it from, [**HERE**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660). This is very good for laying waste to endless hordes of bots (generally, you should go for headshots only) using a variety of weapons. As previously mentioned, Ulletical made this map, but he also makes a bunch of others. The most notable of which is his, ‘Recoil Master’ map - so you can practice beating the spray of each rifle. You can find all of Ulletical's maps, [**HERE**](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=330128769). Grab each of the Yprac maps; there is one for each competitive map. They all have their own individual pre-aim assault course, grenade lineup practice, etc. There’s also the Yprac, 'Aim Arena'; which is similar to the Ulletical Recoil\_Master map. You can find all of Yprac maps, [**HERE**](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=740795413). It's horses for courses, but you can’t go wrong with either map creator. # TRAINING CONFIG FILE: Download a training config and modify it to suit to your own needs - Here is mine: [https://pastebin.com/auz8L0UN](https://pastebin.com/auz8L0UN) Create a *Practice\_Config.cfg* file in your *...\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\\csgo\\cfg* folder and paste in that PasteBin data. Please have a look through the config and familiarize yourself with the commands and the overall syntax used. I'd highly recommend looking at the binding of keys. You can change your key binds until your heart is content, but I'd highly recommend, as a minimum, using individual binds for grenades and also a no-clip bind for ""practice mode"" (this also applies to the practice maps). When you start up your own CS Server (with bots), just go into Console and type: *exec practice\_config* The console will suggest an autocomplete, then just use the arrow buttons. Once you've hit Enter, the round will restart. # THE MOST SENSITIVE SUBJECT OF THEM ALL: This is a touchy subject here in the CSGO community: ***sensitivity***. It’s all personal preference, but I’d recommend you keep your eDPI (Effective Dots Per Inch) at 1200 or below. Anything above that and you’ll be able to move your crosshair erratically with only your wrist. eDPI is simply: Counts Per Inch \* In-Game Sensitivity. Obviously, eDPI depends on your setup. If you only have a small mouse mat then you’ll need a high mouse DPI for your desktop and the same in-game. I used to run 1600CPI on my mouse, but I also had a shorter (cheap) gaming pad. Now I have an MM300 Medium (360x300mm) and can get away with lower CPI &amp; in-game sensitivity settings. I currently use 800CPI (counts-per-inch) on my mouse and 1 sensitivity in-game - This equates to 800eDPI. I don’t think I can do a 180 spin from the centre of my mousemat, but if an enemy is behind you, you’re going to be more or less dead, regardless. If I was to ever become an AWPer I’d up my sensitivity to 800DPI + 1.5 sensitivity, in order to increase the speed of my “flick” with the scope. As previously mentioned, I used to run 1600CPI (on an old MX Master) and in-game I’d have 2.x sensitivity. After lowering my sensitivity (to 0.625) my aim improved dramatically. It can be very tempting to run circa-3000eDPI, because it feels seriously responsive, but I’d advise against it. Unless your mouse mat is the size of a coaster, of course. # STEAM SECURITY AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO CONSIDER: If you haven’t already done so: 1. Buy CSGO Prime - This will reduce your chances of encountering hackers and smurfs by a significant margin. 2. Add your mobile phone number to Steam - The benefit of this is two-fold. A) It increases the level of security and recovery offered for your Steam account and B) it doubles down by boosting your Trust Factor for Valve’s matchmaking system in CSGO. 3. Enable Steam Guard on your account; and download Steam onto your mobile phone. Remember: ***2FA in this day and age is important!*** 4. Go into console and type: cl\_autowepswitch 0 - This will save you from being murdered. You'll thank me later. # IN CONCLUSION: I honestly don’t think the skill ceiling in CS has ever been higher. Even those in Silver can be leagues above their own individual skill level; excluding the hordes of Smurfs and hackers. It’s gonna be a long, winding, **Road to Global**, for all of us.

Here's the key, learn the behaviour of players in matchmaking. Every rank has their thing, but obviously the higher the rank the harder it is to take advantage of it. Big example that regularly works about MG2 to LE, imagine a post plant 1v1 or 1v2 on A site Mirage. You are the T on site. If there is a CT in the Jungle or connector area, it is practically a guarantee they'll go stairs and you can just wait for them to pop their head up. In my experience and opinion that is the best way to get through matchmaking, become a one man army and play smart individually. That way you aren't going to be kept back as much by toxic or non-English speaking teammates. I know it often sucks, and it sucks to say this but honestly in my opinion that is your best bet, or you're gonna have to play with friends or play faceit.",0.031,0.793,0.176,0.9862,1

Back when i was learning my job, we had cs 1.6 on the work pcs. We were 4 people learning there, so whenever the boss went away, we would play a 2v2 on dust 2. Just one of us 4 was a pc gamer and the other 2 never played any fps game, while i played some shooters on ps3/4. So one friend was very good in the game and showed us some tricks and the other 2 were as bad as me, in pc gaming, but they also weren‘t as experienced in fps games as i am. So every in every game it was my pc gamer friend with one of the others, against me and the other one and it was so fun. In class we had 2 other friends which also played on pc and they always told me to get cs, so we can play together. At some point i got csgo and play a few games with the friend from work, but not any ranked games, just some demolition. Then later the 2 other friends wanted to play normal ranked games together, but i was still so bad. But well all 3 of my friends had to take smurf accounts to play with me and they don‘t really care for low ranks like gold. I played with them every now and then and we had fun, but basically i was just getting carried by my friends till gold. At first we played together frequently, but later when we finished our school, i didn‘t really had any contact with them anymore. So now i still got on my pc like once per month to play some demolition games in cs to have fun. But i never played ranked again since i would make my team lose and it wouldn‘t be fun. It‘s nice how mostly bad players play demolition, so it‘s fun, but sometimes there is one player who knows a bit about this game on one team and it‘s just a massacre And i remember a game on safehouse where an enemy was using wallhacks. It was so obvious for everyone who watched him and my team always wanted the other team to kick him, but they didn‘t. So at some point one of my teammates said fuck it and used his wallhacks too. The rest of the game was just those 2 players killing everyone thru the walls and then a 1v1 between 2 players with wallhacks. But basically demolition is good enough for bad players to have fun and if you really want to play competitive games, you should get 1-3 teammates who play too and be experienced in the game. So basically if you are new and aren‘t really experienced in the game, you could just play some demolition to have fun and get used to playing this game, befor you play ranked.",0.098,0.67,0.232,0.9982,2

From my experience jumps with proper strafes come from practice as your mouse and keyboard movement get more in sync. You don't need 9 strafes per jump but knowing how to strafe properly is really useful.There is usually accuracy% in the chat or hud, so pay attention to it as you add more strafes to your jumps.

If they're an abuseable mechanic by your team it removes a range of tactics, as for the mute I have all my teams perma muted while in silver, until about sem. And that what angers me the most, players have been reporting the same problem for years and valve still doesnt have a fix or solution for it. Same with the +left in console to not have to play the match to avoid being banned, its such an easy command and valve should have a system to detect when someone uses console commands to go afk. And when they removed jump scouting it took a large chunk of tactics out of the game, why bother using a scout now? The scope goes shakey when you walk and has a slightly higher recovery time. Another big problem is the $2k negev and the useless m249, every other round Im in theres 1 person that uses the negev exclusively. Now its part of the game and they're just winning their way, but atleast reincrease the price to like $4k, the negev is a 2nd round gun now. And its literally impossible to peak a corner when someone has a laser beam of bullets flying around it. Yes you can wait for the reload but most people prefire and peak the corner with the negev. I think my biggest frustration is that I used to love css, and csgo but dont really want to leave the game permanently but it seems that the game isnt going to be fixxed anytime soon and the player base is just getting more toxic by the day.

Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.

Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah.

What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations!

Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.

If a case had 50% chance of dropping a knife, are you sure you'll get a key every 2 crates. The answer is - _you can open any number of cases, but you'll never be guaranteed to get a knife._ The actual solution probably goes somewhat this way. Let's say I wanna open *n* cases. What's the probability none of them have a knife. As the probability of it not being a knife for each case is 99.74% or 0.9974 Let's think we want at least _one_ knife in the cases we open so the probability of that happening is 1-(0.9974^n) After running some numbers, I found out that, you have a 99.91% probability of getting at least one knife when you open _2700_ cases.

1620136448,2021-05-04,"forget the stats. The way out of silver is, step-by-step: \- learn to shoot without moving (aim bots or csgohub. Face a bot, very close to him. Strafe and kill a bot behind him without killing the one near you. The shot will only be accurate if you counterstrafe) \- muscular memory: Your aim is as precise as your sensitivity is low. This is probably very easy to grasp. Does that mean your e-DPI should be nikos (600dpi)? No. There is a in between ""i can shoot precisely"" and ""i can move without smashing my mouse into everything"". If you have a good mouse and a reasonable mousepad (or some space) consider lowering your DPI to something between 1000-1500 e-DPI (mouseDPI\*csgo console sensitivity number). Then you got to train in aimbots/csgohub to make ur muscles get used to your new sensitivity. 500 kills per day for 7 days should make it. \- Learn the angles and aim positioning: silver usually walk around the map with the aim too low. With time, you'll learn the right height of enemies head considering uneven terrain. The best way to learn this and where to put your aim is downloading community map ""yprac"" for any map you like the most and enter ""preaim/prefire training"" \- Surf: there is a community map called Surf Map - How2Surf / How to Surf by vizoomer. This will eventually help with mouse/keyboard coordination \-deathmatch: play one everyday. The thing is: this will improve your basics, but you got to train right. Every seasoned player will tell you that is very hard to break old habits, so you got to train from the beggining the right way. What is the right way? SHOOT HEADS. Focus on HS only. Not only one tapping, or bursting. Spraying as well. The objetive is, kill as many as you can, don't aim for the body. If you aim for the body, you're doing it wrong. Don't play other modes, like guns race, because using multiple weapons will make your aim never get used to the thing you should be doing. Last thing: don't focus on grenades now. When you get to gold 1-2, these will be necessary, but first you need to learn the basics. Grenades will be one of the greatest assets in your arsenal, but only if used right. The thing with grenades is: you gotta watch youtube videos. And this is not for everyone. Plus, youtube videos will show you 20 grenades, but you won't memorise any if you don't practice. So, go to youtube, learn how to make a .cfg file for offline grenade throwing, practice ONE smoke and ONE flash until you understood it perfectly, use it in game. Once you can use it consistently, train another smoke, another flash, use it in game. &amp;#x200B; If you need, i can give you a practice routine and community maps links.",0.079,0.846,0.075,0.0965,2

Once you get some mastery of basics you can start to have fun and dish out punishment - and this does not require quitting your job, just a half an hour a day of consistent training. You gotta put in some time. That being said, the game is positively fuck ridden with cheaters right now. It is far more atrocious than any of time period of this entire franchise. I downloaded walls (on a Smurf) for the fun of it. I'd say about 95% of games I had people looking at me through large chunks of the map. Ranked high silvers with upwards of 300 hours no less, sometimes 5 stacks of them constantly staring at me though walls. With trust factor on. Some other red flags without your own walls: They fucking suck until they get an awp - they only one tap - they don't know how to spray - one or two players play like they always know where you are - they wide swing around every fucking corner like an animal and somehow manage to still prefire you without lineups Once you do actually have 2000 hours in the game, cheating becomes extremely fucking apparent, even subtle shit In lieu of this you have three choices: Either play long enough until your trust factor is so high that you only get a cheater 1 out of 10 games, or just a few closet cheaters that will still let you win. Id say this mark is around 1000 hours of trust factor competitive Or Wait for the port to source 2. I am sure valve is going to clean up their shit with the port, because I am sure they're going to sell licenses for some rediculous price. (Even though most fans bought the game when it was still $20) The reboot will bring them so much money in fact that I'm sure the anticheat will be close to perfect - instead of the ""wave"" banning bullshit that is currently happening Or Try faceit. They actually give a singular dick about if people are cheating or not, so you can play in a competitive setting where you're not getting demolished by 3 years olds that only know how to use the w key and preline up headshots through walls and click when you move over their crosshairs - people actually take the game semi seriously here, so you will have to do that training I mentioned earlier As of now, valve will continue to solely release community made skins and community made maps and put a giant red stamp on it that says ""here's your content that we put so much work into"" There is a secret 4th option: Uninstall",0.085,0.803,0.112,0.8692,4

I usually spend a few hours finding the lineup and perfecting it with a main goal of making them as easy as possible(with varying degrees of succes). When I've found a nade and lineup I like, I then boot up CS through **[Half Life Advanced Effects(HLAE)](https://www.advancedfx.org/download/)** which enables me to do a lot of fun stuff like changing skins through **[nSkinz](https://github.com/namazso/nSkinz)** and using **[Reshade](https://reshade.me/)** which I currently only use for the greenscreen/chromakey effect. I use **[OBS](https://obsproject.com/)** to record and the key overlay is **[NohBoard](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/nohboard.44/)** with a badly made custom preset. I use Adobe Premiere to ""build"" the main structure of the video and adding music, sound effects and finally color grading. All effects, zooms, 3D tracking etc. are done in After Effects. **The Intro** In this video it's just me noclipping(*I'm working on ~~using~~ understanding campaths for the next video*) to my character which is setup to not show the viewmodel so I can add that in later. I've then used speedramping in After Effects to get the slowmo/speed up feel. **The Lineup** The lineup roughly consists of 5 layers: **1.** Main recording of the lineup and throw without the viewmodel. **2.** Recording of only the viewmodel using Reshade's greenscreen/chromakey effect. **3.** The main recording without the viewmodel but with a really low FOV to get a cleaner zoom(*in my previous videos I used to just zoom in on the first recording, but while being way easier and faster, it was too blurry*). **4.** Key overlay(NohBoard). **5.** 3d tracking the text and lines to walls on both the main*(even though you only see it for like half a second)* and zoom recording. **The Throw** The throw is me noclipping(*again campaths coming soon*(*hopefully*)) in slowmotion(*""host_timescale 0.1""*) then add shake, blur and all kinds of stuff in After Effects. **The Outro** From the part where the smoke hits the roof I've used ""*spec_pos*"" to get a start and end position and then using ""*spec_lerpto*"" to fly between them. I usually make a bind that should look something like this: ""*spec_goto* **[first position]**; *spec_lerpto* **[second position]** *8 8*(time in seconds)"" The last part is hard to explain, but a lot of 3d tracking, masking, layering and trial and error. _ I hope I answered your question &lt;3",0.034,0.862,0.103,0.9833,2

Turn a corner expecting someone to be there holding the angle. There's a good workshop map series by Yprac. Train on the preaim mode.

It's just not possible to be always good. 1. Don't assume your mental state is your only problem. Always try to improve further, like basic techniques, counter strafing and so on. 2. On the other hand, you should try to keep yourself and your team motivated. Send some good vibes, tell yourself and your team how good you are. Sometimes it really helps to say to yourself ""I'm the best on the server"" but don't think you're the very best. You can be better than someone else and have weaknesses nevertheless. I'm really sure you can improve a lot besides the mental weakness. 3. Like WarOwl would say: Give yourself the permission to failure! With this attitude you can work on your consitency. Try to identify your behavior and categorize your games into A, B (the Average), C. Then try to identify your current state in the game and adapt to it. When you play a round on dust2 and you realize that you play your A game, then go risky, make moves, bring the team forward. When you have a C game, play safe, give team info, throw some util, don't go for risky 1v1. Trust me, we all have those silver days but the key is to adapt. Dont try to prove yourself that you can hit a specific shot or definitly are able to win a fight because you did it in the past - this wouldn't work in a C game. Conclusion: You can always improve, even in solo q. But teamwork is maybe the most important skill in csgo. Maybe you will be more tilt resistent when you play with friends, because you can't hate some randoms. When you say that Solo q is no fun anymore, you should definitly play with others.

Just because it is a widespread phenomenon that is widely accepted by high rank players does not make it morally okay. It ruins the game for new players like OP, who undoubtedly experienced smurfs to not have ranked up in such a long time. Smurfing so you can play with friends is also not okay, just play unranked. There is exactly zero reasons to have an alt account for CSGO. A matchmaking system is designed to pit you against opponents of similar skill levels, when that doesn't happen because of a smurf, no one wins I've heard before that the team that gets dumpstered should try to learn from smurfs and try to better their own game based on the play style of the smurf. This is horseshit. Smurfs typically make plays where they fully rely on superior mechanical skill to bail them out of conventionally bad positioning, (i.e. running down mid alone without supportive flashes as a CT, something they would never do in their own rank) typically the only thing to learn from smurfs is ""have better aim"" which has no value. The team that loses learns little, gets demoralised and wastes half an hour of time they should be spending having fun and learning to get better The team that wins gets unearned elo, boosted to ranks they don't deserve, and ruin subsequent games for people in higher ranks. The smurf ruins 9 player's games, learns nothing, arguably gets worse as a player, and is incentivised to continue smurfing by the success they have and the subsequent rush of dopamine their monkey brain has been starved of in their own rank. Say it with me now, Smurfing is cheating.",0.093,0.721,0.186,0.983,6

If hackers are making up for 60-70% of players in cs, banning would mean loss of revenue. Hackers currently still spend thousands of dollars on cases, keys &amp; etc. And, to lose out on that, means they'll lose out quite dearly. This also means a hard ban on players like an IP ban would cut the player base by 60-70%. This would mean hackers would find a way to bypass IP, and create a new primed account and obtain new hacks without spending on cases/keys = loss of opportunity revenue. Hence why you do see VAC bans on hacking accounts that have little to no inventory. But, its rare nowadays (keyword) to see them ban hacking accounts that have spent money on cases and keys. Also note, imagine telling your competition (like valorant) that player base has dropped 70%.. it doesn't look good in general. Again, it might get some users back, but until hackers just keep bypassing and hacking, the the same thing just reoccurs (people leave and hacking usage continously increases). Personally I don't think CSGO cares if the games becomes 100% HvH as long as it brings in them money. You can argue 'but a lot of people stream tournaments', which is absolutely true, but lets not forget, people that don't play cs anymore due to the hacking issues. and instead play other games still watch tournaments in general.",0.105,0.811,0.083,-0.2964,3

The reason is the poor conditions for professional female players.*** ***- Now there is no future for women in Counter strike, says Effie Karabuda, game reporter at Swedish Radio.*** One week ago, Julia ""juliano"" Kiran announced that she was leaving the game Counter strike. In the same vein, colleague Zainab ""zAAz"" gave Turkey the same message. \- The CS scene is dead, especially for girls. As a professional player, there is nothing to pick up there anymore. I am against dividing women and men, but we must become better at supporting and highlighting women, says Julia Kiran in a video on the streaming service Twitch **""Hard jargon""** The two Swedish e-sports players are not alone in leaving the game. Female players around the world have already done the same. \- It's a pretty tough climate for girls. If you look at Counter strike as a game, it's hard jargon. As soon as you enter the game, it is an insult and people point out that you are a woman, says Effie Karabuda, game reporter at Swedish Radio. In addition to Julia Kiran and Zainab Turkie, relatively few women succeed in having a professional career in Counter strike \- There are not many sponsors or big tournaments for women so it is difficult to have a professional career and make money from it, says Effie Karabuda. **""A great statement""** Julia Kiran stopped, she posted a live video where she explained that she will now switch to the game Valorant, as many other women who leave Counter strike do. \- Julia Kiran and Sida Turkey are among the world's best e-sports players. So that they switch to Valorant is a big statement. I think it is Valorant that applies to female e-sports in the future, says Effie Karabuda.

There must also be noted that this review was written over the time I was dead in CS, and may not seem to be coherent because it was broken up into segments that i spendt writhing for 1-2 minutes at a time, I was pretty much mashing away at my keyboard because of frustration from the expectation of a player who could atleast manage to arrange the words in the correct order, and without 1-3 additional letters every 2-3 words. My mistake in this was that i expected someone who knew english. I still stand by my review, as to the reason that a reader should be capable of reading the date stamped to a comment and asser wether or not to see it as relevant as for the time of reading it.

Faceit might be an option if you might want to take the competitive CS a bit more competitive later on. Nothing you want to dwell into with no practice and experience. Faceit is nothing you need to ponder over until you might feel that the experience through normal matchmaking is not enough for you. Other replies are good. Go to workshop on steam and get the aimbotz, yprac maps and such. There you can practice your mechanical skills with aim and spray control and map knowledge. Play casual and deathmatch to get more used to real players without having to worry about the competitive stuff. And otherwise dont worry too much about playing competitive match making, you will get better in time, enjoy the competitive match making. You are not gonna wreck players instantly but learn from the experience. Practice is something you will have to do. You will get better and you will gain experience. Some things you might learn quick, some things might take a bit of time. There might be tutorials on youtube as well.

My first 10 matches were quite challenging but I was ranked SEM and it didnt take long until I reached GN1 and from there it was a slow and steady climb. I always made sure I did my warmup before each game and tried my best to outplay my opponents and always being unpredictable. I tried very hard not to tilt even if we lost and gave my team as much information as I could to increase the chances of winning. I didn't win every game but I have a solid winrate above 50% and in almost all games (except when I was on the final 3 ranks LE, LEM, SMFC) i was the top fragger or at least at the top 3 of the scoreboard. As usual I got accused of cheating a lot and tbh if I played against myself I would call myself a cheater aswell lmao. The key thing I am missing is that I am extremely inconsistent sometimes and it makes me look like I toggled in the eyes of my opponents, but I guess being inconsistent is part of the csgo experience lol. What I would like to recommend anyone who would like to get better at CS is to watch a ton of pro matches and I can't stress this enough: aim warmup as often as you can. If I didnt use ulleticals Aim_Botz custom map to practice my aim I wouldn't have been this good tbh. I often see people just launching cs and instantly going for a comp match without warmup.

For example, a cross-dominant person might write with the right hand and do everything else with the left one, or manage and kick a ball preferentially with the left leg.

Please note, deleting your config.cfg file will remove all customizations you have made to CS:GO, including mouse sensitivity, keybinds, crosshairs, HUD modifications, and other in-game settings. For this reason we recommend moving your config file temporarily to test the issue. On Windows the file can be found here: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\userdata\\&lt;YOURID&gt;\\730\\local\\cfg On a Mac the file can be found here: \~Users/Library/Application Support/Steam/userdata/&lt;YOURID&gt;/730/remote/cfg/ If this solves your issue you will know the problem lies somewhere in your config file. Unfortunately, due to the number of unique settings in config files we are not able to provide in-depth support for issues caused by them. If the issue is not resolved you may need to verify your game files or check any recent changes you have made to your CS:GO install.

1640323332,2021-12-24,Sounds like the second one is a steam API key scam the way it works is you sign into a shady site and it sets your steam API key to their key which can control your trades (cancel and start them but not accept them) since this key can track your trades when you send trade offer it essentially clones the account you’re sending to name avatar etc then it cancels the real trade and sends the one to the cloned account and when you go to confirm the trade you are Most likely not going to notice the fact that you won’t be friends with the user and BOOM skins are gone. you can check to make sure your steam API key isn’t compromised [here](https://steamcommunity.com/login/home/?goto=%2Fdev%2Fapikey) if you have one make sure to hit revoke unless you’re sure it’s the API key YOU have set if you’re unsure just revoke it You can also check YouTube for a video that probably explains it a little better than me,0.055,0.846,0.1,0.8475,2

1640444851,2021-12-25,"basically supply and demand. If you want a shiny knife or a cool skin for your favorite weapon, you have to either be lucky to unbox it from a container, or buy it from the marketplace. Since you have to at least spend 2$ per case just for the key to open it, each skin has at least some value to begin with. Blue skins (the skins with the blue background which indicates the rarity of the skin) are the most common ones, followed by purple, pink, red and gold. Gold is the rarest type which are either gloves or knifes, depending on which container you open. These have a rarity of ~0.26% which is very rare. You're more likely to get a blue skin which have a rarity of around 70%. edit: its actually 80% This alone makes these skins very rare and expensive to get from opening containers. Which means the supply cant meet demand. Thid drives up the cost of these rare skins which explains why certain knifes and skins are worth thousands of dollars. And because these skins are tradable and csgo is one of the most popular games, they hold their value. Often times even increasing in value as time goes on. The most expensive skin i believe was traded for $150,000 which was an AK-47 Case hardened with a rare pattern, minimal wear stat track edition with 4 very rare and expensive stickers. Here is a [link](https://blog.lootbear.com/most-expensive-csgo-skin/) if you want to see for yourself. There is also a mechanic called 'trade-ups' in csgo. This allows you to basically merge 10 skins of a rarity (e.g. Blue) into 1 higher tier skin (in this example purple). This automatically makes lower tier skins a little more worth since players can basically buy these lower tier skins and trade them up for higher tier skins, essentially deleting 10 skins from existence and slowly declining the supply of these lower tier skins, which in turn drives up their cost. Csgo skins is a very complicated thing and I think it's quite interesting, even though I have no interest in buying these expensive skins",0.044,0.866,0.09,0.9421,4

1640489092,2021-12-26,"Disclaimer; I’m not a pro, and I might not be 100% right..... but! The way I understand the mechanics, is that you want to stop as fast as absolutely possible. So by keep holding down your D key, you are negating the effectiveness of the counter strafe. What I would do is I let go of D, tap A, and then hold both A and D. Reason being if I keep the D key depressed, while simultaneously pressing A, I’m telling the game to accelerate me both left and right at the same time, effectively cancelling each other out, and thus being equivalent of not pressing either buttons. What I do instead is, when m I let go of D, I stop giving the game a “move right” command, and only gives it a “move left” command. This means I give the game a command to counteract my movements to the right, and I stop sooner, meaning I will be accurate faster. If you want to hold both keys depressed, that is an option, you just need to let go of D until you have stopped moving completely, and only then can you hold both keys down, to keep you still.",0.11,0.842,0.049,-0.923,2

They don't fix anything... they don't care 'bout the feedback from the community. Funniest part is: You get like 100 cases, kay? Let's say you spend 1€ per case (bought them from the market) which means that valve got 15% from your 1€ already = 0.15€\*100... which is 15€.. you buy 100 keys which are another 250€. 265€ for valve and you got nothing out of it so far.

Nah... you don't... if you sell all items on the market... valve takes another 15% from the sold skins... so 15% of 400€ are 60€. Valve got 325€ and you have 10€ minus... yikes... fuck valve.

I live in Sweden, so I play que with players from Sweden, Finland, Russia, Poland, Turkey, Germany and so on. 50% of players are from Russia. Have not had any big issues as long I dont tilt and flame. 2. This is 4th for 5th time I get to Global, I created another account to play with some irl friends and ""accidently"" won alot and ranked Global on that account aswell. First time I reached Global was after about 500h back in 2016. A combination of many years of competetive Call of Duty and Battlefield made my learning curve shorter and easier to get to Global back then 3. Started at rank AK and Double AK 4. Learned that your impact in the game ""HLTV rating"" is far more important than winning the actual game. MM does not work like Faceit. 5. My best tip on SoloQ would first of all, keep your emotions in check. If you are at a bad mood, dont play competitive. Play a more casual game, go outside or anything that makes you better. 6. The biggest difference betweek ranks in MM and Faceit is not just raw aim, it´s the more tactical part. Every opponent play differently, some very aggressive and some very passive. Dont just play ""by the book"", I play really aggressive and often getting called for being braindead by the enemy team. But dont ever overextend. 7. **(This is joke, but have a bit of truth in it)** Get a russian girlfriend, been with mine for almost 7 years. You learn how to handle them xD 8. No 5 man stack, you will play against other 5 man stacks. Even if I played against full level 10s with 2500-3000 elo on mm, it´s pretty rare. 9. Kill 100-200 bots before a game.

Counterstrafing is when you are moving to a direction (Either left or right) you tap the opposite key to instantly stop... Allowing you to be precise faster. Why do you need to do this? Because in csgo, rifles (All weapons really but mainly rifles) can't be shot accurately when moving. And even if you let go of the keys there's a ""De-acceleration"" period. And by counter strafing you eliminate that time. Configuration: Also, before anything else I'd recommend getting the ""Correct"" / recommended settings first: - Getting a sensitivity which isn't too high too low - You could try 4:3 if you want, is not mandatory - Binding your nades to individual keys is very good and should be done as soon as possible because there is a transition period Economy: Undertanding the economy of the game is essential.

1641319041,2022-01-04,"First, I totally agree with Maher on his first line. The reason I'd argue movement over aim (first that is), is because movement actually helps with your aim, indirectly. And the reason for that is that having good movement sort of conditions you to aim at head level at all times, or close to it. When you're doing that, you're more likely to get headshots or at least position your shots in the right place and usually spray thereafter. After that , you can work on your aim. One key difference though is, if it's not obvious, work on them at the same time, but just place a slightly higher emphasis on movement over aim, for the time being. So instead of surfing (for now), you could do DM or AIM botz/CSGoHub, but spread them out a bit so u get some work on your movement (and aim) as well. If the bots are too close, then you're not moving around as much, and thus working more on your aim. So good movement, should generally look as much as a straight line, but like with most game skills, it takes practice. Competitive CS:GO is not a place where you can just run around and shoot people, but instead, what's great about it, is that, (for me at least), you have to ""earn your kills."" Some ways of doing that instead of just running around and shooting players is learning the importance of walking in the game (so your enemy doesn't hear you), using utility to clear out tough angles/spots, and just kind of moving around the map to gather information about the enemy and predict where they might be. So the kills imo, are harder to get, but also more rewarding. There's a psychological component as well to the game, based on you and your opponent's behavior and how they interact with one another. I've also written an [article](https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/how-to-rank-up-fast-in-csgo) (Gamersdecide) on ranking up/tips for CS:GO based on this factor, but no worries if you decide not to read it. So a few examples could be something as simple as your opponent going to the same site (putting aside the frustration) because it's working or mabye going B once in awhile to throw you off, but predominantly focusing on the A site . Or someone playing more aggressive to gain the early man advantage or balance it back out; therefore you might be more likely to expect a push or early lurk. Of course, it's important to keep track of this information and see whether it's consistent or not, otherwise you might have to change strategies. Just a few examples. &amp;#x200B; Other things to take into consideration, generally speaking (and I wont go into too much detail) is 1) game roles (not just before, but during a game, depending on the situation), such as entry fragger/lurker and whether it's appropriate or not to do so at this time/round, or changing roles in game (such as picking up an AWP or a teammate who's struggling as an entry fragger) 2) positoning, as in varying where u hide or lurk, but if you change every round, that's ironically also predictable, so it's okay to stay in the same spots, once in awhile, esp if its working, 3) learning to spray, since getting headshots all the time isn't practical, 4) util usage, since dry peeking every corner will pretty much leave your player dead, and 5) game sense, which although isn't a tangible factor, like aim, can help you get more frags and position yourself better overall, ex. for a retake or choosing the correct site if they plan to plant near the end of the round, for example. Game sense would kind of be like analyzing your opponent's behavior based on not just the previous round, but a cumulation of rounds. Sometimes though, it's not rocket science, players are just finding openings and taking advantage of them or taking sites because certain opposing players, cant hold them for example. Sorry for the long reply. Goodluck.",0.066,0.828,0.106,0.9816,1

1641569606,2022-01-07,"You wouldn't want me to do that.... First, Your a troll on Reddit with a literal ""throwaway"" for an account. One of millions of others out there , all a walking joke of a meme on the internet, hiding behind a keyboard. Wow. I'd imagine if you do this in your spare time, you're probably a cheater as well. I digress to your level of logic first, though second now I'll explain more thoroughly what's coming for the likes of you and your trolling game cheating mates. Detection is a bit more complex then I've described. I simplified my description for your under the bridge mind to wrap itself around, to be honest. The only difficult thing about anti cheat is catching the sophisticated programs that change their signature with each injection of artificial code. This is however also a cop out. Its very easy to detect. The game operates in a specific fashion. Specific mechanics. 99.9% of hacks inject code that falls out of these specific mechanics. The hard part of detection is in microadjustments from a player in an FPS Game. Sophisticated hacks mask their code injections by using relative crosshair placement and microadjustments, as if it were organic motion from the user. Simple hacks are entirely blatant, like spinbots, aimbots, or info assistance like wall hacks. Game mechanics compared to blatant hack behavior are immediately detected. Why they aren't immediately banned is a different subject entirely. For sophisticated hacks,The difference between a hacks input and an organic users input is that the hack always leaves a pattern. While 99.99% of normal users input is random at best. Only appearing calculated with a very good users playing style. While hacks attempt to mimic a user with a good playing style. However always leaving a pattern in how it aim assists or provides more info to the user of the hack program. A simple algorithm comprised of normal - advanced game mechanics, would easily detect outliers. The outliers being really good players, blatant hackers, and hackers with sophisticated programs. Yet while complimenting the algorithm by pairing it with network packet monitoring, the detection monitoring would pick out hackers like a single pin in an amazon warehouse of hay bales. Within 1-2 rounds (3 minutes on average) of game play, while monitoring user input mechanics, the outlier - or SUSpect, would be detected. Then immediately confirmed by either blatant artificial input in network packets, or immediately confirmed by signature changes in user network packets. Both are a confirmed blatant use, or confirmed signature change from the user's side of the network. Though this isn't anything new. This is how all successful hack detection software operates. VAC - or more specifically, VACnet, is actually already developing this process for Steam and CSGO. Somewhat quietly though, because they - Valve - only really started doing so around the end of last year. It should have been done years ago and already implemented, by the example of just about every other gaming platform, professional or private leagues, having already done so years ago as well. They already use a system as I have described. They immediately ban the users as well, without prejudice. The current work around is hitting hackers with red trust factors, until it is completed for deployment on all Steam servers. As Overwatch can be smurfed, hackers using farm accounts or using multiple accounts purchased or otherwise, along with VAC bypass software, the servers are currently still the wild west for hackers. There have been Pros, community advocates, regular players, even Valve developers, all speaking out publicly that CS has been a cesspool of hackers for too long. A safe haven, even. We all just need to apply some more pressure to speed things along and deploy the system to Steam servers that already works with what is essentially 100% efficiency. Can't wait to see it happen to be honest. All the likes of you will be gone. For CSGO; Your farm accounts, your trolling of normal players, your greifing in matchmaking, etc. There should be a noticeable drop in prices on the CSGO economy, once the system is deployed as well. No more farm accounts to spoof prices! Oh and a nice little side note, most of the current hack softwares out there have been a wonderful data comparison to build the new detection system. Why shut them down when you can infiltrate them all internally, learn from them, and eradicate them all with one deployment? After all, there's really only a handful of ways to mimic the same code that game mechanics operate on :-). Detection bypassing software is also included. They already get dropped from the network after a short time period now, from being unable to provide login certificates. A small number of bypassers re-spoof their network connection to continue playing and not get dropped. Both of these loopholes will be closed. This new system will also cover all games on the Steam platform. Not just CS. I do personally appreciate Valve working on this quietly, as they have done so with good reason. Though I would like hackers gone today, like anyone... It will however be well worth the wait to see them all disappear, essentially wiped out by their own hand. Their own work at building hacks being the same process that is going to eliminate them. Having literally taught detection software how to find them with extreme efficiency.

1643819493,2022-02-02,"Solo queues are the worst IMO, when I first started playing I went blind into csgo comp and really screwed my rank. I would get in a lobby with 4 people who were queued together and i would get kicked everytime. Can't make it out of silver now even though I'm almost always top frag. Playing with friends makes the game 100x better. Even if you lose. The first thing you're going to want to adjust is your mini map. You should be able to set sizes from the settings menu or you can go through console developer options. ( console developer options is better IMO, but it will take some figuring out. Great YT videos and tutorials on it. ) For example I play 90% nuke competitive. If you're setting back ramp when the bomb is planted the sound may throw you off as to if it's A or B. Being able to read the mini map and seeing teammates locations will tell you where the bomb is before ever having to ask A or B. You will also want keybinds for all grenades IMO. Disable that scroll wheel ASAP, I don't mind playing with new players at all. But way to often I see them bite a bullet because they're cycling through grenades. I have a specific key for everything in the game and some items are doubled to my mouse. Easy access. I saw someone mention the recoil maps to you. I'm posting this from mobile so hopefully these are the right links if someone else hasn't sent them. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=419404847 Recoil map ^ https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660 Aim botz training map ^ These are the 2 most popular maps. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2332379928 This is an awp only map, pretty fun with friends^ retro style map. There are tons of things in csgo you can add or change via the console options. You can change the character FOV and even how far your character bobs up, down, left, right when you move. I have mine completely disabled so mine is a still character even when I run. Then you can break csgo down even further into what resolution you play. There are advantages and disadvantages to both sides. This is a huge debate in the csgo community. I personally play on a 1920x1080 monitor on a 4:3 resolution stretch. So I'm actually running 1440×1080. This will stretch your game across the X axis of the screen making your character and other characters a little wider. Easier to shoot. But because you're stretching your resolution you lose some of your vision radius. Both your left and right side will actually see less of the game. I wouldn't advise messing with resolution or FOV in a competitive lobby as it will screw up your eDPI following the changes. I would play a DM or casual game to mess with those. Either way if you have questions or anything I can try to help you. If you add me just let me know your username because I have a pile of random friend requests. https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198320261912/ I'm 21 and play mostly with other guys my age, we drink and have a good time.

The Razer mice are technically among the fastest, but even the Viper Mini isn't all that ""mini"", so if you need a smaller mouse (like me with my, apparently, infant hands) you'll have to look elsewhere. I'm currently on the go, i.e. not at my usual desk, so I got myself a SteelSeries Rival 3 which is also technically among the zooming fast mice, and I can hit a few things with it, but for my hands it's just a little bit too bulky. My main gaming mouse is a Glorious Model O- which is ultra-light and very low, perfect for my hands, but it's technically not among the lowest-latency mice. I do hit more/better with it than with the SteelSeries, though. But if your hands or your gripping method allow it, then purely because of the technical advantages, I would recommend a Razer Viper 10/10 times. Just hope you never need their support, I had the worst experience in ANY support case with them recently. After a certain point, I felt like they were being dicks on purpose, just for the fun of it, sending me one-by-one ""please provide this number"", ""please provide that number"" requests, only to bully me around and test how far they can go before I'd start swearing and calling them names.

1651743392,2022-05-05,"""Skill"" in CSGO is often talkes about along 3 different dimensions and I thought I'd give you some beginner tips for each. i tried to include key words so you know what to google for if you want more info. 1) aim/mechanics Did you know? If you hold a rifle/sniper and you run while shooting, you have terrible accuracy? This is called movement inaccuracy and while it applies to pistols and SMGs as well, rifles/snipers are borderline unusable while running. So what you want to do is when you run around a corner, you want to run around the corner sideways using the ""A"" (or ""D"") button and then once you are in the open very lightly tap the opposite direction key ""D"" (or ""A"" alternatively) to make your character stop faster in order to shoot accurately faster. This takes some practice but is a key skill called ""counter strafing"". &amp;#x200B; 2) game sense Always try to aim where you expect an opponent (or more precisely an opponents head) to be. These are the easiest kills to get basically but the require you to have an understanding where enemys can be at any given point in the round. Think of the enemys position as a ""cloud of likelyhood"". If you get surprised and have to wildly swing your crosshair around this is called a ""flick"" and while it is a mark of high skill to consistently hit your flick shots as a beginner you should focus on reducing the amount of times where you have to flick around. Don't practice flicks yet, learn how to avoid having to flick. :) Try to never stand in the open without cover. 3) Communication / Team work Team work makes the dream work. Your teammates can help you win fights easily and are your most precious resource. When a teammate is fighting the enemy consider this as him taking aggro from the enemy so you might just have the opportunity to swing out of cover and take fights without being shot at. Cover your teammates and have your teammates cover you. If you die try to communicate what you saw of the enemy. How many? Were they close already? Did you see the bomb? This is key information to help your team make the correct ""macro decisions"" of where to rotate the players. Easiest example: You died close to bombsite B and saw 4 enemys + the bomb? Your teammates from A should start rotating B.",0.101,0.777,0.122,0.8422,4

1653160971,2022-05-21,"You should take the time to learn and get comfortable with the keyboard and mouse. I was in the same position with you, I moved from console to pc and my first game was CSGO. It will take a little bit of time to get comfortable but less than you think imo. There are many reasons not to use a controller, your aim will be a lot less clean and its just generally more sluggish for all aspects of aiming and moving around with a controller. Also keyboard is key for cs. Some places you need to jump up to in maps require you to jump and crouch to get a slight height boost, I'm pretty sure its not even possible to do this on a controller. Likewise using your keyboard will allow you to set up binds for certain things which you couldn't do on a controller. I can't think of a single benefit to using a controller it is definitely a disadvantage at best and at worst a total hindrance as you may not even be able to do certain things like the crouch jumps etc. I have over 3k hours in cs and played at a highish level (level 8 games on faceit and was a level 6 myself) whilst this isn't amazing I feel like I can try give you some tips! Aim train! - download workshop maps like recoil masters to practice your spray control and aim botz to practice your tap firing, when you begin to feel more comfortable go in DM servers, valve DM servers are fine, there are community servers too and faceit has their own DM servers which is what I personally use. You should work on your aim placement, learn where your aim should be as you walk around the map so its always head high so if an enemy appears you can just tap and hit head. As you become more advanced with your aim you'll be able to bring in things like counter-strafing too, but as a total beginner I'd focus on the aim placement, tap firing and learning recoil. Set up your key binds - I played for nearly a decade and over 3k hours before I set up proper keybinds. I recently did and it has completely changed my game for the better. For example I have pulling out my smoke ""4"", Molotov ""5"" flash ""Mouse 4"" and HE ""Alt"" this gave me much easier access to my nades rather than scroll wheel or spamming 4. its quicker, much more effective and only took me around 8-10 hours of play to perfect the muscle memory. Use scroll wheel to jump - this isn't necessary a lot of people don't but ever since changing my scroll wheel to jump it makes movement mechanics so much easier. You can bunny hop and strafe so much more cleanly (as a total beginner you don't need to worry about these things too much but it can't hurt!) limit tilt and don't be toxic - Too much of the community are toxic, don't become that. It's the worst thing. if someone is having a bad game they will never improve their performance by someone shit talking them. Try be positive. And if someone is toxic to you just mute them, trust me you'll play better for it. And don't be toxic in most pro games one or two players on the server are likely quite a bit negative but they still impact the game your K/D isn't the most important thing, your impact is. Have fun and play - The main thing is just to have fun, if its not fun there's not point playing so just enjoy what is imo the greatest game of all time! And the more you play the better your game sense will become therefore helping you to improve as a player! Edit: can't believe I forgot to mention this lol.Learn nade lineups - I think as a total beginner this is definitely not as important as becoming comfortable with keyboard and mouse and moving around the map. And I don't think its, as a total beginner, as important as learning to be confident with your aim. But nade lineups are one of the most important aspects of the game, there are many workshop maps to teach nade lineups for both 64 tick (Valve servers) and 128 tick (Faceit servers) also youtube videos and everything, Take some time to learn the smoke lineups and some nice pop flashes and you'll elevate your game and win chances by a lot!",0.083,0.725,0.192,0.9985,2

1653946620,2022-05-30,"You aren't thinking about the dynamics of the ""conflicts"" correctly. Russia in today's world wasn't in any way actively hostile with NATO or the US prior to 2014. Russia was working with NATO/EU countries to build pipelines, it was overall a good relationship. During the cold war the US was hostile with both Cuba and Russia already. So it's a completely different context for the actions that took place. The idea that we need to be close to Russia to have missiles ""in range"" of them is also ridiculous. The US can launch missiles from anywhere in the world and hit any target they want, we don't need proximity to a target and haven't since the 70s. Also the US doesn't expand NATO, nations can ask to join and then the existing members vote on it, and everyone has to agree in order for them to be added to NATO, this is actually coming up as a potential issue with Norway/Finland, because Turkey is threatening to veto their membership application. So no the US isn't just expanding it, countries are applying for membership and then the other countries in it consider the ramifications. Germany and France have repeatedly re-assured Russia that they would not allow Ukraine into NATO prior to their invasion because Russia indicated they wouldn't like that and they wanted to maintain their working relationship with Russia. It literally makes 0 sense for Germany and France to lie about this when they are going out of their way to work with Russia and build energy infrastructure with them. NATO also didn't invade anyone, they intervened in a genocide that was destabilizing the region and sending mass amounts of refugees into nato countries that they couldn't deal with effectively. There is also a long standing history of conflicts in the Balkans getting out of hand and drawing in more countries to fight so this was effectively in line with their overall mission of preventing large scale war in Europe. So they bombed strategic targets, no boots on the ground. You could argue that NATO was specifically made to combat the USSR, but that isn't entirely honest, it's primary purpose was preventing another war in Europe and the most likely aggressor at the time would have been the USSR, it really only shifted to entirely being anti-USSR after they rejected Molotov's proposal to join NATO in 1954 and the following year the USSR created the Warsaw pact. But NATO wasn't specifically made to counter just the USSR, it was to stop any aggressor from picking off euro countries 1 by 1 like Germany had started to do prior to ww2. Also your logic is flawed, how can the west simultaneously want Ukraine to join NATO (thus mandating that we protect them) but also want to sacrifice Ukraine to destroy Russia economically because it would be easier than an assassination (assuming we even wanted to do that)? Those two things are contradictory. I think the more likely situation is that Putin is irrationally paranoid and making really bad decisions leading to massive losses for Russia. It literally doesn't make any sense to fuck up all of the progress that has been made after the fall of the USSR based on speculation that maybe Ukraine will join NATO, which isn't something that would just happen overnight, and he could have effectively protested by shutting off gas to Germany if they refused to veto the application. The decision to invade makes no sense if the issues being fought over was Ukraine's status with NATO, Russia has plenty of more effective mechanisms to prevent that than an invasion. If NATO was the primary concern/reason to launch the invasion then Putin is truly a moron. But I don't think he's a moron I think he has ulterior motives and NATO is just a convenient excuse to give out to feign legitimacy for his actions but realistically it's just a land/resource grab after his puppet government got ousted. Even if everything you said is true Russia could have done way more things to stop Ukraine from joining NATO or pressuring for NATO to be dissolved in general that didn't involve invading Ukraine.

For binds like the jumpthrow, more than one command is required to execute it and an autoexec file will help you. To create such a file, you may want to follow these instructions. Step 1 Open Steam and find CS:GO in your Library. Right click the game or left click the gear icon. Look for an option called ""Manage"". Step 2 Hover your cursor over it and another set of options will appear. Left click ""Browse local files"". Step 3 This should open File Explorer on your computer. You will see a lot of files and folders, as well as the csgo.exe application. Double left click the folder named ""csgo"". Step 4 Now more files and folders will appear. Double left click the folder named ""cfg"". Step 5 Even more files and folders. Scroll down and look for any file that ends in "".cfg"" and then copy it. An example would be ""controller.cfg"". Step 6 Paste the copied file in your current folder. A prompt should appear warning you that a file already exists in this folder with the same name. Don't worry! Rename your new file ""autoexec.cfg"". Step 7 Right click your new file and open it with Notepad or any other non-format text edit application. Now delete everything you see. Step 8 Write down all your custom configurations and save the file. You've now successfully written your autoexec file and you can now focus on writing special binds. For a jumpthrow bind, you will need an alias as the key you are binding will execute multiple actions when pressed. Step 1 In your ""autoexec.cfg"" file, you will want to type out the following: alias ""+jumpthrow"" ""+jump;-attack"" alias ""-jumpthrow"" ""-jump"" bind z ""+jumpthrow"" You may replace ""z"" with any key on your keyboard for the jumpthrow. Step 2 Now that your autoexec file defines your jumpthrow bind, you will need this file to be run every time CS:GO boots up. Same as earlier, find CS:GO in your Steam library. Right click the game or left click the gear icon. Look for an option called ""Properties"". Step 3 A menu should now open. Under a tab called ""General"", you will find a box labelled ""LAUNCH OPTIONS Advanced users may choose to enter modifications to their launch options."" Step 4 Left click the empty box and type out the following: +exec autoexec.cfg Step 5 You can now close everything and run CS:GO. Check out your new jumpthrow bind!",0.021,0.902,0.077,0.9759,2

I'm a superior gamer and a better person compared to you, so I typed out a small list of tips you can keep in mind. Please read closely: Counter-Strike Global Offensive (CS:GO) is one of the oldest and most popular FPS titles on PC. The game is free to play, though you cannot play ranked (Prime Status) until you either play your way to it or pay £15 to purchase access to it. What is CS:GO? Couter-Strike Global Offensive is, at its heart, a first person shooter, or ‘FPS’. Ultimately, CS:GO is a competitive, 30 round team-based shooter. It puts two teams against each other, with one team planting the bomb, and the others aiming to either defuse it or stop it from being planted. The two teams are split into teams of five and spend 15 rounds each playing as attackers and defenders. You start the game with $800 and earn money by killing enemy players, planting/defusing the bomb, and winning the round. You then use this money to buy better weapons and equipment to win future rounds. The first team to win 16 rounds is the winner. While the game has many other modes now, including its own take on the popular Battle Royale genre, CS:GO has always been about the core bomb planting and defusing gameplay. What are the Player Roles in CS:GO? Players will tend to fit into a number of different roles as they play CS:GO and improve. Entry fragger – This is for players that are quick on the trigger, and are able to take the all-important one-v-one. ￼ In-Game Leader – This is not the sort of role you’ll aim to go for first, however, if you know the maps you can be the play caller for your side. Support – Playing alongside the entry fragger, support players will assist the entry player with flashes and smokes, as well as cleaning up if they die. Lurk/Stealth – The lurker is your team’s flanking player. Look to sneak behind the enemy team or maybe solo plant the bomb at the opposite bomb site to your team. AWPer/Sniper – One of the most important roles in CS:GO How to Play CS:GO CS:GO is a dynamic game when compared to other popular multiplayer games (See our LoL Beginner’s Guide here). With CS:GO, no one is assigned one of the above roles, it’s more that as a team you’ll naturally fall into them. Be that defending a certain site, or being your team’s AWPer. The ultimate goal of the game is to get to 16 round victories, by winning rounds on either the Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist side. What side you start is random, though it will have an impact on if you’re in the early game advantage or not. Classically certain maps are more favoured to one side, so if you fall behind on one side, make sure not to lose your head. To win, you’ll need to work as a team, manage your economy, and make individual decisions that see your team come out on top. Though, the first point, teamwork, is the most important if you want to move onto ranked CS:GO. If you want some pro tips, Valve (the game’s developer) made a series of videos on their YouTube that might help. While these are old, these tips are still as relevant as ever. ￼ How to Step Up your CS:GO Game with Tips and Tricks Once you’ve got a feel for CS:GO, it’s time to step up to the next level. Here are some useful tips and tricks as you move into ranked play: Practice: if you want to get good at CS:GO, you’ll need to play it. Join gun-game servers to practice the full arsenal of weapons or join Deathmatch servers to get better at reaction fragging. Aim training software: A simple search on Steam for Aim Training will yield countless results of games/software that are focused on improving your aim, and you won’t have to spend a penny. Focus on the core weapons: AK-47 (T) and M4A4 (CT) are key weapons to learn and get used to as you start out. Focus on using these, then move on to the more advanced and specialist ones. Check your bullets and don’t get killed reloading: One of the tips the game tells you early on is “it’s faster to swap to your pistol than it is to reload”. if you’re in a tight spot and low on ammo, remember that reloading makes a sound, and you might get pushed. You can also use this to your advantage by reloading and cancelling it to bait players to you. Get good headphones and listen to sounds: Sound is a key mechanic in CS:GO, knowing how close players are to you and what gun people are using is key to your victory. Learn these sounds and use them to your advantage. Learn the four common ranked maps: The four main maps in CS:GO are; Mirage, Inferno, Dust 2, and Nuke. Learn these maps (preferably one at a time), find spots that you can hide, smoke, and learn how the enemy might attack or defend bomb sites. Communicate with your team: Talking to your team is a necessity. While you don’t need to be an in-game general, telling your team where enemy players are can save your team valuable seconds and might just be the difference between a round win or a loss. Do not rush into ranked: CS:GO is a tough nut to crack. Having been out for a long time, the game has a lot of highly skilled players. Take time to learn and get used to the game before getting your feet wet. Start watching CS:GO Esports and learn from the best: We’ll explain more below, however, CS:GO has a wealth of professional talent that play on an almost daily basis. Either watch pro events or pro players on Twitch to help you improve. What is CS:GO Esports? So you’ve learnt to play CS:GO yourself, and you think you’ve got it mastered, now’s the time to look at the pro players. So what is Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) Esports? Simply put, CS:GO Esports is one of the largest, and longest reaching in all of esports. Played across the entire globe, you’re just as likely to find a Championship-winning side from South America and North America, as you are from Europe or Asia. While Europe has often been the most successful, other regions are always hot on their heels. CS:GO Esports is a lot less organized by the game’s developer than a lot of other esports titles are.. With CS:GO, third-party organizations run almost everything, from providers such as ESL, BLAST, IEM, and DreamHack to name just a few. While in recent years, organizations such as ESL and Flashpoint have looked to create franchised leagues more like what we’re used to with American Sports. And that’s about all there is to know to get you started with CS:GO. Seek out groups, make friends, and watch YouTube videos/Twitch streams of professional players and you’ll be on the right track to improving.",0.062,0.765,0.173,0.9992,-2

I learned how to really have impact opposed to the friends I play with now that are used to have a 5 stack. Some of them have high k/d but no impact and when they soloq they have high k/d but lose whereas I will not topfrag but have impact. Always look for the win condition. ""I got a triple kill so it isnt my fault"" is not a winning mindset. Killing the one bombplanter with 5 seconds left however is. Key to grinding up is to keep honing your skills. Have the same setup. Warmup shooting bots for 10mins and deathmatch for 30. Train to have clean aim while doing it. Go for headshots cleanly and try not to miss. You can have all the kills in deathmatch but if you train your muscle memory inconsistently it will reflect to whiffs in-game. Learn simple nade line-ups and call to your teammates what nade you are throwing. For example smoke coffins and god-flash your team into B inferno while calling ""coffins smoked, wait for god-flash"". In soloQ managing teammates can be difficult. If ur team is agressive and you want to play passive try to communicate that. If they still want to be aggressive you can support them with utility without exposing yourself. Also if they are passive and you need to be more agressive call ""I entry B, flash me into CT"". Look at what your team needs and be the one that makes it work for the win.

People learned how to utilize the skills optimally. I was still doing well but it was much harder as I couldn't use the abilities as well as the others. A few more months passed. When I played it again, I was outplayed every match. My aim no longer was enough to win fights. It has a different meta and abilities are key. At a high level, you can't win with aim alone in either game. Because on average, everybody has good aim. In CS you make the difference with strategy, executions and teamwork. In Valo you need to master the abilities, the meta and teamwork, and dare I say it has more space for individual creativity based on abilities. And if you switch from Valorant to CS you will find that you don't know the pop-flashes, smoke lineups etc. So no, you are not going to switch from either game to the other and blitz your way through unless stomping silvers counts.

Enable auto weapon pickups so you press G to drop your weapon and automatically pickup whatever is on the ground. That way you can keep your crosshair trained on where the enemies will come instead of having to look down and press E. Enable music so you know when there are 10 seconds left on bomb. Side mouse buttons should be used as an extra key-bind. I use them to cycle through grenades. Plant bomb in a spot thats tough for them to defuse. For example up against the wall on Dust 2 B. That forces them to look down and at a wall when they defuse making it harder for them to defend themselves. Know your economy and enemy economy. This applies to the decision of whether to buy helmets (do not buy helmets versus AWP/AK47). Shotguns have more kill reward than rifles. Knives have the highest kill reward. Know where your teammates with defuse kits died so you can pick it up. Play with your team, even if you disagree with their strategy. Especially important not to be fucking around all alone because if you die you will need go trade kills and they can’t do that if you’re all alone. Spray transfer is an important skill. So is knowing recoil pattern. So is knowing playstyle with every gun. For example Swag-7 is actually pretty accurate when jumpshotting, while M4 and AK are not. Five seven has decent armor penetration, USP and glock do not (pistols are super important skill because winning save rounds is hugely important). Know how to go up ladders quickly.

I bought this computer for music production and ended up getting addicted to csgo) So I just got the model d mouse from glorious. Prior to this I was using a cheap, shitty office mouse that I don't know the dpi of. Before I got this new mouse I was playing on a sens of 3.6, which I knew was a little high, but it felt comfortable to me. I adjusted the dpi of this new mouse until it felt relatively similar at the same sense. So I'm using 1600 dpi at a 3.6 sense which is extremely high, but feels comfortable to me. I want to get better at the game, and so I'm wondering whether I should lower my dpi and sense to near what everyone else uses, but it just doesn't feel natural to me especially since my mousepad is so small. I do plan on getting a way bigger mouse pad though. Do you think continuing to play at this ridiculously high sensitivity will hinder my gameplay?",0.059,0.816,0.125,0.9059,6
1663201788,2022-09-15,"I never understood how people can play high sensitivity. I think i got influenced by my friend who had really low sensitivity and was really good at the game. Almost all the pros back then used lower sensitive with low DPI. I think i have 400dpi 1.3 sensitivity. And sometimes when i have bad matches i make it 1.2 or 1.1 and my aim feels better, more precise. I have a big mousepad 40x50cm. If you use a low sensitive your hand might hurt after playing a lot but you get used to it. I always felt like my aim is more precise and accurate with more control using low sensitive. It's personal preference, i have seen pros using high sensitivity too. I think you should use a sensitive comfortable to turn around, which means if someone shoot in your back you can turn around in one swipe, that's why bigger mousepad is the key. My conclusion is that if you want to improve in precision, accuracy, more control... definitely lower your sensitivity and buy a bigger mousepad.

I feel like my flicks are better, I'm hitting one taps/one deags better (I could never do a one tap on high sense). I probably increased 2-3 kills during a short match, which is quite a lot all things considered. My advice is either buy a bigger mouse pad, or get a desk pad that you put your keyboard and everything on. Basically it's one bit massive mouse pad (I use the JayzTwoCents one because I like the design, with nice quality too).

What is your sensitivity in game and your mouse dpi, (dots per inch) if you don’t know what it is there should be a button on your mouse that makes it go faster or slower, it’s called a dpi shifter. The reason I mention it is because a lot of people play on 800-1000 dpi and they don’t know they higher the faster there mouse will respond and you’ll click the enemy’s head so much better. Also, download aim lab if you can it’s free and help me so much, but give it time it’s so easy to feel like the aim trainer is hard so game hard, been der but just take it slow I say point at them correct and then shoot most just point then shoot, if you learn to correct then shoot you’ll start to hit so many more shots it’s crazy so just remember point/aim quick- correct fast aim- shoot. Not point/aim quick- shoot, makes a huge difference. Also from my small experience in csgo there’s so many peaks but some basic ones are wide and quick peak, it integrally matters which you do or your enemy does. A quick peak is while you’re moving from out behind a cover before you fully stop and before you even show yourself almost you hit the other key and go back so they can’t shoot you and you have info on there where snouts, but wide peak you go way beyond the cover to miss where there cross hair is and they need to correct, but hopefully you do first while your walking out, also that’s what I imagine people are doing to you because it’s so hard to run and gun if you’re not right up on them or lucky as hell.

Imo: Val fixes a lot of issues with CSGO, such as much better smokes. Val adds new things like quirky maps and agents with unique abilities, which I think adds a larger fun aspect, but takes away from the competitive environment that CSGO achieves through being very bare bones. Valorant is also missing the community servers, mapping, etc that made CSGO such a good game in the first place, which I think will hurt its ability to grow and evolve in the long run.

1664661003,2022-10-01,"Since you are coming from Valorant, you'll probably have a decent enough idea on how to play in a tactical shooter. The main two things I would recommend, like a lot of others, are the workshop maps aim\_botz and recoil\_master. Use aim\_botz to get used to counter strafing and just general aim training (tho I'd assume your valo-aim should carry over) Use recoil\_master to learn recoil. I recommend playing with the settings ""Movement lock"", ""Nospread"" and ""T-Target"" enabled. Put on some music and try to spray on the Ts head (set the sound to be barely audible, otherwise its gonna be really uncomfortable for your ears after a while). Do \~15 bullet sprays at first. They are the most important and the easiest. Practice mainly with the AK and m4a1s (you might have to equip this one in your loadout as well). When using the T-Target, you should get a little statistic in the chat after every clip. You should aim for about 50% head-accuracy. Its gonna take a while, probably a few sessions, but you'll get there. As for playing against other players, deathmatch is a good place to start. Choose an ak and intentionally go for headshots as much as you can. Casual mode is also nice to get a feel for how to play in a round-based environment. It should be noted that you should treat every round in casual as a must win, no saving guns. It doesn't really matter who wins the match, just who wins each round. Before you start playing competative, play a (few) game(s) against bots on the same maps you want to play later. This will teach you both the layout and give you some idea where you can expect to encounter enemies. More things: * Use the shift key. When an enemy can hear you move, you are an easy target. Try to give away your position as little as possible * If you have the chance to reposition after a kill, do so. If you think you can hit a timing and move somewhere your opponents don't expect, do it. Essentially making A decision is usually more important than making the best decision. If you just hang around passively, more often then not the enemy has the upper hand. * Don't bait your team. You don't always have to be the first one to go in, but if someone else goes in, don't hesitate. Nothing is more infuriating than getting an entry and dying just to see your teammates haven't moved into site with you. * Make an effort to learn callouts. Its not the end of the world if you don't know everything, but if you hear someone make one and you don't know what it means, look it up later. Also communicate it if you have useful info * Learn how to use utility. I don't think it is as essential as others here seem to think. At the start, buying utility is usually just a waste of your money. Learn the mechanics of how to use them, maybe learn some basic lineups.

1664814425,2022-10-03,"So female dolphins have vaginal secretions that make a male dolphin just cum over and over and over. From this point on, I will call these secretions Dolphin pussy jelly. Scientists were like ""holy shit, dude we gotta test this. You know, for science"" So the scientists collected a sample of said dolphin pussy jelly, and had a test primate. They swabbed it on the male primate's dick, sat back and watched the show. Now you see, it worked. But it worked a little too well. The monkey straight up had a heart attack because it used all of its energy into fucking cumming. I want to live in a world where this is a commercial product. I want to say ""you know what, I want to die and i know what to do about it."" I want to live in a world where i can go into my local grocery store, pick up a bottle of Smucker's Dolphin Pussy Jelly, and just fucking cum myself to death There are various ways a dolphin has of showing that she or he is interested in sex. Males are probably the easiest to detect. They will swim around, sporting an erection (anywhere between 10 to 14 inches long for a Bottle-nose), and will have no bones about swimming up to you and placing their member within reach of your hand. If you are in the water, they may rub it along any part of your body, or wrap it around your wrist or ankle. (Dolphin males have a prehensile penis. They can wrap it around objects, and carry them as such.) Their belly will also be pinkish in colour, which also denotes sexual excitement. Females can be a little harder. The most obvious way a female dolphin has of displaying her sexual interest is the pink-belly effect. Their genitals become very pink and swollen, making the genital region very prominent. They may be restless, or they may be acting as normal. If you are out of the water, they may swim up to you and roll belly up, exposing themselves to you, coupled with pelvic thrusts. If you are in the water, they may press their genitals up against yours, nibble your fingers, nuzzle your crotch, or do pelvic thrusts against you. Each dolphins way of expressing sexual readiness varies, so the longer you know the dolphin, the better you will detect when they are sexually active. When a male dolphin is interested in you, about the only thing you can do, if you are male, is to masturbate him. (Unfortunately, I cannot speak for the female of the human species... it seems women just don't like dolphins enough...) WARNING! You should NEVER let a male dolphin attempt anal sex with you. The Bottle-nose dolphin member is around 12 inches, very muscular, and the thrusting and the force of ejaculation (A male can cum as far as 14 feet) would cause serious internal injuries, resulting in peritonitus and possible death. A male dolphin's member is roughly S-shaped, tapered at the end. If you are in the water with them, it is best to support the dolphin on his side, just under the water, with one hand, and handle him with the other. Male dolphins, I find, tend to prefer the base of the penis to be gently massaged and squeezed, as well as gently rubbed along it's length. It feels very much like the rest of the dolphin (ie. smooth and rubbery to the touch, but firmer). It doesn't take long for the male to ejaculate, around 40 seconds to a minute, and this is usually accompanied by either shuddering just prior to ejaculating, and thrusting and tail-arching during ejaculation. The force of ejaculation can be powerful at times, so it is best to keep your face out of the line of fire, or keep his member underwater. You can attempt to lick and suck on the end of it while masturbating as well, but be warned, do not try to give full throat, and get the hell out of the way before he ejaculates! A male dolphin could snap your neck in an accidental thrust, and that would be the end of that relationship. Well, the females are again a little trickier. There are two courses of action with a female fin: Masturbation, or mating. Masturbation: Female dolphins, once they show interest in you, can be supported in much the same way as the male, one hand under the fin, supporting her, the other doing the stimulating. The clitoris of the female is located at the top of the genital slit, and is a prominent lump when erect. You can rub this with your finger tips, or lick and suck it, but with the oral aspect, you might end up with a bruised nose as they thrust up into you. You can slide your hand gently into their genital opening, and feel around inside, rubbing gently. They feel warm and muscular inside, their labia like tough, squishy sponge when they are excited. Don't be surprised if they start to play with your hand inside them. They have very manipulative muscles, and can use them to carry and manipulate objects, including your hand. (They can do things that would make a regular human woman turn green with envy.) Their climax is coupled with stiffening, shuddering, sometimes a lot of thrusting, clinching of the vaginal muscles, and sometimes vocalisation. Mating: This is harder. Obviously, being human, it is awkward, but not impossible to mate in open water. It is easier to have the dolphin in a shallow area (like the shallows just off the beach) around 1 1/2 to 2 feet deep. This is usually comfortable enough for both the dolphin and you. Gently, you should roll the dolphin on her side, so she is lying belly-towards you. You can prop yourself up on an elbow, and lie belly to belly against her. You may want to use the other arm to gently hold her close, and place the tip of your member against her genital slit. She will, if interested, arch her body up against you, taking you inside her body. There is usually a fair bit of wriggling and shifting, usually to get comfortable, both outside and inside. Once comfortable, though, females initiate a series of muscular vaginal contractions that rub the entire length of your member. They may also thrust rhythmically against you, so enjoy the experience while you can, since you will rarely last longer that a minute or two. Just prior to her climaxing, she will up the speed of her contractions and thrusts. It is interesting to note that the times I have mated with females, thay have timed their orgasm to mine. Whether they do this consciously or not, I do not know, but it is a great feeling to have two bodies shuddering against each other at the one time. One thing to note. Whether you masturbate or mate a dolphin, male or female, always spend time with them afterwards. Cuddle them, rub them, talk to them and most importantly, and show them you love them. This is essential, as it helps to strengthen the bond between you. Like a way of saying that this wasn't just a one night fling. The dolphins appreciate it, and they will want your company more the next time you visit them.",0.051,0.784,0.165,0.9994,2

There was no “localisation” of the game yet. I was young and very confused (I didn’t even know qwerty keyboards were a thing!) and arrows seemed way more logical to me. I also liked the space around the arrows, it allowed me to feel where I’m at. I always felt keys were too close on a wasd config. But since 99% are comfortable with WASD I’m sure I would get used to it eventually. Now if we want to go into even more details, as I got better and needed more binds (jumpthrows, running jumpthrows, grenades) I think I’m actually at a disadvantage. First of all I don’t have enough keys. I don’t know where to put the running jumpthrow bind. Few lineups though and I mostly play casual so not that important. The biggest problem is my walking key (page end from memory. I’m on my mobile rn). This means I use my index finger to walk and then twist my wrist to use my thumb to press strafe right and it doesn’t work so well. In MM you walk a lot more than in casual and I can genuinely say it has been a problem at time. I still made it to LE so I can leave with that. Second problem is my thumb is “wasted” by having no use most of the time. Whereas on a WASD config you jump with space I believe? + plenty other keys available on the row above space.

This way you can get away from the low trustfactor and start wanting to climb the ladder legit and start spending more and more time playing the game legit. I have never had this type of problem so I have no idea how to get away from it, but I would assume getting into the habit of always trying to play legit on your “legit account” will help you get more comfortable playing like everyone else. The key part is to NEVER cheat on that account. I hope it works out for you and good for you in trying to get better! :) PS: You’re gonna probably suck ass when you’re playing legit so get comfortable with that fact and try watching guides and practice a lot and you’ll surely find the game more enjoyable that way!

Some key areas will most likely be: Crosshair placement - this is a-o for time to damage and headshot % Proper counter-strafing important mechanic to understand for accuracy and control. Utility usage - check your UD damage each game and try to improve by strategic nades etc. also leetify will give you info on flashes and more. Spray control - understand the patterns and use practise maps. https://dmarket.com/blog/csgo-spray-patterns/ Time to damage - improve your reflexes and do speed aim training maps.

As much as people hate valo and it using user data, you can't really argue the fact that its anti-cheat IS really damn good. &amp;#x200B; One thing I never got people trying to argue this point with ""oh well they do still get cheaters lol"" it's like saying mac gets viruses. Like they do, but its not only extremely rare, it's easy to fix and with a team of developers that actively seek out cheaters, it's one of the only games where cheaters get banned nearly at the start or halfway through the match, which means your elo doesn't go down and your hidden mmr isn't affected, meaning cheaters in valo, unlike cs, siege, overwatch or any of those games have next to no effect on actual players. It's a terrible thing with cs, and Valve is taking the long route to defeating cheaters, and although vacnet and overwatch IS getting better, and probably will make cheating a lot harder, if not nearly impossible, the road for that to happen is very long, and by the time Valve finally manages it, most of the playerbase will have moved on by then and csgo will become TOO outdated. Unless Valve stops paying most of their attention onto Dota 2 and VR, csgo (and even tf2) will always be in the sidelines, especially since Dota 2 is like a quarter of Valve's profit and tf2/csgo barely meet 10%, even if it hurts them, it doesn't really matter for the higher ups to focus on fixing csgo's biggest issues, especially when Valve has a system where your pay is depending on how important investors/higher ups deem your job, which is mostly why tf2's team is so low and csgo recieves less attention compared to VR and Dota 2, simply the employee's get paid less. I have cheated, and I now have been getting back to being clean as I've been playing faceit and have a friend watch me play match-making on desktop mode in a discord call (with my webcam on my keyboard and mouse too), I noticed that me cheating, as much as I blame myself for it, isn't really 100% the fault of my own when Valve doesn't care much and even rewards cheaters at times, along with no hwid bans, and yes hwid-gens exist, I think anything that can act as a deterrent will be great. &amp;#x200B; Idk since I made this post to now, I realized how dumb of a post this was and how regardless of if people cheat or not, Valve's not gonna give a shit, so I opted to just abandon match-making for the most part and just work on leveling up in faceit instead, it's more fun anyways, and the toxicity of faceit is overstated, it's actually not that bad. I met a few people on there too! &amp;#x200B; TL;DR - Valve bad, matchmaking bad, use face-it and i won't feel suicidal and go on a cheating rampage.",0.167,0.688,0.145,-0.9536,1
1669484075,2022-11-26,"One jiggle-peek or a good popflash and the awper is gone from that angle and you've gained real-estate on the map. And the awp is wayy less forgiving than a rifle. It's one-shot but only to roughly 60-65% of the model, you have to chamber another bullet, wait for it to be accurate(approx. 300ms for optimal accuracy) and you also have to take Counter Strike's peekers advantage into consideration. Say you've been posted on the same angle for an extended period of time, then by default, as time progresses, several other external factors come into play. Like for instance you checking radar, getting flashed, getting your position smoked off and having to reposition further back if playing a defensive role, which will inevitably be less optimal because it gives the aggressors the opportunity to gain more control of the map. It's also balanced out by the slow movement speed, 4750$ price tag and CQB is immensely difficult with it.

The mic is more than sufficient and the build quality is very good overall. Right now I'm sporting the wireless edition which is a tad more expensive, but really nice. The only issue i have with it is that the chord included for charging is so short you can't wear it whilst its charging. Quickfix is to buy a longer cable separately. For csgo you really don't need a God tier headset, nor do you need a good mic. Just remember to tell him not to use the 7.1 surround function on the cloud 2. Hehe. If budget is out the window though the best way to go about it is to buy a standalone microphone with either a sturdy stand (if your bf has a big desk with space between his keyboard and chest) or one with a stand that can be mounted at the back or sides of said desk. Any standalone mic is better than a headphone mic, the cloud 2's mic is even removable which is great for when you have a separate mic.

I have about 100 friends who play CS which I can always message whenever I want to play, also helps if you ever lose your rank and want to play with a stack. -Don’t play maps like agency unless you have a full team, people troll on it often. I seriously doubt these players were not trolling being on this. -Play less. I found my best climbing was done on my first 2-4 games of the week. If you’ve played two and won both of them, quit whilst you are ahead. Set yourself a ‘two losses and I’m done for the day/week -Aim training. Even if it’s just hopping into a death match for two games prior to playing, you’ll be better for it. I’d rather play 2 death matches and 2 comp games than 3/4 comp games of a worse quality. -unbind your leaderboard key/put it at a far to reach place, mine is on my backspace key and I probably check once a match. You’ll find yourself less tilted and playing better yourself, if you have enough MVPs the MMR loss is somewhat mitigated and a win is worth more. -Talk less. Just essential comms. If people are toxic mute them and ping/chat. Talking can just cause more drama. -If people are playing awfully try to take on the role of IGL, this is a last ditch attempt as it can cause people to tilt. But word it well and it will cause less offence. They may be playing bad but as long as they entry onto site and let you trade you can play effectively.

There is only so far you can go in the ranks with bad teams. If teammates don't attempt/succeed at trades, you lose. If teammates don't know what angles to watch/hold and you get shot in the back, you lose. If teammates keep peaking shit they shouldn't and keep getting picked, you lose. If they have the gamesense of a Spider Monkey tripping on LSD, you lose. If they just straight up don't even know the basics of the game, such as right-hand peak advantage, or that quick reloading isn't a thing, or that shots aren't as accurate if you're spam firing, you lose. There is only so much you can do when you have teammates like that. You are right about the ""just focus on improving your own game"" part, though. That's exactly what I've been doing. I've stopped relying on teammates. I treat every single situation like it's a 1v5, because if I rely on my team for anything at all, chances are they'll let me down.

Gunshots suppress footsteps, blowing your cover isn’t the end of the world. 2) Kinda leads into 1, you don’t react when your team is getting shot and let them die for info/just are scared to trade/peak. It’s almost always better to trade/flank than be passive. Way harder to handle a 2v1 than 2 1v1s. 3) Team calls a strategy and you just ignore it or it’s like a B rush and you just sit upper runs. Team is pushing on a split and you don’t push your split, this can easily cause a otherwise good split to fall apart. 4) CT side you play positions that are just crouched in a corner on an off angle waiting the whole round. This unfortunately can often get you a kill or two so it might seem like it’s working but if your not throwing util/getting intel/map pressure it’s potentially baiting if you’re losing sites/mid control. There’s a time and place for passive/stealthy gameplay and it’s a hard balance. Especially in Mm when you can go push to help your teammate and then they run away, it is tempting to bait. Sometimes you just have impossible teammates who will push every round on CT and die taking 3v1s mid or just will bait the fuck outta you and never push a site so it’s very situation dependent. Typically MM play is a lot of passive/baiting/scared plays, it’s rare to find a team that’ll all push together/trade well.",0.102,0.816,0.082,-0.8355,1

While possible, not missing one shot at that distance is hard to do ... but let an aimbot do the work and your chances go up significantly. The RNG of the deagle (the cone effect) at that distance also is in play. So to give him the highest accuracy of hitting his intended target, it could be locking center-mass of the head. We'd never be able to see it forensically, because his red dot is bigger than the pixel he's locking to. However, these synth locks, when they do happen, are perfect.

At higher ranks you’ll need to know a few lineups per map, but more importantly throwing util on the fly and supporting teammates mid round/post plant.

Even SoloQ, try creative stuff that you wouldn’t normally try in a game, if you lose? Who cares, it’s wingman. -Have util bound to specific keys -actually put time into learning rifles/awp pistols/deagle. YPrac maps have setting to show where bullet inaccuracy while moving.

That is the beauty of a team sport. You may play a different position, or have a different skillset, but every player on the field is abiding by the same mechanics and governing rules. This is the basis of the idea of an e-sport. Imagine taking ice hockey except now one player is allowed to use two sticks, one player is allowed to hold opposing players as much as they want, and one player is allowed to bring a bunch of fake pucks onto the ice to try to deceive the other team. One guy is the designated ""tripper"" who can't get a penalty for tripping, and the final guy is allowed to dislodge his own net from the moorings once per 2 minutes. You've taken a pure sport wherein everyone is on equal footing, and you've added complete randomness to it. You've made TikTok hockey or some shit.

These scammers impersonate profiles using advanced bots. So, to the less-experienced eye, the bots appear to be 'real' accounts. Brace yourselves, here's the tricky bit! How does the API Scam work? During a trade, you must complete the following steps: Send the trade offer Confirm via your mobile device Wait for the other party to accept. The API Scam occurs during Step 2, when users are prompted to confirm the offer. Using access to the API Key, scammers cancel the offer you sent, clone the trading partners profile (using the same name and profile picture!) and send a counter-offer for your item.

1677714334,2023-03-01,"Its hard to put into one comment considering how different the tactics are, but a couple points off the top of my head: - learn maps and map timings inside and out. You want to be able to predict where enemies are by timing alone, and which walls/corners/props can be shot through and how well. - Wallbang not so much for kills, but for info, for area-denial and for aim-punch. For example, I play a lot of Nuke, and from lobby, I can shoot into the corner of trophy. Damage is very low, but I can watch for blood particles and hit sounds. Or if my team is pushing through squeaky, I can shoot through the wall of hut to throw off the aim of anyone hiding Tetris. - your footstep audability isn't determined by your walk/sprint inputs but by speed. This also doesn't change with weapn, so if you move at a speed between walk and sprint (either by feathering the walk key, or by try-harding and setting up an analog movement option) you can move silently at a normal speed rather than the Negev's slow speed. - Pick your fights carefully. If the enemy can headshot you before you get four or five shots off, you lose the fight. Basically, they have a good two-thirds of a second that you're harmless, so you need to pick fights to minimize this, such as ambushing them, shooting them through corners/cover. - Use large bursts, but be cognizant of your remaining shots and the tracers you fire. You'll want to make sure you fire enough to kill your target (or suppress them, or block a doorway) but if you run out of ammo and the round isn't already decided, you're probably dead with the loud, slow reload. It can even be worth firing in short bursts if you're not likely to need to kill immediately. In the same vein, firing too long through an obsticle or smoke will let them locate and return fire easily as the tracers are very visible. Don't be afraid to fire short bursts to poke at the enemy and reposition if the situation calls for it. - Negev is cheap. Perfect for buying extra util or guns for teammates. Make use of this.

So if you had an older version of CS already, like 1.6 or Source, it uses the purchase date; if you didn’t buy the game from Steam, but instead input a CD key, it likely uses that date.

1679535853,2023-03-23,"I’ll try to be brief: change the word “tick” for “check”. So, a check rate of 64 means the server checks for what is happening on clients 64 times each second. Now let’s go for a small number: 1/4 or 0.25. That means, of course, the server will check for things once every 4 seconds. Now, if you shot on second 1, server will replicate your action to other clients after 3 seconds, creating some weird delay between the moment you shot and the moment the server thinks you have shot. That’s how typically servers work even in modern games and even if someone is hosting the game (the host is the client and also the server). Now with the change: it could actually change a lot of things, and not only for csgo. Details are not there yet, but my bet is that the server is no longer checking every X seconds but instead processing the request as soon as it is done. More “tech-ish” info: Server-client communication is no longer being limited by how many communications do they need to “create”, but instead it works based on events (key pressed, key released),which means when you press “w”, server will understand you are moving and WONT need any updates on that until you release the key. So now that’s 2 communications in X seconds, instead of 64/128 every second. Now, I do think they are kinda lying to us in the matter that there will still be some tick on it to check if server and client are synced properly (position and rotation).

So with regards to impact fragging, the most important kills are going to be: kills that win a round (duh) bearing in mind that clutch kills will be more impactful; kills that open a bomb site (killing a defender, especially if you can do this quickly); killing the entry fragger; opening frags; killing someone who limits the rotation (e.g. a lurker); and killing someone with a priority gun like an AWP who may be trying to save (especially if you kill them when they are T, and killing after the round ends since they get no money). Low impact frags would be inconsequential kills like a meaningless kill at the end of a round or a round winning frag in one where you have basically won it. You want as many of your frags to be high impact, since they will win you more rounds and therefore games. I didn't realise you were talking about casual play, I played competitive. So your focus on moving is to give yourself the biggest advantage with duels and find information as to where they are or aren't. You slow walk to conceal your movement, but the issue with it is that you would peek really slowly and give yourself a disadvantage in a gunfight. You need to quick peek but make sure you're checking each common angle so if they are there, you can easily kill them. It is somewhat similar, but the key difference is that since you don't have abilities, the fundamentals become more important; learning how to stop your movement to immediately fire accurately is critical, and keeping your gun at head height makes killing that much quicker. This somewhat reverses when dealing with AWPs, and varies when you're facing things like pistols, but the general idea holds. I'd really recommend TheWarOwl's stuff on this, he does a lot of videos teaching the fundamentals of CSGO, and while some stuff will undoubtably have changed, it will still generally hold true. EDIT: Learn the power of staying alive as well. If you're a CT, and your site is getting pushed, staying alive for even 5 more seconds gives your team so much more to work with. Being able to save a gun can swing a round later on, and it makes the opponent's life a misery if they have to work hard for each frag.",0.175,0.698,0.128,-0.9769,1

Buff163 is the largest volume site by far so the skin would sell fastest, but the caveat is that it's run by Chinese and you can't directly withdraw money. That's why you withdraw TF2 Keys, which are used as currency, and sell them on a third-party site like Skinport that you can directly get money from.

Sure, you might have done the best overall, but you could definetely have done something else to change the outcome. Strategy/adaptability/mechanics/gamesense. U have all 3 things yourself. Usually, even if your team is not communicating, you can still find ways to better the outcome of the game. Adapting to your enviroment is key. You cant play cs like you would 5-stacking when soloqueing. The game will be completely different. Strategy is key too. You cant make a strategy with the team in this case, but you can make one for yourself. Mechanichs are the last yet just as important key. How good are you individually? Can you hit good shots? Mix these 3 together, and you will find a way to make the best use of yourself on any team.

Zipel has a discord where they price things but I don’t have it and this doesn’t look like any overpay really unless the float is at least 0.00**********. Otherwise depending on the country you reside in there are different options for you to sell your skin. You can go to a website; I recommend skinbid since it’s zipels site but I’m not sure how active it is. You can also check out bitskins but they only do crypto so they’ll be fees for withdrawing your crypto to your bank account plus whatever commission it takes from skinbid. The only time I’ve sold skins for real cash was heyzeus. He buys skins for 85% market value through bank transfer. I consider him, anomaly, ohnepixel, and zipel to be some of the most trustworthy for buying skins. One of the most important things to keep in mind if you’re trading for money is that before any trade you make check your steam api key and make sure nobody created one for you. This can happen when you log into a phishing site that is meant to copy steam’s log in page. The best way to combat this is before logging into any steam affiliated site first log into steam’s official community market in browser.

I rather use a whitelisted site like SkinPort, DMarket, SkinBaron or BitSkins. P2P can be good if it’s through something like CSGOFloat and DMarket’s Face2Face system. There needs to verification and accountability for these trades if someone isn’t acting on good faith. Also, keep an eye on API scams. I had someone on my friends list try to get me to join a tournament and phish my Steam credentials all the while asking for me to sell one of my items on a marketplace to buy. It wasn’t till I noticed I had an unknown API key generated and they were planing on using to cancel and swap my trade offer to the marketplace site to theirs.

I am not sure of all the possibilities that can be done with an api key but in steam its commonly used to automate trades, a common api scam key can be acquired by logging into a malicious site with your steam account, they have limited access to your account, and place an api key on it. Most people dont even know about it so it stays hidden until you trade your skins to a site to sell or to a friend, after you sent the trade, before confirming it on the authenticator, an account mimics the receiving persons profile name and picture and resends the trade. TLDR: its very deceptive and it tricks a lot of people to accept the trade which was rerouted to the scammers bot account automatically. You can type/copy this into a browser and click on the official steam website: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey Is the link but i recommend searching for it yourself You should have the option of adding an api key with a text box.

1684287546.0,2023-05-17,"I appreciate the statistical analysis here but this misses some key details about what that 15ms actually affects. To be clear, having a lower interpolation period does not mean that the server will consider your shots to land before the opponents. The server processes shots in the order they arrive, and considers the interpolation period and latency of the client to roll back the state of the world before processing hits. So if someone with an interpolation period of 30ms sends a shot which kills you to the server before your kill shot reaches the server, it doesn't matter whether your shot occurred first in the interp and lag adjusted timeline. You'll already be dead according to the server. So that 15ms is not going to decrease your absolute time to kill, especially not in a ""fair fight"" where both players are aware of each other and are out in the open, or are equal distance from the cover they are peaking, etc. The only thing it affords you is an *information* advantage in very specific circumstances. For example, if a player comes out of cover into your view then you will see that occur 15ms sooner then someone with a 30 ms interp period. This may allow you to start shooting sooner, meaning that your shots may reach the server that much sooner. However, if that player is peaking you and you are stationary they still likely have many other strong advantages that make that 15ms a total wash anyway. If you are stationary, their client already knows you're there and they will see you as soon as they peek out. If they are peeking further from the corner than you are holding it, then they will see your body before you see their head. If they prefire properly, none of this matters anyway because their shot will already be on its way to the server and you'll be dead before you even know it. Not to mention the fact that you are reacting to the information, and they are coordinating their movement and shots. I'm sure we can come up with circumstances where the 15ms information advantage actually provides a meaningful advantage. However my main point is that it is so marginal for so many other reasons that its not going to make a meaningful difference except to the most advanced players in limited circumstances. On the other hand, having a bit of irregular network delays in a critical fight causing your view of the world to jump around is likely to throw off most players. So it's really not good advice to set the ratio to 1. The advantage is most likely a wash compared to so many other real factors, and the risk of jumpy game play at critical moments increases.",0.112,0.787,0.101,-0.9265,1

1685143780.0,2023-05-26,"I recommend doing some research of them on your own time, learning about Wagner pmc gives some very good insight into the mess that is Russian foreign policy and propaganda, as well as internal affairs. PMC's (Private Military Contractors) are banned in Russia, yet Wagner openly advertises as such. This obviously implies that their status as mercenaries is sponsored by the state, and their leader, an oligarch named Yevgeny Prigozhin, has close ties to Putin himself (he's enriched himself through catering food to events for the state). This monopoly allows for what is essentially a parallel military force that Russia can use abroad for purposes of plausible deniability. Wagner was involved in the 2014 invasion of Ukraine and has been actively supporting and offering security services across the globe, most notably in Africa and Syria as mercenaries for authoritarian regimes. Unsurprisingly, torture and brutality are key Wagner tools. What really makes espousing Wagner specifically interesting (and deplorable, of course) is their involvement in the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and their usage as assault units in key battles of the Donbass. Prigozhin is an open critic of the Russian ministry of defense, is actively driving a wedge between military branches, realistically denies Russian state propaganda from the view of the battlefield, and has inserted his own style of propaganda in place of it. With all of that context, it should be obvious why wearing a Wagner shirt is grounds for instant dismissal from any western company. The average Russian may support the war from the lens of not wanting to be involved in politics or by being sucked into the cult of personality surrounding Putin. The average Wagner supporter understands Russia's existence as a Kleptocracy and mafia state and still cheers on their murderers. It's somewhat comparable to the high level of white nationalists that exist in militrary/policing positions in America, except packaged and funded on an exponentially larger scale and exported to neighboring countries in the form of death.",0.129,0.791,0.08,-0.9666,60

It is only more infuriating when they have no intention to learn and become better. It is called 'competitive matchmaking' for a reason. If you want to just play casually, then do just about that and enjoy the deathmatches and casual gamemodes, or wargames, surf, retakes and soo on.

1686775737.0,2023-06-14,"Yes, those 2 options are really the only viable alternatives, either option could have their downsides, and either option could have their upsides. It's a complex issue, and I think the easiest way to find out what works best is by testing it out in actual play/practice, and essentially ""seeing how the games feel"" with each style. But since none of us really have the power to do that, all we can do is theorize/type about it. Pre-picking spawns might be highly inconvenient. If it's on a roundly basis, it would surely get annoying, especially if the 15 second freezetime is wished to be not changed (less waiting, more playing). If it's on a halfly basis, it might inhibit a player's desire to switch up their play by having a better ""lean"" towards the other side of the map during the half. If it's on a halfly basis but you can start a vote (like a timeout/kick vote) to pick new spawns for the next round, that might be a pretty good solution but would definitely take quite a bit of getting used to. I personally think a zone block, just a box basically, around the respective buy zones is the easiest and most convenient solution. Luckily, this in theory should only be a simple, large, singular box per side, unlike Valorant's 12-walls-scattered-across-the-map per side. Now, in theory, players can hug the barrier if they desire the best possible routing to their destination. The argued downside to this is that rounds will play out the same, but that's not possible in a competitive environment where one team is attempting to outplay another, essentially ""forcing"" one team to do something ""better"" than the other team (in other words, different) on a roundly basis, regardless of whether or not the spawns are chosen by the players, or not chosen by the players. In other words, the spawns don't matter-- the plays of the players do. I like to think of it as painting on a new, blank, and smooth canvas, versus painting on a old, used, uneven canvas-- you can paint on both just fine, but one environment expresses a far clearer picture of the choices made by the person than the other does. Unfortunately we probably won't be able to get either of these ideas into the actual game to test it out for ourselves. However, it is possible to just play out some scenarios in your head. For example, de\_inferno is an amazingly simple map, and you can very easily envision s1mple hugging against the barrier at CT spawn to get the best timing possible for the aggressive car peek. The barrier drops, he runs and runs, he throws a flash that pops behind trump wall, electronic throws a flash from CT to ensure the enemies are blind, s1mple peeks the gap at the car position, he's blinded by the ""window flash"" thrown by an enemy T (thrown from the T stairs below house), the rest of the T's rush him down with galil's and mac-10's, s1mple dies with 0 value netted, electronic attempts to smoke the chokepoint, the T's perform a ""godflash"" as well as under-handing a flash into electronic's chokepoint smoke, electronic fails to avoid either of these flashbangs, the T's successfully smoke CT off through electronic's chokepoint smoke, they jump through, electronic attempts to net as much value as he can whilst blind, lands 1 bullet (23 damage), and is killed by the 4 terrorists leaping at him. The T's plant the bomb and win the afterplant scenario, using s1mple's awp at newbox, using electronic's AK at emo. The next round, s1mple hugs the barrier towards B once again. After 15 seconds, the barrier drops, he runs and runs, this time he throws a molotov close trump as well as an HE to prevent the mac-10 rush from being successful once again, he sees a molotov from the T's fly towards car to prevent his peek, electronic throws a flash from CT, s1mple peeks car whilst in the flames, sees nothing, and has to exit the position. Perhaps the terrorists are tucked into log or broom. The round goes into ""mid-round"" and ""late-round"". Nothing really happened in the ""early-round"". The next round, s1mple hugs the barrier towards A this time. He peeks mid, and is awped by dev1ce from the T ramp. The reason I played these scenarios out word-for-word is because I want to prove that despite the players having full control of what timing they want and which round they want to have that timing, it's actually the relationship between the two competing teams that's the focus of the game, not the relationship between the spawns that the two competing teams start with. Essentially, there is really no argument in good support of random spawns being incorporated into the game besides ""I'm used to it"", ""We've been playing with them for decades"", ""It's not that big of a deal"", and ""It makes the game more random"". It's not a good thing for the game to be more random based on a non-player-controlled factor. It is a good thing for the game to be more random based on player-controlled factors. Flashes, pushes, and aim. Even in a 1v1 community server, you can get the same spawns on the same map over and over again, but oftentimes you will see the strongest aimer remaining in ""Arena 1"" whilst the weaker aimers often remaining in the lower arenas. Despite the situation being identical every single time, what one would assume to be a ""stale game"" actually gives the perfect, consistent environment for the best to become the best, and stay the best. Once again, very similar to how the clean canvas paints a clearer picture of the painter's painting ability than a dirty canvas does. In my opinion, a possible reason as to why tier 1, extremely competitive, extremely evenly matched in skill tournaments seem to always have a different winner, might be because in such a high-heat, sensitive environment like a tier 1 match, a different spawn can absolutely turn the round for the extreme better or the extreme worse of a team. Because broky got this A main spawn to kill the CT crossing conn, rather than rain, Faze easily achieved this 5v4 situation with the help of this game-decided spawn, and from that point they made no mistakes in the round and were almost guaranteed to win it the moment broky got this kill. Had that CT crossing conn been able to have a better spawn for that specific play (crossing conn) broky wouldn't have killed him just based off of spawns, and something else would have to happen in the round if Faze wanted to win. In essence, it becomes a game reliant on Faze's flashes, smokes, mollies, HE's, pushes, timings, trades, and aim. Not a game reliant on Faze crossing their fingers that broky (who's always feeling it, like most tier 1 awpers) gets an A main spawn on this key, tide-shifting round. Outsiders won the Brazil major, Heroic won Blast Fall, G2 won Blast World, Vitality won the Paris major, Faze won the grand slam. Liquid isn't on the list, nor Cloud9, nor Navi, nor GamerLegion, nor Apeks. Did the winners win purely due to their skills as individuals and as teams, or is this due to their skills as individuals and as teams and random chance? Or, did they win due to their skills as individuals and as teams \*in spite\* of random chance influencing their games? And if that last question is indeed the case, why should we accept this random obstacle? Should the game be about expressing your skill in defeating your enemy with better aim, communication, and knowledge, or should the game be about expressing your skill in working around an obstacle that technically provides no enhancement to the game from a strategic nor emotional perspective?",0.096,0.713,0.192,0.9994,1

When you expect a fight is possible you should be trying to use almost exclusively single direction movement with minimal diagonals. Peeking your corners with only A and D movement. This does two things. First, it makes it easier for you to counter strafe. It's one button and done. Going right? Slap that A key and fire. Left? Slap that D key. Second, the closer to 90^^o that you can get to the corner the faster it will make you from your enemy's point of view. The more you are ""running into an angle"" the slower your peek will be. It takes more distance to peek on a 30^^o path than a 90^^o path. (If this doesn't make sense I can try to do some magical paint art for ya) Finally, your options if you are caught in a diagonal are to again mirror the movement keys you are using. W+D = S+A This is hard, I'm GE and I can't do it well, so I go for option 2 which is to simply drop into a crouch shot.

For this I would recommend playing some ""quicker"" modes. Even in the best case for a comp you will get like 20-25 kills over the course of 30-40min. If you play something like deathmatch or community retakes you will be getting the same amount of kills in less than 10minutes. You could go even further with an aim map, but honestly I find these pretty boring you will probably have more fun fighting against real humans. The second thing is knowledge, even on a day where your aim is poop, knowing callouts, smokes, flashes e.t.c will put you in a position to still support your team. Bring up an image of the map radar with callouts on your phone or 2nd monitor and play a game and try to use as many callouts as possible. You will be surprised at how quick you memorise it, 2/3 games and you wont even need the picture anymore. You can also use the ping function which will tell you the name of the place you ping underneath the ping icon. Use a site like [csgonades](https://www.csgonades.com/) to learn some line-ups, [this guide](https://www.csgonades.com/blog/practice-config) will teach you the commands you can use to get an offline practise lobby. Though unlike the callouts these will be harder to memorise, so start small with 1 or 2 for your most played map and go from there. And dont forget that not all the best nades are thrown with perfect lineups ""eyeballing"" a smoke into a key chokepoint is also very useful, just try to use your nades more in general, one of the biggest pitfalls of new players is buying tons of nades and then just never throwing them.",0.037,0.796,0.167,0.9925,3

If we assume that you’re paying 5 dollars per case on average (including key), that’s $2000 worth of cases to (maybe) get a knife which will most likely be worth less than $500.

If this is bait, 1) you got me and 2) fuck you don't ever make a bait post about gambling addiction that shits serious and has ruined the lives of/killed so many people TL;DR nothing you can do about the losses, stop now, develop sustainable routine, potentially seek help if you on your own can't get through it, learn from this If you're on any gambling sites, delete your accounts and change your api key & trade link too (assuming they're CS gambling sites since you're not old enough to be on sportsbooks/casinos). For steam get rid of any saved cards and even consider freezing your card if you don't have expenses actively and live off ur parents (not required to pay rent, free meals, not pitching in on bills, etc). Even if you have the fantasy of getting that ""one in a million super rare collectors item"" you aren't even at the age where you should be utilizing cash out sites especially when most of their KYC states you need to be 18 or older. Basically it's a hassle for you to get your ""profits"" and that assuming you even wanted to cash it out. Remer, unless you see cold hard cash in your wallet/bank account, as long as the skin is in your inventory you haven't made money; you've simply invested or hold an item that can give you money. Assuming you're a student and have free time consider a part time job if your situation allows (and depending on the country you reside in). Save up some money and once you got some bank saved up buy a few skins youve been eyeing. Splurging in moderation is good. I advise against opening cases at the risk of you falling back into poor habits even if you have a source of ""stable income"". Once you're older and are able to bet on sports books, just fucking don't. Stay away from that shit if you already got hooked on opening cases that give you slim to none chance of an actually cool skin. If you must play online casinos/sport books SET DEPOSIT LIMITS. I have personally set myself limits that if I hit will not allow me to deposit anymore money (I have daily, weekly, and mothly deposits set). Trust me the amount of times I reach the monthly limit to still click deposit knowing I'll see the same red X and ""you can't deposit since you've reached your limit"" message is more than I can count on my hands. This is all coming from someone who had been addicted since the era of betting on lounge which just grew into both csgo and real life gambling problems as I became an adult and had stable income. Even gambling limits are not a long term solution it's just a safety measure to prevent damaging one's self even more. If you really have trouble staying away from gambling hoping for that dopamine rush from a crazy win or even near miss, just don't gamble at all. Period. I know I say I set gambling limits but even I'm aware I should ultimately quit and am still wrestling with this to this day. Ultimately as others mentioned calling a gambling hotline and seeking professional help to assist in fighting your addiction is always a good move. You may not want to tell your parents but ultimately it may be what allows you to get through this. Just know that you're taking a loss with this, you didn't win big perhaps, and you won't see that money that you put in ever again. BUT by stopping now, developing healthier habits and a more realistic perception of gambling and the odds, you can come out the otheraide way better and take this as a huge learning opportunity; especially considering how fucking young you are. Again this comes from a person who personally has an addictive personality that permeates everything about their daily life; from substances to gambling I have personal experience and still battle with this shit daily.",0.109,0.776,0.115,0.9128,1

1688366366.0,2023-07-03,"Hey man its a small step but a big one. Also don't think this is the end of the world or you can't ""fix"" this. You are literally still a couple years off from being an adult. It's good that you recognized this early rather than letting it spiral. I know it also may be tough but I do encourage you to speak openly with your parents or if therapy is an option, meeting with a therapist to talk about this stuff and eventually tackle looping your parents in if that's something that you feel is important. As I said above I've dealt with and still deal with a gambling issue. Often I'm ripping hundreds in minutes and it's a disgusting binge for a month or so until I either won enough to cash out and coast on the ""excess profit"" until it depleats in days or realize I'm down the hole so bad I need to stop before I can't pay rent or my account may go negative because I forgot about a bill that I put on auto pay. But even once I take even a 6month to as long as a year break the little brain worm just keeps getting me back in. I'm not saying don't have fun and that gambling is the root of all evil either. I'm just saying you need to know yourself and if you're like me and are susceptible to binging/irresponsible habits fueled by a short term ""feel good dopamine rush"", you gotta really set hard limits if/when you do partake. If you got enough for a key that's just been sitting for months in the steam wallet and you have a case lying around fuck it; open it if you're not gonna use that 2.80 USD elsewhere. But that's the limit; you open that one and you don't put more money in. Just wait till you've sold enough garbage drops to u box another. Shits gonna be hard and will take time. You might relapse but don't sink into a dark spot if that does happen. Learn from it and start back at square 1. If nothing else, always remember that your life is worth infinitely more than the money you've lost. You've got a literal lifetime ahead of you and eventually you'll look back healthier and remember when you thought your life was over at 16 for losing potentially what you earn for a weeks pay.

After that, don't push on the enemy team, you jave to let them come and camp in site. Whereas on CT side, just being alive and you are already making it harder for the enemy team to win. Always give information about where the bomb carrier is/may be, and when you have killed the bomb carrier, call your teammates and stay near the bomb, as it will make it harder for the terrorists to win the rounds. There are some unwritten rules thst help you ein the matches : 1. Never rush when on CT side, only on hostage maps but be careful when rushing. 2. When bomb is planted, stay near the bomb and wait for the CT's to come in the site. 3. Communication is the key to winning, and also the chemestry between the team is very important. 4.

And decrease the account's chances of winning big on a case opening.

Easier and faster to start moving again. Crouching makes you sitting ducks and and easy target. And if someone was shooting your chest then now your head is there in that spot catching that bullet. Crouching IS useful but in specific situations, when you don't have to move from the position that fast, or when you're full auto/shooting longer burst, and instead of moving the mouse down you crouch to make the crosshair go lower etc. But it's not like you have to crouch for every shot or for every stop.

This website lists the price at 4,600 dollars. When I try to withdraw it, it tells me that it is temporarily unavailable in the stock of this website, therefore, the website offers me to exchange its price for other skins (like the ones I mentioned before). The only problem is that the page puts the values of several skins about 200 dollars more expensive, so that I do not end up taking advantage of the full 4600 dollars. Example: I checked and the price of the Karambit Gamma Doppler FN (Phase 1) is at $1,550. But this website puts it at $1,750. If I trade the Dragon Lore on this site for three stock skins that ""supposedly"" complete the $4,600, when I try to sell them on DMarket or BitSkins, I get a total of about $3,800. My question is which is more convenient, because I feel that it would be more profitable to take the Dragon Lore from this website and sell it for 4,500 and with those 4,500 buy other skins, than to exchange it and end up giving away 700 dollars.

(You may notice some keys on the market for sale however. These keys were bought before that update so they still can be sold or traded but they are treated more as a collectible then an actual key and they are a lot more expensive) Lastly if you have more keys then cases you can either sell some of your other things for wallet funds, trade for them, OR fandangle with the drops pool and hope the game drops the case.

1690676524.0,2023-07-30,"There are countless valid ways to improve, but as a faceit 8 that has been level 10 many times I can sum up the most important points for me like this: **Play deathmatch to improve aim, not practice maps** aim_botz is great for warming up, and playing deathmatch servers (especially some cracked community ones) can be tilting. But for actual improvement at csgo rather than just general fps aim is through DM. Predictable bot spawns on completely flat maps/one part of a map isn't comparable to playing against actual player movement on the real maps. **Learn fundamental utility for all maps you plan on playing** Don't get hung up on niche tricks you see in pro play. Just learn the fundamentals for every map you like. (Default smokes and flashbangs for common spots) Smokeboken is a great resource for this **Grind games.** Boring advice, I know, but this is the most important point. Grinding 10h of practice modes between each game might get you a rank up in fewer total games, but investing those 10 hours into actually playing will most likely make you a better player at the end of the day. Gamesense, map knowledge and crosshair-placement is extremely important, and can't be learned through aim training. **If you want some immediate advice** unbind your crouch key during aim practice (crouching isn't always bad nessecarily, but this is excessive, and detremental to your ability to move between shots) Learn to counter strafe better. Dont shoot while moving is basically rule #1 of csgo, but when you AREN'T shooting you should basically always be moving unless holding and angle. Get good at transitioning between moving and shooting basically. Do some fundamental aim training. This point is pretty self explanatory, and it looks like you're already doing this, but please dont hyperfixate on it.

My reality is this, that I could have a full lobby when I don’t want to play minimum 2-3 games per day, so I’d rather play with a mate - so we’re most of the time duo queuing. Firstly I agree deeply that Valve please fixes the god damn cheating issue. Can’t it just be a strict ban if you use 3rd party software that impacts the game files? I know that people create configs and stuff but why not putting it inside the game then? I want a 1st party platform, that gives me a save feeling, not a feeling that I start to doubt when there are funny shots or accounts which are strange. You cannot filter out Smurfs on steam, what you can do and that would include the next point „no mic and English“ is to reward people and therefore hence „guide“ people into certain Ingame behaviours.

I'm not talking about movement, crosshair placement, map knowledge etc. If you played a lot of casual games you should have them to some degree and they will improve by practice. First three sounds simple enough, but they are easy to learn and hard to master kind of thing. You should always be looking to adapting to your teammates, especially if you are playing solo. Communication is key like others have pointed out, but it does not end there. Always watch your teammates on radar and kill feed and get a sense of their style. If they are aggressive support and trade for them. If they are passive ask for their support and play entry. If something they are doing is not working try to direct them to another approach. For example if somebody keeps peeking long in D2 you should be flashing for them and preparing for a trade before they enter long doors. If they keep going alone it helps no one, and if they are not changing you adapt to it. If somebody does not know how to play B site in inferno, don't try the classical defense. Just molly to stop rush and then smoke. Maybe it's not optimal utility usage but it keeps your teammate alive. Fourth one is... well, self explanatory. You will run into a lot of dicks, people throwing games, cheaters and god knows what else. There is nothing you can do about it. When it happens, just go to your happy place, mute them, whatever you can do to keep yourself calm. Don't forget that every game is salvageable to a degree.

Reds and golds can be worth an insane amount of money, but are very hard to unbox, with golds being a 1 in 400 chance (0.25%). You're most likely going unbox blues. They are usually worth a few cents, so most of the time you have an 80% chance of losing 3 bucks. If you ever feel the want to open a case, open because it's fun.

Along with saying hello, and hoping you are well, I wanted to express my dissatisfaction with the accumulation of competitive suspensions (ironically, the 10 that I play the least, to say •never""). It happens that, for months now, I have been the victim of constant mass reports either for annoying behavior. as per anti-player competitive (cheating), when neither one nor the other is real but, in my opinion, they began to bear fruit due to the constant exposure of my public profile, as a player, coupled with the way I play. Actually, at a certain point, I don't care if I have this suspension or not, because I haven't played competitively in a long time and, if I did, maybe it's (for now) to play with friends, but what bothers me too much is the ""silence/mute"" that appears on my person when time to enter a game. I would not understand this in previous situations, where I used a program directly purchased and executed from steam. as 10 is • Soundpad'. with which he reproduced audios and others. Now, that was a long time ago, and today, after the suspension of more than a week, I entered to play some casual games of which, when leaving the first 3, I did not get any penalty (I never used the text or voice chat, or during the week, because I didn't play more than to see my items) but, when I finished the last one, where I was already listening some boos for ""cheating"" (according to them). I got not 7d 23h, but 10d 23h, which is already really derisory, assuming that I stopped play not to continue this unfair streak of absurd reports towards me, just because the inferiority of the people surpasses them and they think that one is cheating necessarily when surpassing them in ""skill""... tell me, how pitiful must be the life of such a person, for Cry over a video game. anyway. My question is, oodrian delete that history? Because it is really impossible for me to sustain this regret, and people will continue to believe, if I continue playing muted, that I am a cheater, without thinking about it, just for appearing ""blocked"", and that incites more doubts and more reports, for which the circle never ends and, what's more.„ it increases more and more (I would dare to say exponentially, but I have not seen such a number of people). You can calmly review my account, you will not find anything, as well as the processes and files executed on my computer (if necessary) so they can have a foundation in taking this streak away from me. Really, I am not criticizing anything from Valve, regarding CS:GO, but this is the last straw.„ Because it does not work based on tests or records, but based on of the amount, that is, if I hire a ""BOT"", or something automated, that reports the person just for playing, he would suffer the same effect?

If you save one case then you can buy the key using your steam wallet and gamble. It's possible Another way is just buying a gift card and it's super easy to gamble that. A third way I've seen is someone refunding a game they bought and then using that money in their steam wallet to gamble.

Basically they differ simply because they have some small features that are different between the games. I think this can be said also for the comparison between tloz botw and genshin impact. Genshin has the same core mechanic as botw, but then built itself in a completely different direction, making it a game that isn't known as ""Zelda copycat"". It's the same thing between valorant and csgo imo. Valorant took the base csgo and basically reworked it making some differences that make it feel like a completely new experience. In my personal experience, csgo feels like it's more centered around the single players, as everyone can use any gear, obviously it has team play in it, but I think it's less about what everyone can do. But I feel like valorant is more focused on the team than on the single, and that is because of the agents. It's a game where even the worst players can still be useful because of the abilities, it's a game where if you monkey pick 5 same role agents you're gonna have a hard time against a well chosen team, it's a game where losing even a single teammate can be a massive loss (something I feel isn't AS important in csgo). All in all, you don't hear people talking much about valorant's gun gameplay, but more about it's agents, as they are what really makes valorant as a ""csgo competitor"" instead of ""just a bad copy"".

Leetify Pro is great and I believe once you sign up for it they will generate a ton of clips for you using Allstar so it is a good way to get a bunch of highlights quickly.",0.025,0.831,0.144,0.9727,1

Knowing what to do vs having it in your muscle memory is a game changer. Dont get too discouraged when people are toxic literally just more time = better. Watch a lot of videos so you can at least have a guide on a path. Its alright to look at other peoples settings and copying it but at the end of the day its how comfy you are with the settings. The top pros setting doesnt mean that you have to have the exact same settings to be good. Also for the love of god get a mic. Its a team game where communication is key and just like other team events or sports, if you cannot communicate you already adding disadvantage to you and your team.

I did Aimbotz eveyday after i ate breakfast and told myself im not playing a match until i have done 1500 headshots, it may sound much and you will feel like giving up after 500 but just keep going. Do as many you can until your hand/wrist starts hurting, then you can stop take a break for 5 mins and you will be ready. Team? Find yourself a good team of friends to play with that supports you, the better they are the better you wll be. I started playing with globals when i was Mge, couple months later i was lightyears ahead of them. Ever heard about ""Dont surround yourself with chickens if you wanna learn how to fly"" ? Playing with and against people that are better than you makes you a better player, everything they do, just suck it all in. Watch replays and see what you did wrong the times you almost died or died. Look at how your friends play if they did something good. Playing with people that supports you and cheers you up when you save the round or when you do something good is the best feeling, and it will keep you motivated. And most importantly, have fun! Having fun and playing with good friends is key, eating good food and staying hydrated,put in the hours, all that and more comes into play.

1692485131.0,2023-08-19,Ahh cool. Sounds like your just chilling with friends now so all good. Having fun is always a good thing and depending on what region you were playing in back then GN2 was reasonably high as it was fucked everywhere except Europe. In Australia for example GNM-MG1 was the highest you could get without cheats. Literally multiple faceit 10 players I know were GNM. The rank system is still fucked but in a different way. YouTubers tell the community that playing for 1 win per day is key to ranking up but if you play less often you will get even more ELO for a win (points towards a rank up) but if you lose then you will lose more ELO than if you were playing daily. This is wrong. So so wrong! Since I have numerous accounts I've noticed that accounts that play occasionally rank up super easy. So I did a test starting at LE and I got Supreme with a 37.5% win rate over 3 months. 3 wins and 5 losses over 3 months. Then got 2 more wins over 2 months and got Global. So 5 wins and 5 losses over 5 months and easily got Global... I'm doing it now on my main account as this was on an account I don't care about and am ranking up every win. Losses don't even seem to matter at all if you play for 1 win a month. As far as I can see your losses matter less the less often you play. If you play once a week they will matter way less than if you play every day and your wins will matter more. And it just keeps increasing the less often you play out to one month.

Was Silver 4 or something back then(about 6 years ago), and there was a local event which was sorta like a dreamhack ripoff. Your everyday gaming event basically. Nothing special, but it had a LAN tournament so I thought why not. Joined a team of 4. They literally told me to fill and do nothing more, said they'd ""take care of it"". I thought sure, two were MG and one LEM so I'll just enjoy the cool ass setup there. 240Hz monitor and pro scene level gaming peripherals was a massive jump from my shit setup.

I kid you not, for a good half-hour or so my eyes and hands couldn't keep up with the new speed of information. But once I did, my team was surprised I kept up with them in the first match. They saw my rank was S4, so it's understandable they thought I'd struggle. By the end of second match, I was clearly at ease and did better than these guys mechanically. I couldn't do shit after the ""rookie matches"" because the 3rd match we played was a true 5 stack that were an actual team. Trading efficiently, flash assists, high-low angle peeking, util dumping, site execs... you name it, they had it. We lost, but I was far from sad about it. I was just happy and surprised that all the times I felt I was horrible any competitive game I touch, I now realised it wasn't just me, my setup unironically is to blame too. That was when I understood my setup matters. A LOT. Far more than some could ever imagine. Sure, practice in aimbotz and do various drills for a year, you'll be a lot fucking better than when you were playing casually.. but doesn't change the fact that even then your bad setup is holding you back from doing better.",0.113,0.738,0.148,0.8959,1

1692842388.0,2023-08-24,"> i really want some effective way to instantly stop theese anger issues Unfortunately not a thing, at least not universally. Things I can recommend to control tilt: * Don't force yourself to play. If after game one you are already tilted, take a break. If you want, you can come back later or in a few days. If you force yourself to keep requeueing, things are probably not going to go any better. Also if you only play every couple of days, you will just naturally get less tilted, but lets be real, thats not gonna happen ;D * Have something to drink ready (no need for it to be alcoholic obviously). A sip of water after horrendously fucking up a spray might be just the thing to cool the temper. * Have some chill music run in the background (Make sure you have a multimedia-pause/unpause button on mouse/keyboard). When the round starts, pause the music and when you die, you can resume it again. * Try to keep invested in your team by making callouts for your teammates after you die. Especially in lower ranks people don't tend to communicate, so you can take over that part for them. No backseating obviously, just comm the same things you'd comm if it was yourself playing. * If watching after you're dead doesn't work for you, maybe just have a youtube video open in the background that you can switch to if you die early. (Don't be the person that afks at the start of every round tho) * If frustration really gets to you, in the moment of pure tilt try just standing up and walking one room over for a few seconds. It sometimes help me to cool down a bit. * If you are frustrated with your teammates, you can rage at them all you want, just don't press that push-to-talk button. If you actually communicate your toxicity, things are probably just gonna spiral. Try to be nice. Being bad at the game isn't their fault, but toxic to them would be yours. The gambling is honestly the most worrying part to me. That you really do need to figure out. Throwing away money is not the way to deal with anger. When it comes to being toxic irl. For me after I got tilted by a game, I stop playing and go watch some youtube. After like 2-3 minutes I am usually chilling again. If its the same for you, then just do that and it shouldn't be too much of an issue. If the tilt from CS actually impacts you for hours after, then maybe you really should be playing less.",0.147,0.754,0.098,-0.9882,1

I agree that creating separate servers in Russia would be a great solution for players, as it would result in lower ping, the ability to communicate in the same language, etc. However, I do not fully agree with the main argument that is often presented here - 'all Russians are toxic, all Russians kick foreigners, all Russians constantly speak in Russian and they are just bad' (exaggerated). In over 1500 hours of gameplay, I have practically not encountered toxic players, and if I did, they were not only Russians. The key factor influencing this strongly is your trust factor. It's an obvious fact - the lower it is, the lower it will be for your teammates. Now, regarding the Russian language - essentially, every Russian learns English in school, and the positions on the map are often borrowed from the English language. That's why in my games, I only recognized that I was playing with Russians based on their accent or their Steam profiles. As for endless conversations - I often hear ENDLESS SILENCE in voice chat, which, in reality, is not much better. I understand that this comment is essentially useless, as it is unlikely to change your opinion, but I just wanted to share my point of view. Have a nice day :)",0.054,0.819,0.127,0.9411,1

First off, shoutout to the Valve logo for its secret hint! Who knew that the 'E' shrinking was actually a clue and not just a graphical design choice? Must be the same reason my coffee cup is smaller at the top – it's secretly pointing to the fact that I need more caffeine. 2. The Twitter handle u/e having secret clues to Valve? Oh yes, of course! It's just like my Uncle Bob having secret clues to the whereabouts of the lost city of Atlantis because he likes to fish. 3. The exact midpoint between LA and Valve is Button Mountain? That's some impeccable geography skills. But why stop at buttons? Surely, somewhere there's a 'Joystick Mountain' or 'Keyboard Canyon' we can factor in. 4. Converting 1,000 to binary and then reversing it? Genius! It's just like when I reverse my age in binary, I'm actually only 5... at least mentally. 5. The underscore character (\_) as a vital clue is truly mind-boggling. And here I was, all these years, thinking underscores were just a way for programmers to avoid using spaces in variable names. 6. The deep investigation into the number plate ending in 6. I mean, if that isn't proof, what is? And here I've been wasting my time looking at license plates trying to win at the license plate game during road trips. 7. Counting vehicles in de\_dust2? Brilliant! Though, I'm a bit surprised we didn't factor in the number of sand grains or how often players shout ""Rush B!"" 8. And finally, the impeccable logic that because tomorrow is the last Tuesday in August, it MUST be the release date for CS2. Of course! Just like how the last Friday of every month is when unicorns make their monthly appearance in my backyard. In conclusion, this theory is so brilliantly complex, it makes Da Vinci Code look like a children's book. So yes, let's get hyped for the TRUE CSTuesday. And if CS2 doesn’t release tomorrow, well... I guess it's just waiting for the appearance of Joystick Mountain. 🕹🏔",0.026,0.812,0.161,0.9949,1

I know that turks are considered similar to russians when considering their in game behaviour. The thing is, turks don't want to play with non-turkish speaking people as well. They don't want to have 70-80ping while the enemy team has 20-30. So having dedicated servers for the CIS region and another server for Turkey would benefit everyone.

1693513556.0,2023-08-31,"First of all, let’s get your sensitivity in a good spot. You know how in games with ADS you typically get more control (lower sens) once you ADS? Well, since there is mostly no ADS in this game you’re going to want to lower your hipfire sens down to a comfortable place, kinda like what you’d have while ADS’ing in other games. Maybe even a bit lower than what you’re used to. You don’t need high sens at all in this game as it’s a game of angles. You want to peek each angle in turn, always staying behind cover of some sort so you can’t be seen from the angles you aren’t fighting/haven’t cleared yet. This game will punish you very quickly if you’re out in the open. Remember that you won’t be very accurate unless you’re standing still. Crouching will make you more accurate, but you don’t want to use it all the time. Crouching should be a deliberate decision to gain accuracy long range or to move your head out of the way for certain fights. Your character has momentum in this game, so simply letting go of your movement key is not enough. You need to cancel your momentum by tapping the opposite direction you were just traveling. This will make you accurate pretty much immediately and is called “counter strafing.” The reason it’s called counter strafing is because almost all of your fights will happen using only the left and right (A and D) buttons. You want to get ready to fight and then step sideways (strafe) out of cover to start fighting. Don’t peek holding while holding W+A or W+D at the same time. This will make it harder to counterstrafe because you’ll need to press both the opposite movement key and S to cancel diagonal momentum, and it is better to peek out perpendicular to the enemy or else you’ll appear to move slower on their screen than if you only strafed into the fight. Accuracy is king here, so I wouldn’t recommend using LMG’s unless you’re trying to lay down suppressive fire while defending an area. You’ll want to play a lot of deathmatch to get your mechanics down, and prioritize learning the starting pistols (usp and Glock) and the main rifles (M4 and AK). Headshots do roughly 4 times the damage as body shots so this is why the lower sens is a good choice. Good luck! This is a tough game to get into so don’t get discouraged if you aren’t good for a while. It takes most people about 1000 hours just to get the basics down lol, and there’s a ton of people with 2000-3000 hours who are still quite bad at the game. <3",0.105,0.772,0.122,0.7121,1

1694191832.0,2023-09-08,"A problem or two I've found with this solution is that if you key bind select a grenade, it will pull out the secondary weapon when using the keybind to switch back to your weapons. If you add the same alias pattern to the manual keybind input select for the grenades, then in the case you do not have the grenade, it will switch your weapon, which doesn't follow the behavior of the cs go command. This would lead to pulling out the pistol in undesirable scenarios potentially. If you replace the ""pistol"" call in the keybinds with ""bind ""KEY"" rifle"" then the select last will properly pull out the priority weapon (ie. Primary then secondary if you do not have a primary). the binds that call the pistol alias, you won't swap weapons and it will rebind the priority to your primary weapon. If you use individual bind for every grenade, create an alias for it just like I did, The reason for the alias is I always want to switch back first to the primary, if you don't create an alias, it might switch to secondary, depends on what was used last Tl;dr Change pistol alias call to bind ""KEY"" rifle. Also you should bind your grenade keys to follow the pattern for the other slot selections as well. E.g //Weapons Switch (invnextgun) alias rifle ""slot2;slot1;bind ""KEY"" pistol"" alias pistol ""slot1;slot2;bind ""KEY"" rifle"" alias knife ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot3"" alias grenade ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot4"" alias C4 ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot5; alias he_grenade ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot6"" alias flash ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot7"" alias smoke ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot8"" alias decoy ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot9"" alias incendiary ""bind ""KEY"" rifle;slot10"" alias zeus ""bind ""KEY rifle;slot9"" bind ""1"" ""rifle"" bind ""2"" ""pistol"" bind ""3"" ""knife"" bind ""4"" ""grenade"" bind ""5"" ""C4"" (Bind the appropriate aliases to desired key inputs here E.g bind mouse4 he_grenade bind mouse5 flash etc...) bind ""KEY"" ""rifle""",0.061,0.894,0.045,-0.7488,1

Just run parallel to a wall and spray at it with an AK. You can immediately see how any movement will cause high inaccuracy. However stopping to shoot takes a while. If you just let go of the movement key, you still have some momentum in its direction. This is where you can ""counter-strafe"" to stop faster. Instead of just letting go the movement key, lets say ""a"", you can quickly tap the opposite movement key ""d"". This immediately cancels the remaining momentum and makes your shots accurate. It is a hard skill to learn, but essential to becoming good at the game. Also sometimes you just get scammed by the game and shots just don't hit because they don't feel like it.

The only question is if there's a drive to do it, from the cheat makers perspective, which there is, there's an insane economy there, check some of the bigger public cheats member count.. Face it AC still gets bypassed, ESEAs AC still got bypassed, Valorants AC still gets bypassed, LAN tourneys can still end up with cheaters. Yes you can delay the inevitable, but all you're really doing is closing the gap of who 'can' cheat by making the cost to cheat go up based on the work the cheat dev does and how they decide to price it. Some examples: ESEA AC can be bypassed with spoofed PCI devices. FaceIT AC can be bypassed by spoofing a driver with your modified code. Valorant's AC actually is quite obscure in terms of bypassing, but there are cheats that run on a separate PC and stream the cheats to your main PC using a device you have to purchase and pay subscriptions for. ALL anticheats can be bypassed with a simple solution that's been on yt many times before shown here: https://youtu.be/ne9bmMX82iY?feature=shared Since you can just not run the software on your own PC, and it simply moves the mouse physically, you cannot tell. You'll cut down on the majority sure, while also running the risk of losing the players that don't like invasive software, all the while, the cheaters still remain. The more viable solution that VALVe is likely taking: Let the cheater run rampant, collect signatures and modified game data over time, create an AI to try to counter this actively in game. They're likely letting the cheaters run rampant in open beta to allow their VAC Live learn from what's possible under the new engine, as that data hadn't yet been received before in terms of CS. Final note: Invasive software is just that, invasive. I would rather not get banned mid game by using obscure software compared to mainstream derivatives that doesn't actually cheat in the game, but gets me banned because it's that unknown and may hook into the game, e.g. overlays, debugging software, or otherwise, software meant for other games that do not actively affect CS. Nor would I rather have it actively scanning background processes, taking keystrokes for modifier keys on cheats, seeing what files get written/saved to during gameplay, or various other caveats that come with an invasive AC. These while individually can work to do what they want without harming users, is still a very frowned upon process, simply because it gives them more access to user data and insight on user's actions during gameplay, which may otherwise not be necessary to collect whatsoever, all so little billy can just spend another 3$ on a cracked CSGO account, and just do it all over again, because even HWID bans are redundant with how easy they can be to spoof or bypass.",0.11,0.81,0.08,-0.9468,1

I'm sure a 100hz CRT gets the job done. Higher refresh rate is generally better but as I understand it there are diminishing returns the higher you go. I noticed a significant difference going from a 75hz monitor to 240hz, but the improvement was probably also to do with the fact it was a newer, better quality panel. Definitely get a good mouse, don't need to go nuts but get something that feels comfortable with adjustable DPI. Mousepad is largely down to personal preference but it does help. A lot of people like the Steelpad QcK, it's inexpensive and gets the job done. Keyboard is less important but also helps. I've used some form of MX518 for as long as I've been playing CS.

It encourages spastic gameplay, more quick flicks and quick reactions needed. If I'm on B mirage all I need to watch is cat, apps, and market and there is PLENTY on site to hide from 2/3 or even ALL angles whenever I want so I can pick my fights as they come. If I'm on B Anubis then it's now B-main, B-con, street, and Palace that I need to watch and pretty much the only spot on that site where you can guarantee you wont have your back to an angle where someone could come is the upper platform on back site. One GOOD spot to hold site from. If I want to watch mirage B apps there is literally at least 3 different spots I can sit in cover from the other angles and watch apps. If I want to watch Anubis B main there is almost nowhere that is safe from B-con and literally nowhere on site will be safe from the back platform if they push mid. The way Anubis is DESIGNED is exactly why I don't want to play it unless I have a full que so I know I have teammates that will cover important angles. Having a mid presence in Anubis is honestly really key just for info and yet every premier match I've gotten NO-ONE will go there but me. And again you might say ""well this sounds like a problem with the players"" but maps like Dust 2 and Mirage literal brand new players will understand the importance of some mid control, the layout of Anubis is so counter-intuitive that players just seem to think mid control in it isn't very worthwhile despite it being QUITE powerful.",0.049,0.842,0.109,0.945,1

What I was trying get at was that the time to kill in this game is so low that aim alone will not save you, there's very little room for hesitation. Deathmatch with it now being Free for All only makes this even worse. You have to proactively position yourself so I you cannot be shot before you start shooting, that's not easy to learn in deathmatch, especially in CS2. The TTK is often lower than the network round trip time, if you can be shot and you have been shot, your client might not know until after you've already aimed and fired, you might not have missed, you were just already dead for the server and the person shooting you. Also, while, I do agree that you should wait before shooting, that's only if the enemy doesn't realize you are there or you think you can move away before you get shot, take that time to better assess the situation. But, IMO, the counting thing just isn't as effective with mouse & keyboard games, for IRL (airsoft, Nerf, firearms) and VR games where you have to deal with your hands and body physically not being able to stay still and everything having meaningful amounts of inertia, it works great, you know for sure that you aren't moving & the gun is still going to be pointed where you want it to be when it fires. Mice don't have that problem, they really don't meaningfully move when you aren't intending to move them.

Something around 800 edpi is good (DPI x sens), feel free to go lower or higher if you want but you generally want to move the camera view pivoting at the elbow and make small adjustments with your wrist. Think of how in COD your aim down sights sensitivity usually gets lower and easier to control than your hipfire. Since it’s mostly hipfire in CS you need you hipfire sens to be low or you’ll generally get outaimed. Stick to you sensitivity unless you have a good reason to change it. You will get used to it if you stick it out. Headshots are what you want to try for, so keep that crosshair high up at head height at all times. You need to get your mechanics in a good place so educate yourself on peeking and preaiming (search on YouTube). You MUST counter strafe every time you move. You will not be accurate unless your cancel your momentum by tapping the opposite key to stop. Do not ever peek while holding W. Literally always engage in fights with just A and D, never W+D or W+A. It’s too hard to counter strafe that way. Google counter strafing if you’re confused. Then I’d play deathmatch every single day, at least one game. I’d pick ONE map and only play that map, learning smokes for important areas. You’ll know what areas are important because you die from them a lot. Then I’d just play at least 2 games a day and grind it out. Don’t be afraid to die or make mistakes. Allow yourself to make mistakes and always figure out why what you did didn’t work.

I would advise against gambling or opening cases (if you get cases through a drop, you still have to buy the keys for them which is massively more expensive than the price of the average drop you will get). Browse the market and you will find nice skins for cheap. The skins also have a ""wear quality"", meaning on most skins there will be some wear and tear based on the wear quality. This has an effect on prices as well. In most cases higher quality will be more expensive. Field tested quality is a good middle ground (for me) where most skins are still enjoyable but not so much more expensive like factory new ones. So yes you can get stuff for free. But 99% of times it's ugly skins that are worth 0.03 dollars on the market (the minimum amount)",0.061,0.776,0.163,0.9748,1

1697727734.0,2023-10-19,"Okay, lets talk about m_rawinput, which was a CSGO command to disable any WINDOWS mouse settings (such as Enhance Pointer Precision, which is mouse acceleration). In theory, you do not need that command as if you do it right in windows & your mouse settings, there should be no mouse acceleration. To disable mouse acceleration in windows: 1. Open the Windows Start menu and type “Mouse Settings” in the search bar. Click on “Mouse Settings” from the search results. 2. In the Mouse Settings window, locate and click on “Additional mouse options” on the right side. This will open the Mouse Properties window. 3. In the Mouse Properties window, go to the “Pointer Options” tab at the top. 4. Under the “Pointer Options” tab, you will see a section called “Motion.” Within this section, there should be an option called “Enhance pointer precision.” This is Windows’ mouse acceleration feature. Uncheck this option to disable mouse acceleration. 5. Click the “Apply” button at the bottom of the window to save your changes, and then click “OK” to close the Mouse Properties window. Regarding fps cap: Do not limit fps less than refresh rate, it will cause screen tear, I have seen cases where framerate was locked 1 fps less than refresh rate and it caused tear, CS was unplayable to me (143fps & 144hz on samsung monitor) Guideline a lot of people use is: max fps = 2x of ur hz, so if u use 240Hz, cap ur fps at 480, if you’re not close to 480 fps, limit it to your monitors refresh rate, it is supposed to be better - did not test it, just read about it from people that did test it. I saw people using 240Hz monitors at 288FPS & 144Hz, because their avg fps is less than 240 or around 240. Myself I use fps cap of 300 FPS in CS2 because my avg fps is around 300 when it’s uncapped and I’m using 144Hz. Oh, more fps also means less input lag, think about this too, if you want less input lag but “unsmooth” performance or a little bit more input lag and smooth performance. My personal opinion about this: find what suits YOU and stick to it. Regarding game feeling off: It’s just subtick, I assume. Idk if it was placebo or not, but when I used aliases for movement to de-subtick WASD, walk, crouch and jump, it felt more consistent to me, now that they took it away, it feels weird again. Again, I do not know if it’s placebo or not - did not test it just played pugs with it. Regarding polling rate: Set it to 1000hz, there is no benefit of using 500hz polling rate, we’re living in 2023… 1000hz = 1ms 500hz = 2ms. The higher polling rate provides more frequent updates from the mouse to the computer, resulting in smoother and more precise cursor or crosshair movement. Key points: 1. Avoid limiting your FPS below your monitor’s refresh rate to prevent screen tearing. 2. Many gamers use the guideline of capping FPS at 2x the refresh rate, which can help reduce screen tearing and improve the gaming experience. 3. Some individuals may use lower refresh rates than their monitor’s maximum if their system’s average FPS is close to or slightly lower than the monitor’s native refresh rate to balance performance and smoothness. 4. Customizing your FPS cap based on your system’s capabilities and personal preferences is a good approach. 5. It’s essential to consider the trade-off between input lag and smoothness. Higher FPS generally results in lower input lag, but the trade-off might be less smooth performance. Oh, tell your friend to up his sens, if he cant do a 180° turn his sens is too low. Im using 400 dpi at 1000hz, 1.4sens ingame no accel and i can barely do 180° turn with one swipe - thats a rule I use when setting sens: one swipe = 180° turn, but again this is totally personal preference, there is no one-size-fits-all when we get to sensitivity it’s a matter of personal preference and playstyle. This is the same tip I gave to a friend when he used to play at 500 dpi and 0.4 sens, he was inconsistent. He upped his sens to 0.9 now he is consistent more than ever! (He needed like 5 swipes to do a 180° which is crazy, imagine having to lift your mouse 5 times to get the cursor where you want it to be) Other stuff he could be doing is analysing his own demos and looking at his lowlights, why he died, how he died, what could’ve he done to not die in that situation etc.. Again, this is purely stuff I figured out through the years of gaming and watching videos and reading online guides, it might not be accurate to a T. TL;DR: Dont cap ur fps lower than ur hz Disable maccel in windows Find your avg fps and cap it to your avg - feels better for me, but find your sweet spot and use it Polling rate @ 500Hz was used in the old days, because 1000Hz would lag for some people because pc specs were not that good, now that we have cpus that can handle that, 1000Hz should be better than 500Hz.

When you hit a movement key, you will have a different starting velocity every time based on your subtick time stamp. Since it’s so inconsistent, trying to jiggle peak can and will result in you over peaking an angle. - peekers advantage is still a serious issue due to the lag interpolation overcompensating for the subtick system - sprays still don’t show where your bullets are actually going. Again this is likely due to subtick as your bullets are going where they’re time stamped instead of being based on where your crosshair is at the moment the bullet fires. - jumping is extremely inconsistent once again thanks to subticked movement. - flick shots for every single weapon often don’t even go where your crosshair is, and again this is due to the sub tick system causing your bullet to lag behind where your crosshair is. The game is mechanically broken and this is just stuff I notice and bothers me every time I play. This shouldn’t be happening in a game that wants to be taken seriously as an eSport.

1700008082.0,2023-11-15,"Im not an expert but you could watch some rounds on Twitch if pro teams play a tournament to see what happens. I rarely watch esports, let alone a whole game, but what Ive learned for example is the exact scenario in this video. If you (as T side) win the pistol round, especially without planting the bomb, buy all 5 aks and spend all your money, it will be a catastrophe if you lose that round. Because the CT side will have your weapons, a good amount of money and you're kinda fucked the 3rd and 4th round. So what do (almost every) pro teams do? They buy 4 galils and 1 ak for example. Or they go for mac10s or some kind of smgs. But NEVER 5 aks. It's just not worth it, because you should also be able to win that 2nd round with galils/smgs. So thats the explanation on this video. Rest of the rules which apply to us (as non pro players) is to communicate and actually agree on what to buy and what not. Like in this same example, what should the CT side do? Do they force with mp9s? Or are they gonna full eco? Thats a decision that has to be made together. Me and my friends often go for just a grenade and try to stack some nades together hoping to get some kills and a good eco. And if we, for example, play with 1-2 randoms, we try to involve them into our decision making. And IF it happens that 3 people want to eco after losing some rounds (or the pistol round) and 2 people decide not to listen and just buy, its better to buy too. Because (ill wrap up my story), if 3 people eco and 2 people buy, you're likely to lose the round. And the next round 3 people have money and the other 2 have to eco now. As a casual player who doesn't play cs all day, that is extremely hard. So long story short: Try to watch a full game or summary on Twitch if theres a tourney and try to understand why they make those decisions. And for casual players like you and me, communication is key. It sounds easy and logical, but communication is not just giving callouts but also discussing tactics and what you guys want to buy and what not. Hope this helps! P.S. just came up.

Most any mechanical keyboard from a gaming company like Logitech, Razer, steelseries will be fine. No matter the switch type (linear, tactile, clicky) they’ll be geared toward having very light force to activate. So it’s purely preference which switch to choose. Though most gamers will choose to go with linear switches as there is no “bump” or initial resistance when pushing down on a key That said, Some key points you’ll want to consider when purchasing a keyboard - I mentioned earlier that going over 150 is usually overkill or overpay. The exception to this rule (aside from customs) are keyboards that use a magnetic or optical key switch. Keyboards with this tech technically aren’t “mechanical” because they don’t rely on a physical contact to activate an input, and are theoretically faster. Very often, these boards also come with software that will allow you to change the activation point of the key switch so you don’t have to press all the way down to activate it. If you *really* wanted the competitive “advantage”, going with a keyboard with these kinds of switches is the way to go. But I would say, that this advantage isn’t the most significant with CS or for anyone outside of the top percent of players. - Hotswap. Hotswap is a keyboard feature that allows you to take out switches without needing to disassemble your board entirely. Making replacing any broken switch(es) simple.

However you will need to activate an API key to sell it on buff or csfloat and in the last couple of weeks there are plenty of users scammed or almost scammed with the API key in the range of at least 10, 20 people each day. skinport has very good results and you can create a private sale with 2% fees and also bitskins is pretty decent.

1701377158.0,2023-11-30,I'd argue skins are more liquid than many things I can hold or use. Many take advantage of the fact governments aren't taxing them. It's a way to quickly exchange items of value with people across the world. As shipping prices increase they offer a way to avoid that as well. Before skins I used to flip gift cards but those had so many more risks. Before the 7 day trade ban skins were extremely liquid and keys were even used for money laundering they were so liquid. They can be used as a currency to skirt gambling laws as well. They also give 'prestige' in a time when people care as much about their online image as they do their IRL selves. (Some people put far more time into their lives online even.) You could see these as designer clothes for people who aren't going out to bars but instead get most of their interaction through a screen. Using a CS skin now doesn't feel that different than overpaying for some brand name shirt to look nice at a bar back in college in my eyes. > a legitimate investment in something Even people who have made fairly poor investment choices have made profit in the CS market if they've been in for 3-5+ years. People who have been in longer or who made great investments have profited absurdly. I keep most of my money in traditional investments but these do offer a unique opportunity. I can't believe some of my things were 20x before CS2 launch and are still 10x even with the current poor market conditions.,0.069,0.811,0.121,0.9211,2

There are also dozens of blatent spinbotters/rage hackers still not banned that are on my blocklist still.

There are specific players. They can be bad regardless of the place they born in or the language they speak. On the other hand, there are excellent players from Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, etc. Stop with the hate. Hate begets hate. As for the language... I agree, there are players who can speak English and simply don't do so playing with English-speaking teammates. If they do it because of their ego, they are dicksuckers. But the situation is that most players don't know English or have no language practice. I have many friends who are simply afraid of being misunderstood, so they often don’t use mik at all.

Players see all the cheats and go, you know, what either they decide to cheat themselves or they just straight up quit because they can not trust the other team whether they are being honest or not. They have to do something, or the downturn of players will continue. Getting an AC that works should be the highest on their priority for this reason as cheaters are pushing player out of the game. So if they double down on broken VAC or get a kernel AC I don't care as long as it works and stops cheaters. They should have a development team entirely based around working on AC and security for the brand and games. If they have the team, then they should be canned and hiring people who know what they are doing. That way, it doesn't take time from the devs working on the game (bug fixes, content, and such) who probably don't know as much about the subject anyway. Valve has the money to do something, and if they don't invest it into security and AC, then I'm no longer going to invest in valve.

They have to do something, or the downturn of players will continue. Getting an AC that works should be the highest on their priority for this reason as cheaters are pushing player out of the game. So if they double down on broken VAC or get a kernel AC I don't care as long as it works and stops cheaters. They should have a development team entirely based around working on AC and security for the brand and games. If they have the team, then they should be canned and hiring people who know what they are doing. That way, it doesn't take time from the devs working on the game (bug fixes, content, and such) who probably don't know as much about the subject anyway. Valve has the money to do something, and if they don't invest it into security and AC, then I'm no longer going to invest in valve. If more players stepped up to boycott valve until they do something, I bet they would do something. I know I'm done until then. To the players that stick around, good luck, the more of us honest players that quit because of the issue the more often you will be playing against these dirtbag cheaters. Do I want the incompetence of valve to have a security risk on my pc, no,not really. Do I also want an AC that work, fucking right I do. I can't think of any other competitive online game that has this issue this bad. Get your shit together valve!",0.147,0.755,0.098,-0.9721,1

Ofc it doesnt only come from any one country, but the main source of opium here comes from poppy plants in the middle east, and the fentanyl is mainly supplied by a Chinese pharmaceutical. I was simply stating that the US doesn't produce many of the drugs it so recklessly abuses apart from weed, alcohol, and much of its meth, but the fact it's so widely available to be imported for decades if not centuries proves that they're not the only ones with such a problem. Not just opioids, bud. Coke comes from south America, psychedelics (at least the components) are imported along with many of our pharmaceuticals, even legally. You're kind proving my point. It comes from all around the world, which makes it a world problem not a US one. Yes, it is that and only that: a coincidence. Don't get all conspiracy theory on me. I don't need to hear whatever point you were trying to allude to there, but I can say it has no confirmable basis.

I'm friends with a kid like this. He's 16. Begs me for skins and cases (which I don't give him). His friend opened some gloves about a year ago and now he's basically a gambling addict. He does chores every week for money that he spends on cases. His PC is dying and crashes every game. His upgrade plan is opening some gloves or a knife rather than saving. He asks for electronic funds for birthday or Christmas from relatives so he can buy cases and keys. IMHO his parents should be aware at that age but either they don't care or are too busy but I'm sure there are plenty of 18+ people that really can't afford it but do it out of fomo too. Lots of people that gamble can't afford to. It's literally preying on their desperation (all gambling not just Valve). No one gives a fuck about an adult that has disposable income having some fun. People don't like kids and poor idiots being manipulated by psychology to spend what they really shouldn't. At least that's my take. Not that I'm a saint... I bought thousands of cases.

Though of course we all have the freedom to exchange skins as we like. It’s unfortunate that nfts are synonymous with BAYC because they’re much more than monkey pictures. The monkey picture is marketing and branding of the company Yuga Labs, the nft is merely the fact that they exist on the blockchain. On top of that, BAYC (to stick to the example) is CC0 which means the company has no copyright ownership. This would be one thing you can do with your monkey picture and it’s why you see shitty burger shacks or snoop dogg’s sketchers collab. Valve flipping a switch can happen “any” time however what’s more likely is that your personal account is banned or items are prevented from being accessed. They wouldn’t just add more rare items for free they make too much money off cases. CSGO to CS2 showed how reactionary the market is to change from valve. Certain skins are “ruined” because of updates despite them not being in a “final” state as indicated by valve. I even swapped some snow leopards for vice gloves near the end of beta when all vice’s looked FN. You point on renting items is right on target. Often with skin collectors they throw shade at valorant or other games where you just throw money at the developer. However CS is only a bit different but the money in the market gives no incentive to upset things. I use skins a lot to explain nfts in a gaming context. And to the last point they spend a lot of time looking at them because some of them don’t know how to play the game.
