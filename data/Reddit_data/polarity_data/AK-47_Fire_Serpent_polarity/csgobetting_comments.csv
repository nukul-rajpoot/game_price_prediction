1396741188,2014-04-05,"Thanks for the response! And I think I agree with your way of sizing bets - underdog bets with only small disparities do not merit betting a large % of my bankroll because the variance is too high. And I like your group categories, obviously I have my own opinions and would swap a couple around, but I it's a nice method for bet sizing and seeing if the odds are worth it. And talking about maximizing value, what I do is remove guns that are rising in price (or are undervalued) from my betting pool. For example, I have 8 AK Fire Serpents, 3 Glock Fades and 2 SG's blood in the water saved up. Although the risk of hoarding those weapons is they're subject to a market crash. Also, if I liquidize them for keys I end up with 20 items worth 2.7 instead of one big betting item. So while this strategy has earned me a lot of value, I'm hoping csgolounge will increase their values soon so I can profit from it. Also, I believe keeping a document with all your profits and loses is very important. I keep a simple google docs spreadsheet (basically an excel document) - here's a picture from my first two days since I started this spreadsheet http://i.imgur.com/LHjAYGd.png. The potential value column is unnecessary, but I write the potential value I had when I bet (which is subject to change) just in case I forget or am unable to check a more accurate one later. Also, before starting this I calculated my CSGO net worth using http://www.steamanalyst.com/ and some other website that basically did the same thing, and subtracting the value of the guns that I do not want to bet ever (the ones I use while playing). I find this extremely useful, as I clearly see all my wins/loses instead of trying to guesstimate them. Thanks again for the reply, it's nice to see other people that think so deeply about these aspects of betting. Apart from being useful, it's also really fun! E: You should keep that gun to yourself as you found it, but I would like to hear about how you find weapons that have disparities like that one. Was it through using the csgo companion value addon that sadly can't be used anymore, or are there any other methods you use?",0.072,0.713,0.215,0.9964,1

Minikerr doesn't have an AWP so far this half. There is a very concentrated apps push, anger is in pit, semphis and n0thing in b site. The team of three completely wrecks them with hiko rotating from A. 11-13 for coL. n0thing with 167 +- damage through smokes. Gares gets a kill with his AWP banana. I believe there was a team kill on Manajuma. 11-14 coL. MJ going for a force buy to avoid the tie point. They have one smoke. Bunches of people in apps for Manajuma. Anger gets 2 pit kills onto balcony. Semphis ends the round with a couple one bullet bursts. 11-15 coL. Semphis and shroud get picked early in the round. Col easily wins the round with only two deaths. COMPLEXITY win the first map 16-11. FIRST MAP ANALYSIS: coL looked as if this would be an easy map for Manajuma after getting dominated through the start of the first half. After losing the first half 4-11, coL had a GREAT CT half, not dropping a round. Shroud was not a big factor in this map. He didn't have any large clutches like the game in Nuke. In the second half it was very evident that not having an AWP on Minikerr had a profound affect on MJ's success. MAP 2: de_dust2 Pregame: Manajuma selected this map. I've seen coL play on this map and n0thing and semphis had a pretty decent crossfire set up in mid for CT. I can't really provide a deep analysis because I was really watching these maps while studying. (Note: Steel just agreed with my pro predictions about n0thing and semphis.) Game within the game to watch in this map: Hiko's Stattrak Fire Serpent vs Shroud's Stattrak Fire Serpent New casters: Dazed from IBP has replaced klops, joining the team of steel and cotton. KNIFE ROUND: lol nope pistol round! Knife round was missed on stream I guess. PISTOL ROUND?: coL starting on T side on de_dust 2. Jumas get the first two kills. 5v3 with the advantage for Manajuma. n0thing gets two kills to start the round after his team gets killed. Jumas pick up the pistol 1-0. Minikerr opted for an M4 as opposed to saving for an AWP. coL on upgraded pistols an armor. Semphis has a deagle, got wrecked. Bomb is planted. Two kills are had for coL. 2-0 for Manajuma. Sean Gares picked up a Scout. Strange buy, but he's a pro, and I'm writing about the match on reddit. Shroud chooses to save as coL plants b. 2-1 lead for MJ. My homie Jordan n0thing Gilbert just naded himself to open up the round for Manajuma. Hiko turned at the wrong second and got shot in the back. 3-1 for Manajuma leading into an eco for coL. Gares and Semphis bought AKs, so there wasn't a complete eco. Hiko grabbed a Deagle Blaze. Desi holding B site whack a mole style. 1v4 for Jordan. Gilbert does nothing much except for a frag. 4-1 MJ. Dboorn aced after prenades long, 5-1. Minikerr picks up an AWP for the first time of the half. Gun round lost for MJ. MJ has enough money to buy again next round. 14-12. Sean with two AWP kills up mid. Minikerr got tagged up at T spawn with his AWP, and he drops suicide and gets dropped by Sean. Desi seems to be saving T spawn, but he gets wrecked by Semphis. 14-13. Force buy for Manajuma. Sem hits Shroud from lower. Sean going to town with his AWP. (Steel and Dazed are going hard with the innuendos in stream. this is great for those not watching). Hiko gets two with an auto, and n0thing cleans it up. Tied 14-14. Another force buy for MJ. 4 nades total. Easy 3k for Semphis (maybe four). 14-15 lead for Complexity! Dboorn super lit by a nade (from 100 to 99 hp). 3v3 so far. 2v3 for Jumas. 1v3 advantage for MJ. n0thing tried his hardest, but he loses the round. 15-15 heading into overtime. OVERTIME: Wasn't really watching this round. First to four OT. MJ take the first round. 16-15 MJ. Shroud is showing up again. Planted in a 2v3. Hiko kills everyone, but it was a second too late. 17-15 MJ. Shroud only one left in a 1v4. Can't do anything. 17-16 switching sides in OT. Sean and minikerr choose to AWP with their full money. Hiko plants after n0thing gets taken down by shroud. Shroud takes down another. 4v1 against Hiko. Hiko gets AWPed, bomb defused. Match point for Jumas. 18-16. 4 AWPs and an auto between the two teams. Shroud left alive in a 4v1. 18-17. Last round of first OT. coL started with 4 AWPs this round, quickly switched to 2 aks 2 awps. Hiko grabbed another AWP, now back to an AK. Only 1 awp left for coL. Minikerr gets two awp frags mid. Players in game chat complaining about lag. Shroud holding A from ramp, nothing so far. Evened to a 2v2. Defuse on for Manajuma. 19-17 GG for MJ. ANALYSIS: Well that was a roller coaster ride... Anything is possible. T sides are going poorly for both teams. Knife round will be of utmost importance for third map nuke. MAP 3 de_nuke: PREGAME: This should be fun. CT on Nuke is important. Knife round is important. Everything is important. Cotton looks tired. Steel doesn't sound tired. Game within a game: Which did Hiko spend more money on? His countless Complexity stickers or his knife? Knife round turning up: Complexity wins the knife round, chooses to go to CT side on Nuke. STEEL AND DAZED ARE TALKING ABOUT SHARING LOADS. Pistol round: The innuendos by the IBP players are strong. Complexity won the pistol round only dropping two players. 0-1 coL Hiko spraying with the Famas from ramp to radio, gets an early 3k. Gets one more spraying. 4k from Hiko and 1 from Semphis against the eco. 0-2. Jumas force buy with low cash. Gares gets killed early. Roof strat from Jumas. Silo kill from Minikerr onto sem. n0thing had a great chance to get a 4k, messed it up. Lower push by Jumas. Hiko got taken down there. 1-2 lead for coL. Second plant in a row for Jumas. 2v2 retake. Sean gets two to take the defuse, BUT NO LESS THAN A SECOND. NO KIT. 2-2. 3 early kills for MJ. Third plant in a row. Jumas has 3 early rounds as T Nuke. 3-2 lead for MJ. Early trade out. MJ plants again. Gets the clutch from 3v4. 4-2. Jumas has won as many rounds so far as T ON NUKE as the first two maps combined AFAIK. coL on the eco. Couple of dinks from coL, still only 2 kills on the round. 2-5. Auto on Gares, Hiko has some clutch kills to end the round. coL gets a rebound win 3-5. Shroud kill through smoke................................................ I think that's enough. 3-6 lead for Manajuma. Nice crossfire from Gares and Hiko to get two coming out of radio. Desi saves, and we have 4-6 for MJ. n0thing had a nice double kill to keep coL in the round. MJ failed the boost onto the roof into heaven, 5-6 in favor of MJ. Hiko is tired because it's 2 AM eastern time. Jordan is on the west coast at least so it's only 11 there, but this has got to be rough for the east coast players. I know Hiko took a nap this morning after his stream. Times are from 11 PM to 2 AM at the earliest right now for the players in this match, so there is quite the possibility that a player falls asleep during a clutch. If you Europeans are watching for the clutch morning stream as it's 8 Central European Time, then hello. This match has been crazy. That's all. Match resumes. coL 5-6 MJ Anger gets a nice kill thru smoke in lower, couple kills in vents off camera for coL. 6-6. Gares took irukandji down outside dropping bomb outside. Quick win for coL. 7-6. 3 smokes for MJ, all have AKs. Irukandji just boosted two onto silo, high potential for super boost onto cat. A minute into the round not much hsa happened. Super boost didn't happen because desi fell off the silo and roof area. VERY sloppy round, probably because it's passed the bed time of most of the players left. Someone killed shroud in the smoke as he was planning. It was very nice. 8-6 for coL. Last round of first half between these two. Quick 2v4 advantage for Jumas. 1v4 now after a kill from dboorn. Anger last alive for col, killed coming up the ladder. 8-7 lead for coL. HALFTIME ANALYSIS: coL could have down better. Pistol round: Hiko last alive in a 1v2. Got wrecked. 8-8 all tied up. Anger got a plant through the smoke, that was good enough to get some money for col. 9-8 lead for MJ. AWP on Minikerr. The trades were on in this round. Jordan gets the last trade there. 9-9. Hiko chooses to take chunks out of squeaky. Gares has a p90, there's a swag on the CT side (minikerr). HIKO PICKS UP THE SWAG. Drops the swag. Shroud 3 hp at heaven, he managed not to die dropping down. SHROUD AND HIKO ARGUABLE BEST PLAYERS NA BOTH WHIFF FULL PRIMARY CLIPS AND SECONDARY CLIPS. That was great. coL won the round 10-9 lead for complexity. Eco is on for MJ. 1 P250 for Jumas. Flawless round for coL. 11-9 lead. Hiko loves shooting up squeaky. You guys remember when fnatic failed on the ladders of train? I was interested to see if that would happen heaven last round with shroud. It didn't. Double kill cam from irukandji in warehouse. n0thing got a plant off somehow, 1v2 lost by n0thing. Defuse by MJ. 11-10 coL. Low money on MJ, number of deaths made drops a necessity. Two famases, 1 ak, 2 m4s. Desi gets a 1v1 against Gilbert. 11-11 tied up. Eco for coL. MJ win the antieco. 11-12 lead for MJ. AWP on minikerr. Hiko in a 1v4 isn't able to do much. 11-13 lead for MJ. Anger eats an early nade down to 20 hp. Hiko gets the entry. Sick AWP shot from someone, bot seen on official stream. 3v2. all players low hp. n0thing gets two quick. 12-13 lead for MJ. Crucial round. This round decides eco for rest of game for both teams. Not much action 1:30 into the round. First kill is Gares in secret. coL looped ramp-&gt;heaven-&gt;upper-&gt;planted A. Great play after a slow start. coL is able to tie the game 13-13. Semi-eco for Manajuma, one saved rifle for MJ. No armor or nades for anyone except for dboorn who saved. n0thing got the entry kill heaven, semphis comes in and gets two. Gares catches desi in vents from secret. Shroud is last and gets killed by semphis for his third kill of the round. 14-13 lead for col. Gun round for both teams. Limited nades for Jumas. Push outside for three members of complexity. Desi opens the round in secret, gets another. Has a teammate in secret. Another kill for desi through a gap in a smoke. Hiko and Anger left against 5 from Jumas. Hiko dropps. 1v5. Nothing there. Flawless round for Jumas. 14-14 tie ballgame. Buy round for both teams. Gares has an AWP. Hiko hates squeaky door. He tries to kill it everytime. Trades galore. Gares misses twice. 1v2 with Gares and dboorn and irukandji. Gares has missed three. Misses two no scopes. Manajumas takes the tie point. Gares didn't have room to miss those shots there. Full buy from both teams next round. 15-14 lead for MJ. Game point. Complexity just poured out of hut stupidly and got wrecked. Last kill was a nade to the face of anger. Could have easily been won by complexity. Final Analysis: I can't analyze anything right now. I am very tired. Complexity could have won dust 2 at multiple points during that game. I don't know how many characters left in this post. Very much a roller coaster of a game. Well, guys! That was quite the match. Coming from NA it was good to see these two teams being so close. Hiko disappeared in the last couple rounds it seemed, probably because it's almost 3 AM for his time. Manajuma vs IBP next week should be very interesting because of the new blood of MJ and the experience of IBP. I really can't possibly have anything else to say, but I did bet on complexity. It seemed as though they could have had that one. Hopefully some confidence was brought back to them from this match. I just realized this match took over three hours...",0.148,0.738,0.114,-0.9989,34

The Underdog bets are usually trash skins thrown on them. only some are priced good enough for returns to the winners. so its Natural they will not split and skin in half to give winnings to a guy who had 35 value returns and instead got skin worth 45+ ( asiimov, fire serpent etc.). This creates and value deficit so low value winnings are not given. My Best Guess how it works. I all innned on both matches and got overpaid by like 60 Value. tl;dr : Bet big on 80%+ matches or do not, since most of the times if winnings are less than 1 then they will not be given.",0.061,0.744,0.195,0.9795,1

My heart goes out to you friend, because you are a witty, intelligent, and humorous person who doesn't deserve this string of bad luck. I could kind of see it coming when you lost that Vexx/Mythic game due to DDos. I'd never seen you in the comments sections after a loss and I'd also never seen you as mad as you seemed to be. Believe me, I have lost over $120 in the last two days and have mostly bet on all the teams you did. I don't know what it's like to lose as many in a row as you, but let me tell you a story real quick... A few days ago, a friend of mine was down on his luck in betting. He's my friend in life and I see him almost daily. I advised him on a game: 3DMAX vs ClutchiT. He had said that he was tired of losing all his bets (he lost BIG at ESEA). He is a notorious underdog bettor and he bet all underdogs, and lost, before the big VP v. Fnatic game could come around to save him. Long story short, I told him to bet one of his max bet items on 3DMAX and to use those winnings to place on XGB vs whoever they played (XGB was the underdog). Instead of just using my advice, he decides to bet the rest of his skins (AWP Asimobv FT, Fire Serpent, and a Deagle Blaze) on 3DMAX. He messages me right before he goes to bed that he was so tempted to switch it to ClutchiT.... I tell him I think it was a bad idea to bet so much, but that I think he bet on the winning team. Well..... he lost. I felt like shit (I lost too). It quite literally affected our friendship and I've decided that I'll never advise anyone else I know in real life on who to bet on. Now it's been three or four days since we talked, and the one time I saw him, he was drunk and not looking too great. Since then I've been losing like crazy and now I read your story and it's getting too real. I really, truly wish you the absolute best in everything you do because you've shown me time and time again that your character is worthy of having good things happen to you. Although this ends your time commenting here, I hope that you read any of the comments I make and know that you were an integral part of making my experience on this sub fun.

Take me for examples, i used to lose bets on 5 games in a row with score 16-14 , i could not believe it, then i raged bet without even care about researchs, i won ! But i know i will not be always lucky like that.... And yes, there is still some golden rules about bettings : if you bet to get real money to spend, frequently cash out is a very good way to make your unexpected loss not a big deal. I have made total more than 2,5k EUR, but every time i reached 700-800 EUR in value, i cashed out 300-400. Thats why when i lost a lot of crazy matches, i still felt happy since i already have 1200 EUR in cash to use in real life. And if you bet to have a chance to upgrade your invent, do it as soon as you have chance, and remember to move all betting skins to 2nd acc which is purely for betting. On my acc for playing, i have all the things i need : a crimson web knife, fire serpent, asiimov, etc....whenever i lose a big bet, i look at that acc and smile : "" at least, i have stuffs ppl are trying to have "" Those are just some simple ways to make you feel better.....and less rage-bet with thinking "" i will go big, go big or go home !

1424122242,2015-02-16,"""everything from their rank, their past few matches, who they've beaten, their individual player makeup, etc. seemed in their favor."" If you look at recent games you'll find that maybe a team has beaten a particular team several times. You may find a team has beaten another better team several times. With the top teams that are appearing in this tourney it doesnt matter all that much. Teams are constantly evolving, it is unwise merely to see that a team may have been better/got lucky over another team in the past. In order to properly consider the teams you must see in what position they are NOW. This is through seeing whether a team has been practicing alot recently(bootcamping), whether they have a dedicated awp and his skill level, whether they have a specialised IGL. With top teams it is possible for them just to prevail aim-wise , since all of them are so skilled they are able just to take crucial rounds and steamroll but generally some may have factors that will make them more of a favorable bet than the other team. NiP, has a dedicated awper who is going to try hard to make it into the team. He is more consistent than Lele and is less aggressive, this is what they need to get the long picks and advance onto site. the rest of the rifling crew is on par with envyus. envy does not have a dedicated awper and ive seen that completely screw them over sometimes. ""Furthermore, to those of you who bet on NiP for reasons outside of your ""gut feeling"" or beause you're a fan of them—what type of data compelled you to take this risk?"" Funnily enough, in my experience in betting, I have found that gut feeling is the only way to go about properly betting. Its through seeing all the angles of the 'team dynamic' that you are able to pick the right bet...theres no way to calculate it, there are too many variables..eg. one team has a dedicated awp the other doesn't. But the awper might not be KennyS it might be maikelele who only no-scopes - well then the impact of the awp is somewhat nullified. Hence it isnt so much about calculation but trying to gut feel your way to a decision. envy is actually my favorite team, i think Happy might be the most creative player in the world but in the end it doesnt matter if you have star players its about the overall team dynamic (what the team can bring to the table as a whole against the other team) and a bit of luck.

I started blind betting and doing good. Back in January and happened to put 10 bucks against nv vs clg at the xgames Lan... big win... pimped my inventory out and got hooked. Went through peaks and valleys until I tried for more dumb luck and started doing 10 bucks an underdog with worse than 25% and started getting killed. This is where I took $80 in random skins from 10-1 dollars. And started betting over dogs only and research simple things and staying current with the scene. Over the last month and a half i have methodically bet over dogs in terms of confidence. I've also rode fnatic's, nip's and tsm's coat tails at Lans. Cevo matches are my favorite over dog because of the split safety net. On those I go $40 on any other I look for what gosu and gonuts has to say and hltv on whatever maps. I've climbed out of the hole slowly but it feels good to be on a winning streak. I aim to make my target returns 7-10 bucks now from where I started I just wanted 2-5 bucks. Another thing that has been helpful is the na teams as of late... after the shake up I have one na prediction wrong (LG vs clg) and one eu game wrong (nip vs tsm in grand final). I never bet lower tier teams (balkan league) Finally and what is preached more than ever from people around here and it took me $300 to learn was skip skip skip skip skip... for example tsm vs fnatic tomorrow and navi vs nip tomorrow... both those games are traps and don't deserve a bet either way unless your feeling lucky or like winning recklessly (hitting on 17?). Learning to just skip and pick my spots (roughly 4 games a day) has been the biggest help in my betting. Tomorrow is going to be the first time I'm going to break this because I think the piter vs orbit game is lop sided (I think orbit is the favorite on raw skill) so I'm going to drop 10 on them and see if I can take an underdog. Vp tsm will get my attention if it stays 75/25 but besides that nip is getting my big bet and that will be it...",0.053,0.833,0.115,0.9814,1

There's simply no other skin with the volume that the FT Asiimov has, therefore your 4x 'almost max bet' with $57 FT Asiimov's probably had about the same potential of overpay as it did before. The really lucky people who had the true max bets during that time were almost guaranteed to get overpay. And let's be real here, nobody went out and sold all their Asiimov's for master pieces, FT Fire Serpents. and ST MW Blood on the Waters...

Even Enough people did during the last 1-2 weeks. I max bet a lot, and I just stopped completely because I rarely got overpay with FTs and I normally got shit items.

1431475868,2015-05-13,"Usually you don't get overpay when you bet on 50/50 games or anything under 80/20. The reason is because a bet of $240 on the 80% overdog yields a $48 return. So technically you can only get ""true"" overpay up to about 75% because that is exactly a $60 return. Of course there have been rare circumstances where people get overpayed by a few dollars on 60/40 games, but that is an exception that is so rare it's not worth counting on when you are calculating odds. Another form of overpay might be receiving an item worth waaaaay more than $60 when you get paid out.

1440451272,2015-08-24,"I do :) Trading up to skins has a negative Expected Value (EV) in the long run. If you calculate the total value of the skins you are trading up versus the value of the 1 skin you will receive in return, then you will (on average) get a negative % ROI (return on investment). There are ways to profit from the trade up contract, but it would only be done by taking a huge risk. At the lower ends of the spectrum (i.e. light blues, blues, and purples) the amount of skins you can receive varies greatly, which will also affect the ROI of your trade up. In case you weren't aware, trade up's have a formula that can be somewhat defined. Each skin you put in from a certain collection gives you a chance to receive the higher skin from that particular collection. So if you've got 10 blues from the 'Gods and Monsters' collection, then you are 100% guaranteed to get a pink from that same collection. And that pink can either be a M4A1-S Icarus Fell ($150ish) or a G3SG1 Chronos ($13ish). If you were to buy all the blues off the market individually, you would look for the best value for your money. In this case, both the UMP Minotaur's Labyrinth and MP9 Pandora's Box are around $10 each, which would put you at around $100 for 10 of them. At that point, you have a 50/50 chance to profit $50 or lose $85. So as you can see, the EV would be -$35 if you did that to infinity. Here is a link where you can see all the guns from the 'Gods and Monsters' collection. It is what I used for reference in this example, however you can check out other collections to compare what you'd get. You will always find that there is a risk involved where you can either get 1 superior skin or 1 inferior skin. http://csgostash.com/collection/The+Gods+and+Monsters+Collection Furthermore, the quality of the items in your trade up have been proven to affect the quality of the skin you receive. So putting 10 factory new skins in a trade up contract effectively guarantees the skin you get will be either Minimal Wear or Factory New. HOWEVER (and this is a HUGE HOWEVER), certain skins DO NOT drop in equal percentages across the gun quality spectrum. A weapon like the AK-47 Fire Serpent has a VERY LOW percentage of Factory New quality and therefore it DOES NOT fall into this specific example. Another example of this would be the Factory New AK-47 Black Laminiate. Here is a link detailing the intricacies of exterior quality in trade-ups: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=420402033 TL;DR - The market has already figured this out. If there was any profit to be made by trading up, savvy investors have done it and inflated the prices of skins so that there is ALWAYS a huge risk in doing a trade up.",0.07,0.817,0.114,0.9688,8

I had a knife too but it was a mw ultra violet m9 bayonet...but here is where the story turns...I was playing a game when a player messaged me and being my dumb self I donated my knife to a giveaway and got scammed of my knife. Luckily I had my ak though. I was super mad and ended up visiting csgo jackpot...that night I risked my am fire serpent and won 1k dollars in skins! I WAS SOOO EXCITED. But again being my stupid self I accidentally bet the knife I won from the 1k bet. Then I that bet I accidentally bet on another man comes and dropped 3k! So I freaked out and bet the rest of my skins INCLUDING MY AK FIRE SERPENT....Sadly I had lost all my skins to a guy who bet 3k. Long story short I traded up to an AK fire serpent and a knife, got scammed, won a bet, lost my inventory.

1457724962,2016-03-11,"Fanobet gives you skins dependent on the skins you deposit. First it takes an average of all the skins you've ever deposited to their site. So lets say you deposit 10 skins at the following values: $1, $1, $2, $2, $2.5, $2.5, $4, $5, $5, and $10. The total is $35, divided by 10 skins, so your average is $3.5 Now Fanobet gives you a range, half of that, and double that. So for $3.5, your range would be $1.75 - $7. So when you go to withdraw skins, you'll get skins worth anywhere from $1.75 to $7, and likely some cheaper skins as well because it's a lower amount. If you were to withdraw $10 in skins, you probably wouldn't get a $7 and $3 skin, you'd likely get a bunch of $1.5 skins. The higher your deposits are, the more consistent the withdraws are, imo. One HUGE thing to remember is that every skins counts towards your average, so if you deposit nine 4 cent skins, and one $80 skin, your average would be around $8, so don't ever deposit skins just to get rid of them, you want to keep your deposits higher. What the OP is referring to is, when you do a withdraw on Lounge/Fanobet and it gives you a weapon, did it have any cool stickers on it? Was it worth more than lounge or Fanobet said it was? Like back in the day on Lounge when $60 was the max bet value, you could bet $120 FT Fire Serpents. I ended up winning a few and now they're worth $200+.",0.025,0.882,0.094,0.9432,1
