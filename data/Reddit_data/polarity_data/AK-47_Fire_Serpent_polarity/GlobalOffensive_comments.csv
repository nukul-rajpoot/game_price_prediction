You cannot assume the 30$ price tag of fire serpent means people like the skin more than some M4 which only costs 6$ if there isn't the exact same amount of both skins to begin with. Check minimal wear fire serpent and x-ray. Fire serpent fluctuates between 1 and 3 units sold each hour, x-ray goes as high as 7 units sold each hour. Going with your logic, the M4 price means people don't like the skin as much as they do fire serpent, and the reason it's cheaper than fire serpent is because the demand is lower. But it's not, so how does that make any sense? What this means, is that there are more x-rays than fire serpents on the market, which ultimately leads to the price dropping even despite higher demand. Now, imagine both skins being released at the same time, and valve giving 2000 of each away. Only in this scenario such comparison would've make sense. Right now we can only make assumptions because we don't know how many fire serpents and x-rays total dropped, so we cannot figure out how many people are holding onto their skins, but nonetheless there is no way this means people like the fire serpent more than x-ray just because the price is higher.

Bravo Case has 2 red skins where as the winter eSport case only has one which is X-Ray. Big factor that this dispute obviously does not bring to the table is that Fire Serpent is the only actually decent looking full color skin of the ak (Case hardened skins tend to look quite bad on lower detail levels). If M4 X-Ray would have been published alone, it would be far more pricey, however in the Winter Offensive case lies our answer to that: asiimov.

Why not let potential twitch viewers decide if we're what they are looking for by our comments and contributions. Example: Someone only likes to watch pros and can see I'm only a double AK.

Then they bet on ENCE, and get mad when they get 16-5'd by some pro team. ""gg ENCE fanboiz"" always works wonders getting people pissed off in the twitch chat.

Then NiP lose, and this idiot who bet all of his skins on the favored team now thinks NiP threw the game to get skins.

They usually have about 75-120 value of skins in their inventory. There's middle class, people who have maybe 50 value total, mostly skins worth 5-10$, they win some and they lose some but they sometimes know what they're doing. Then there's lower class. These guys have maybe 5-20 value total and probably make up about 80% of all the betters. Most are only betting because they don't have anything, and most really have no idea how the odds are calculated. They see 80%-20% on CSGL and think that there's an 80% chance of them winning. It's interesting how this sort of mirrors the lower class in society, both classes are uneducated, that is, they haven't really taken the time to *learn* how to make a profit...

For example, the [AK-47 Fire Serpent FT](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AK-47%20|%20Fire%20Serpent%20%28Field-Tested%29). Popular gun, popular skin, high value and easy to see fluctuations. **November 8th** - Weapon Case 2 introduced. Price drops 29%, takes 3 weeks to recover. **December 18th** - Winter cases introduced. Price drops 24%, takes 5 weeks to recover. **February 21st** - Phoenix Case introduced. Price drops 21%, takes 3 weeks to recover. **May 2nd** - Huntsman Case introduced. Price drops ~22%. Nothing to see here. The really big drops we're seeing on things like the [AK-47 Redline FT](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AK-47%20|%20Redline%20%28Field-Tested%29) and [AWP Asiimov BS](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AWP%20|%20Asiimov%20%28Battle-Scarred%29) are because they're from the Phoenix Case. There are lots of people ditching them to jump on the latest Huntsman skins, just as they ditched the Winter skins to jump on the Phoenix skins. The first case to follow a new case often causes the biggest drop. That's part of the natual short term drop in value. Look at the [SCAR-20 Emerald FN](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/SCAR-20%20|%20Emerald%20%28Factory%20New%29). Lost 45% in value when the following case came out (Weapon Case 2) and took 24 weeks to recover. Or the [P90 Emerald Dragon FT](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/P90%20|%20Emerald%20Dragon%20%28Field-Tested%29).

The [AWP Boom MW](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AWP%20|%20BOOM%20%28Minimal%20Wear%29) lost 33% when Bravo Case arrived, and it *never* recovered.

1400011296,2014-05-13,"Whether you should keep or sell the fire serpent depends on how long you would plan to keep it. When the fire serpent came out it was the only highly sought after AK skin, since the others were not very popular. The redline came out, and players looking for an AK skin now had more choices (thus reducing the amount of players looking to purchase a fire serpent). With the release of these latest cases the Vulcan has given the fire serpent some stiff competition. It is a very popular skin (although some people really don't like it), and with its release it has further reduced the amount of players interested in a fire serpent. From a statistical standpoint (assuming no change in the number of players) this would mean that prices would always drop. Two factors have to be considered. First: the playerbase is expanding at a rapid pace. Dreamhack and Katowice both had $3 sales along with lots of marketing from the tournaments, and each of them roughly doubled the number of players (if memory serves me correctly). These players bring fresh wallets to the table, and many of them are serious gamers who are willing to throw money into skins. Second: As the skins become older fewer are being opened, and some are being taken out of circulation by players not wanting to trade them, or quitting the game. This increased scarcity will slowly cause the prices to rise. This combined with an increasing playerbase will slowly result in higher prices on (many) older skins. My assessment: I always look at the long term prices of skins when I pick them up. If you are worried about what the fire serpent will be worth in 2 months, you will probably be disappointed, and it would be in your best interest to sell it (or better yet, trade it for stuff you want and save yourself a 15% cut). If you are truly looking long-term (say 2 years or so) then it would be in your best interest to save your fire serpent.",0.093,0.803,0.104,0.7441,2

Lets say that one person bet 4 High Value skins (Fire Serpent for example) on Lunatik, this will increase the % by quite a bit but it will not add a lot of skins to give out when the game ends. When many players bet a lot of high value skins on them the % will rise but there will be no low tier skins to give out to every winner (like you). There are cases where players that should get 10 dollars in return get a 40 dollar skin since they are the betters with the highest return in the current bet so they get the highest valuable Skin.

I don't drop large sums of money into it at once, but I get 2 case drops a week and have a couple alt accounts I might get a case or 2 on each a week if I use them as well. I have a job and work full time, nothing special a shitty job with shitty pay quite frankly, but at the end of the day 5-10 *gasp* even 15 dollars a week sometimes per paycheck is far from the end of the world. I'll open my cases I get as drops or sometimes if I don't have time to play and get all my drops I'll get some from my friends and will open a few a week here and there as I get them. For a long time I was out money but it's crazy how a few drops can change that. I got a ST Fire Serpent FT which almost broke me even, a while later got a knife worth maybe 100, then lost a lot more money, then in one week while I was on vacation spent a little extra money to open ~20 cases from friends and a few I had myself and got 3 knives in the course of a week. A Forest ddpat Karambit, M9 Crimson Web, and flip knife scorched. Just like that I went from slowly losing money over the course of the past year, to if I sold all of my things and ""cashed out"" I'd be walking away with a decent amount of money profit, but a nice chunk of cash to get at once as a lump sum as well. I look at it as playing the lottery, spend a little bit here and there, sometimes I get lucky and can make some money, most of the time I don't but that's why I only do it in small amounts that I get as drops or friends get and don't spend my money on the market buying cases and keys. That being said I have a friend who has spent between 4-500 dollars on keys and opening cases over the past year, and has an inventory worth maybe 50 dollars aside from a knife I lent him so I know it can work out horribly the other way as well, and at the same time there's people so much more lucky than me. All I can really say is if you're going to open cases, do it here and there over time. I don't think buying cases and keys and investing a lot of money and opening bulk cases at once is a good idea, you keep going and going always hoping and expecting that next one to have what you want. Plus as some other people have said, I'm investing in something I support and helping it continue to grow as well. CS GO is an extremely cheap game even when it's not on sale for what you get out of it, cheaper than any of the previous games were, and usually still are on Steam. It's a one time cost of 15 dollars and you never have to spend another dime ever again. They provide their own dedicated servers, as well as all of the match making stuff for free. They constantly update the game and fix bugs and listen to player feedback and work on trying to improve the game, as well as pushing out new content with the operations and skins and maps and tweaks and what not. I have no problem spending some extra money here and there to help support it and keep it running, not to mention having a chance, however small it might be, at making some money, possibly A LOT of money or at least what you spent on it, and getting some cool skins in game so I think it's worth spending some extra money here and there.",0.041,0.791,0.168,0.9981,1

I was just hinting at the fact that there is no superior institution that sets values and that value is in itself a construct (meaning you can't count it or hold it in your hands). I believe that also to be true for the value of money, actually there are a lot of interferences: - There is an institution that can flood the market (money: state, skins: valve) - You can only trade because both parties agree upon an interrelating ratio (1$ = 1/2 bread, 1 Fire Serpent = 2.1 Asiimov) There is of course an interface because you can, as you rightly said, give money into the system and take money out of it. But that is only transferring imaginary value from a very unstable market into a somewhat more stable one. Tl;dr: 1. ""Value"" is as much an illusion for skins as it is for money - money's value is just more stable because it is accepted (and used) more widely. 2.

Now this may make them seem simple because they follow the gun but if you look at the cartel collection, you could consider it simple (engravings) but if you look at the art its not simple. Stuff like the vulcan and your deagle (no offense) seems out of place and they dont suit the gun.

If you look at most of the popular AK47 skins on the market they accentuate or contribute to some element of the weapon model's design: * Laminate skins highlight the wooden detailing of the stock * Redline accentuates the contours of the weapon model as well as using an aggressive colour scheme to match the basic and slightly brutal design of the Kalashnikov * The serpent on the Fire Serpent mimics the shape of the barrel of the weapon Perhaps you should try some darker colourways, or altering the design itself to look more threatening. At the moment I think it's just a bit too NERF-y and not enough ""kills hundreds of thousands of people a year""-y.

When I first used the gun ingame, my firing rate increased up to 25%, and on the top of that the AWP's accuracy got better, then a message prompt will show you a secret bind that only you will know. And because I'm a good person, I will show my secret bind (by doing that I will lose 20% eyesight for a week, you guys owe me one.) It's called ""*limp node 1.2*"". It has one of those unique characteristics that after the halftime, if you got the first headshot right after the 3rd round, 1:12 of the game (that needs to be exact AND precise, or else the Dragon will fly out of your gun and be automatically transferred to your missed opponent, so be cautious when doing this... you need practice.) I tried it once with the help of the AK-Redline (+95% headshot accuracy) my teammate drop me, oh boy the experience was great, I hurried up to middle after I dropped the AK, then pick up my AWP and proceed to peek. After that things got so bad that I pity my enemies, after I killed the other AWPer by headshot, he suddenly got kicked out of the game, then I looked unto his Steam account, I was surprised that there was a dragon flying all over his steam profile saying ""The Dragon destiny is frowned upon you."" Then after the game we won, all my teammates but me, got a drop of Desert Eagle Naga, I was surprised as I listen to the tick sounds from the chat that I was the only one who didn't get the drop. But instead dropped me 2 AK Fire Serpents, after that my Dragon Lore became Factory New, but it's look became battle-scarred.

Fire Serpent, to be blunt, was HELLA risky. Cheapest item to trade-up was Stattrak P90 Emerald Dragons (~$15 each cheapest, higher now) but 50-50 shot at either the godly Stattrak Fire Serpent, or just a Stattrak Desert Eagle Golden Koi. M4 Asii isn't even worth it to trade up. It trades up from the P250 Mehndi, Awp Redline, and M4A1-S Guardian, all of which are worth more x10 than a Stat M4 Asii (or Stat Sawed-Off Kraken...the alternative to the M4 Asii). The only way you could make profit in this trade-up was to put in x10 BS or WW Stat P250 Mehndis and hope for a FT Asii, which as previous experience shows, is very unlikely (the wear of the inputs does seem to affect the wear of the output).",0.089,0.833,0.078,0.2387,7

This took maybe 5 months of trading 6 hours a day 5 or mors days a week (in between working) Your best option is trading your knife for keys or liquid items (items very easily tradable such as awp asiimov of mw vulcan) and then trading up. E.g get 30 keys from your knife, buy 2 awp asiimov fts for 14 and then sell them both for 16 keys. BOOM, you made 4 keys profit. Keep doing that until you build up more and more profit, then move up in trading, such as buying ft fire serpents.

We played with eachother one game when we were only silvers, both looking out for some players to queue with as it helps so much ranking up. After playing a couple games together we became really close friends, like always playing with eachother, always chatting. I've never been much of a gambler, I dabbled in csgl, had a hot run and ended up selling all my assi's for a knife and vowed to never do it again but my mate had a bad jackpot problem, every week, even day to day sometimes he would have no skins or new skins for guns he had won from csgofast. he even changed the end of his name to &lt;csgofast&gt;. But since he idnt have too many rich skins and he wasnt putting more money into it I didnt think of it too much of a big deal. Then he came upon some real money, he never told me how I think it could of been an inheritance or something, but he got 10k one day and heres where everything went wrong. At first he bought all the skins he wanted, he had something for every skin, fire serpant, master piece, bayo tiger tooth, kara night etc. then he won a jackpot, suddenly had 3K inventory, then he lost one then won again. Suddently he had a 7 k inventory. He started giving all his friends (incluing me) free skins because he could. i kept telling him he should stop, he said I was right and should quit while ahead but thats not how addiction works. I didnt go online for a while since i was at my folks place for a few weeks but when i did check I saw my friend had changed the end of his name to &lt;rip 10K invo&gt;. Shocked i messaged him about it, no reply. After some hassling he finally replied saying he made a big mistake and felt hell shit and had lost all 10K he had recieved. i told him id give back all the skins he gave me but told him you cant gamble these away. Atfter no problems for a while i get a message from him asking to borrow my hypereast, i was super hesitant but thought alright but you cant gamble it and you have to give it back tomorrow. The next day i check his account, no skins, try to message him, no reply, message some of his other friends, turns out he had borrowed some of their skins and had even tried to use some of their knives for sniping, losing all of them. Even now i havent gotten a reply from him, the kid is 16 and it goes to show what gambling to an extent but especially underage gambling can do, he was one of my best friends but gambling literally turned him into another person and made him hurt all his friends around him (RIP m4 hyperbeast ;_;)",0.127,0.726,0.147,0.9512,1

Then I don't run into situations where a person and I agree on a trade then they see my inventory and decide to swap items for something I don't want to trade and that breaks the deal. * I can manage the overall value of my bankroll better when I can assess the pool of what I'm using to bet/trade without having to parse out the number of skins that are not part of that pool. I have rules around how much of my inventory value can be tied up in betting at a single time, and track my ROI (I'm not anal retentive or anything, this is fun side game for me to see how much value I can amass from a small original investment of $~25 a year ago).",0.046,0.849,0.105,0.9236,6

Compare this to, for example, an AK Vulcan. A Huntsman case only costs like 30 cents or whatever, so more people buy it just to open it.

The Fire Serpent was in the Operation Bravo case, which launched on September 19, 2013. So more than a year went by for it to reach $80, and 13 months later it went up another $120.

The other Covert should be clearly inferior (Mac10 Neon, M4 Desert, Deagle Golden Koi) because it makes the risk-reward of the tradeups really high. It makes it so that demand stays high on the case while supply remains low, since trade-ups aren't going to happen often. When both Coverts are comparable, neither too good or too bad, then the value of the case skins quickly drops. Falchion's a good example of that with the Aquamarine-Hyper Beast; so is Chroma 1 and Vanguard.

1449970287,2015-12-13,"He's trying to swindle you, lol.. which is pretty normal for a younger brother to do let's face it. The cases/skins are purely 100% cosmetic and offer nothing to the game other than increasing your vanity over a game. They don't make you better at the game(contrary to popular belief lol) or anything like that. They are more of a ""status"" indicator than anything else. Me personally, I have maybe $25 of skins in my inventory. I don't have a knife but I'm sure at some point I will... but I basically have a cool looking skin for every gun.. and that's all I need. I'm 29 - I could care less about having an uber leet howl, dragon lore or Fire Serpant.. but the cheaper skins I have just give me something interesting to look at. Unfortunately the gambling isn't going to stop unless he wants to stop or you MAKE him stop. It's very easy to access for anyone. CSGO Lounge is practically integrated into the game itself(not really) and is always advertised for any competitive matches or tournaments - and there's no age limit. As long as you have skins in your inventory, you can bet. It's an open door to everyone and anyone, as long as you have skins. All the guns in the game are given to you when you buy the game. Don't let him trick you lol. All your doing is getting skins to make your guns look ""cooler"".. and some skins are much more expensive than others.. so there's a rare chance you can make a profit simply by getting lucky when opening the skin cases. It's rare but it happens with a little bit of luck. What most people forget to realize is that you will spend far less money just buying the skins you want on the market place, and foregoing the cases all together. You can also trade for skins(CAREFULLY) via certain sites that use bots to try and ensure a fair trade takes place. So if you have a skin and want a different one of equal value, you can offer to trade for it, etc. It's quite a complex system to wrap your head around at first. I know when I first came back to CS:GO, I was taken aback by the skin system. The betting. The trading. The cases. I had never seen this level of interaction in any other game or game community. If I were you, I'd take some time and do the research about it that way you can decide for yourself if you would like to keep purchasing things for your little brother.

1453680322,2016-01-25,The Urban Hazard Skins would be much more expensive if they weren't blue/purple I think. I also think that the howl or fire serpent wouldn't be that expensive since many people want kinda authentic look on their guns. I feel like an ak red laminate or m4 guardian would be way more expensive since they're minimalistic and actually not that far from being repainted in rl. Sure someone did the Dlore in real life but literally no one would put a camo like that on their gun in rl.

You'll notice the prices have barely shifted, and if anything have slowly decreased. Items like the graphite, ocean foam, hive and boom, all increased b.c of trade ups and lack of that collection case dropping. But all in all, most things are either stable, or decreasing (besides ibuypower stickers, which have their own set of rules for economy since it's believed there is or was gauging going on).

If somneone could find a statrak fireserpent with 4 holo Katowice 2014 stickers, then they wouldn't buy $1000 in stickers. Ok, even if things like your trade pass thing become more popular and widespread....even that will LOWER the price of stickers. If he can find 4 holo Katowice 2014 sticker thru your method then he wouldn't need to buy the sticker, making them lose their appeal. It could be something like that, it could be Valve adding an easier to use sticker search function, it could be CSGO lounge adding more feature like Valve's, it could even just be a youtuber telling non-traders how to find the guns they want without buying individual stickers.... But it is going to have to be something that becomes extremely popular among mainstream CS GO players, not just popular among hardcore traders for it to crash the individual sticker market. Point is, any of these things could happen...and if it becomes widespread enough, STICKER VALUES WILL DROP! You said it yourself, some people put expensive stickers on guns because they like how they look and cant find versions of that gun with stickers already on them, if they could find those guns with stickers then whats the point of an individual sticker being expensive besides the fact its in low quanitity? So many thing could happen that will make it much easier to list and sell stickered guns...or an already known method like what you listed or what I listed will gain popularity among the majority of players....ANY ONE OF THESE THINGS HAPPENING WILL DECREASE THE VALUE OF INDIVIDUAL STICKERS! And I don't think it will be bad for most people, just those holding on to a ton of unused stickers...That's why I am telling people about this prophetic vision of sticker armagaben.

Couple pages of cases and cheap drop skins. You'd think he would have a couple of other nice ones, or at least a ton of cases/drops. You would also expect him to equip the shiny new skins he just traded to his account, most likely from an alt. But no, he deliberately trades them over, and proceeds to do nothing with them. Also, I'm not going to say my anecdotal evidence proves anything, but I have a good number of hours in the game, and nearly every time I look in someone's inventory right after they get an item, it is there. An inventory not updating within a few minutes is already pretty unlikely, but it just so happened that it didn't update for at least 20 minutes, while the guy had just gotten a set of *identical* items to someone else in the server? *Two* people with a Fade, Fire Serpent, Howl, Dragon Lore, and M9 Doppler?

1467900716,2016-07-07,"Trading is done on /r/GlobalOffensiveTrade but to answer your questions: 1: The float value determines how much your skin i scratched. Generally speaking a gun with a 0.002 float will have less scratches than a 0.38. Also every weapon has a FV range, fire serpents only go to 0.06 so a 0.06 FS is rarer than a 0.06 5-7 Kami to have an example. Also some people like to collect skins with extremely low floats like 0.00000 ones and shit. You can find out your FV by copying the inspect link of the gun into [Metjm](http://metjm.net/csgo/) and it'll generate a screenshot with the float in it. 2: Because keys are easier to sell on sites like [OPSkins](https://opskins.com/). When you're buying/trading a gun for keys the seller will normally ask for less than if you want to pay in skins.

The fact that the steam community market exists is enough proof of that. And further, the insane value of some skins is evidenced by the existence of 3rd party websites like OPSkins or BitSkins, which have not only remained solvent but have been flourishing. So, you open a case and get a skin, which can then be sold on steam or elsewhere (OPS/BS) for real money, relatively risk free. That's monetary value. For example, say you were to open yourself an Operation Bravo Case (around $8-$10 on steam market plus a $2.50 key) - somehow, you unbox a ST FN Fire Serpent. It's one of the most coveted skins in the game (the cheapest one currently listed for sale is $4100 on OPSkins). Your $10-$12 ""lotto ticket"" (case/key) hit the jackpot and you're left standing with an item worth *thousands of dollars* (that's way better than the BS Nova Tempest, which sells for ~$0.66, right?).

1469639342,2016-07-27,"In Dota they were converted into chests.. and you would open the chest directly. No more buying keys.. only buy the chest and I could be wrong but they changed the way it was randomized so you could buy ten chests and each time get a new item until you got all ten items in the chest with a random chance at a rarer item. So if they did that with CS Keys your vangurd keys would turn into vanguard chests and if you opened it would give you 1/14 possible items. Then if you opened a new vanguard case it would not repeat the item you already got. Dota 2 items didnt really have a structure with reds blues and purples so much since they didn't have a trade up contract.. so I have no idea how they plan to change the ""gambling"" problem their government has against the keys. The major problem i see is the value of cases, some cases are worth 10$ but you need a $2.50 key to open it.. if they plan to make cases disappear that be bad for those case holders. And besides the effect of keys, its a huge effect on red's and purples.. if I wanted a fire serpant I would simply have to open 15 Bravo cases until I got one.. So a max amount of $37.00 to get one with a chance at getting a knife with it.. Reds and purps will drop hard if they stick with this formula.",0.109,0.839,0.052,-0.9327,2

I'm just saying that for now, I felt satisfied with my interaction with it. &gt;You traded a gut knife and an Icarus for a FT Blue Steel Karambit, not the other way around. Very few user, if any, will trade down. How do you think the website will keep supplying FT Blue Steel Karambits or better skins? They're going to have to get rid of their cases/sand dunes/storms by mass selling them on the market, with all the people that will sell their penny skins, these will be used to buy more tempting skins to keep interest afloat. Like OPSkins and such, they make a cut from all sales which some will have to be re-invested to keep stock fresh. I didn't make the website so I don't know the inner workings or grand plans they have for it, but that's my rough guess. &gt; How is it profitable for the site to get stuck with a bunch of dollar skins? Because your items are 80 - 95% their worth when depositing for web-currency, that's where they make their money, just like how double used to do it. Obviously it's not some samaritan website made to turn your Elite Build into a Fire Serpent or your Moon in Libra into a Medusa, but the deals are there if you look for them. The karambit I got was in an incredibly good float as well, so I knew that I was getting a good deal for my items (*which even if it wasn't a good float, the items I traded, if added up, didn't even equal the karambit in OPSkins nor Steam Market when the purchase was made*).

1475696780,2016-10-05,"&gt;insert meme about RisenLazarus riding Bryce's coattails every time something happens Bryce pretty much covered everything that most people in the general public would care to know. When the complaint came out, I said that it would get 12b6'd (geeky lawyer talk for dismissed) because it's lacking in a lot of factual issues. I'm just going to elaborate a bit on two topics because they're interesting to me and maybe interesting to you all. **Gambling as ""injury""** Bryce mentioned that the ruling makes clear that losses from gambling do not qualify as ""injury"" under the RICO standard. This is so well-trodded ground that it might as well be black letter law: you can't sue for racketeering just because the odds didn't play out for you. And this should make sense *if* you have a solid understanding of what gambling really is. Gambling is the paying in to a game where in your expected value is *always* less than what you put in. But why is that? Well it's because what you're actually paying for is the thrill and engagement of gambling itself. The rush of having money on the line and not knowing whether you'll get it back, knowing there's a chance you can come out big; THAT'S what gambling is. Losses are expected, and because of that you cannot reasonably call them an ""injury"" under the law. Now I bring this up because it's relevant for something else CSGO players like to care about: cases. In the dismissal, the court mentions another case that Valve relied on in the dismissal. I haven't read it myself, but based on the court's description it involved trading card packs like Magic, Yugioh, or Pokemon booster packs. Those of us who grew up collecting/playing know that while you MAY get an incredibly rare or strong card at times, more often than not you are going to wind up disappointed. BUT the thrill of opening the pack (and for odd kids like me, smelling the newly printed cards... I know, weird) is PART of the value you're paying for. **So case openings are gambling? Not quite** So why isn't it gambling? I think most people have a gut reaction that of course trading card boosters, csgo cases, and all luck-based game microtransactions (like Blade and Soul P2W boxes... fuck that game btw) aren't ""gambling"" or at least shouldn't be regulated like them. But they're still addictive and in worst cases ruinous. So why aren't they ""gambling?"" The difference, as I see it, is that the value of those events aren't determinative of their outcome potential. Now that sounds ridiculous. What I mean is that the chance of you getting a valuable item isn't based on how valuable it is. In fact it's the opposite: the value of it is based on how rare it is for you to get it. So while a casino can put a quarter million dollar prize on a royal flush for a machine poker game (Idk if that's accurate at all lmao), the ""value"" of an AK-47 Fire Serpent isn't used to determine how rarely it drops. Valve gives it a rarity, and then community market and buyer choice determines how much they cost. Similarly, Konami didn't make Solemn Warning or Pot of Duality (idk if these are still rare; I haven't played yugioh on a while) valuable and then decide to put few into packs because of how valuable they were. They made them rare/difficult to obtain, and the community assigned value as a result. I believe this is the operative difference both conceptually and legally that is drawn between gambling/wagering which is heavily regulated and luck-based transactions that are less so. **On the claims of fraud** This section will be shorter because Bryce more or less covered it all. I wanted to say something about this part of Bryce's post: &gt;the court held that plaintiffs “allegations do not support claims of dishonest conduct.” The court did a bit more than to just say the allegations didn't support the conduct. When you make a claim against someone in a court of law, you have to both show that an act occurred *and* that the act **caused** you an injury. So if I sue someone for punching me, I have to prove that he (1) threw a punch (act), (2) the punch hit me (BAD act), and (3) the punch led to bruising, broken jaw, brain damage, etc. (causation). The complaint here alleged that TMartn and co. COULD have been rigging bets because of their undisclosed ownership. It also alleges that not disclosing ownership was itself a fraud since people might not have engaged with the site if they had known. But where it fails is that it (1) never proves that such rigging did actually occur but more importantly (2) it never proves that *if it did occur* that rigging **was during one of the plaintiff's games** and thus caused him to lose money. We don't allow people to sue for bad acts that injure other people; that's an issue called ""standing."" You YOURSELF have to actually be harmed by it, and you have to be able to prove it. They couldn't here, so the court threw that part out.",0.097,0.803,0.101,-0.7423,37

Personally I think the default AK is really ugly, so I bought a Blue Laminate MW. This skin is much like the default AK, but with blue veins running through the wooden sections. I find this to be nicer to look at, so I kept it. 2) Stattrak™ skins (which count the number of human players you have killed) demonstrate the level of dedication you have to the game. Stattrak might be rarer (and this generally more expensive), but they show how much effort you have put into learning and perfecting the game. Yesterday my AK Blue Laminate (which is Stattrak) clocked its 5000th kill. Pro player Shroud from Cloud9 has an Stattrak AK Fire Serpent which recently clocked its 100000th kill.

1500371645,2017-07-18,"Sorry for the long essay, but I'm gonna give you my thoughts that may help you cause I went through this myself (maybe like 2 years ago, I feel I'm a lot more mature now). You'll always be unsatisfied if you are going for status symbols instead of being happy because you actually like it. Think about it, do you get jealous because you really like how that howl/dlore looks or do you just want the envy/attention/coolness factor and self-validation that having the howl/dlore brings you? Be honest to yourself, lore is pretty fancy and nice since there's no actual full golden flashy awp quite like it but honestly, if the howl came out in a case as a red right now it will just be the same status as bloodsport, a nice high tier ak skin but nothing to drool and lose your mind over unless you really personally like the skin. If the fireserpent came out in a new case, everyone would be complaining what an ugly red it is and it would be a niche skin like the wasteland rebel. Like personally I don't care about tiers or how expensive the skins are these days, I just care about how nice it looks. Like the recent case, I think that usp blueprint (a blue tier skin) is so nice and ended up replacing my neo noire usp (which was cool in the beginning but it got lame since in reality it's just a colorful blob since you can't really see the artwork unless you constantly press f). Especially once you actually played with/owned skins like howl/fs long enough, you realize there's nothing special about it aside from the fact that it's a standard $50 red skin that got contraband/scarce and it's rare and expensive now which gets you (pointless) attention from younger kids and teenagers. Howls still a nice skin, but you can see this mindset of ""getting over it"" from a lot from pro players who I see use cool souvenir m4's and ak's/desolate space or buzzkill or dragon king with their sigs on them alot even though they can use and get a howl anytime they want. Since pros can usually get whatever they want, they use shit they actually like such as the m4a4 x-ray (really underrated m4 skin, love the color and concept and looks great with stickers or plain), if you ever watch apEX from g2 play he's been using a ST m4a4 x-ray since forever (although he switches it off sometimes). I end up getting rid of my howl for a souvenir radiation hazard (amazingly cool combo), x-ray and now a buzzkill. Plus if you don't actually love the skins, all these status symbol skins end up being boring and stale and once you have them it's like whatever, and you end up getting rid of them for shit you actually like. I used to drool over howls and fireserpents, then after I got them, I felt stupid after a while since I didn't really like those skins (just wanted them cause they were high tier) and ended up selling them. That's why fire serpents never really go skyrocket in price, because they just keep getting cycled from people who never had them who fiend for them (since it's the most expensive ak skin) who end up getting bored/realizing they don't actually like how it looks and then selling it off to the next person who's just like them. Plus you should be getting skins for yourself because you like them, if you're getting skins based on what people think/envy or how the community ranks it then it ends up kind of sad because it just means you're getting skins for attention and validation from random strangers who really could care less about you instead of for yourself. If you like it and it makes you happy (regardless of the price/tier/avg community opinion), that's what really matters. I feel like once you get these kind of skins, you just ""get over it"" and start seeing it for what it is (maybe try !ws !knife arena servers and play enough and maybe you'll experience it, the funny thing is I noticed the people on those servers don't even use the howl/serpent/lore much unless it's a newcomer since once you remove the money and rarity factor it's just a overblown hyped skin that they realize they don't even like). Basically, if you are lusting and envying for whatever is the best (instead of whatever you like), it's just a meaningless endless cycle. There's always something more expensive as a status symbol and always insecure people who are willing to spend more money than you to prove it; I admit that there are really expensive nice skins that are enjoyable to use (for me, sapphire knives are really nice) but that doesn't seem to be what the real issue is since you are ""getting frustrated since I don't have the BEST inventory"" and say ""let me buy howl dlore ruby sapphire and realize i'm not satisifed yet"" and you say you have ""enough money to get better stuff than that"" when someone suggested some cheaper cool looking skins, as if price/money/rarity is your sole factor in deciding what's a ""better skin"" and what you want. If you're wanting to get validation/satisfaction from what random people (who could care less about you) think is cool, you just need to mature a bit imo. Look how many people get bored so quickly after getting their ""dream knife"" (usually a expensive high tier knife), it's because once you have it it's not as glamorous anymore and what you don't have is always more appealing than what you have and usually they just lusted after it since it was so coveted and rare and high tier and it was a goal. And then they sell it off and end up just buying something (usually cheaper) that they actually like and keep it for longer. After all, it's just skins, it should just be visually appealing to you in game when you play, you shouldn't be obsessing over them like this! Nowadays I just sell skins whenever I'm bored of it and I buy whatever catches my eye next, I don't think much about it and I sure as hell don't give a second thought about another guy using more expensive skins or having a crazy inventory, good for him if that's what makes him happy! I'm sure there was a time for you when cs go was so fun and addicting even while using a default ak/m4 (alot of traders end up realizing that obsessing about skins is a waste and burden in your life which is why you always see people with $1000+ inventories cash out and just end up use the most basic/default shit), just stop worrying about skins and focus on gameplay more.

The CSGO economy is based on trust, if Valve start fucking with it by changing things like key prices or weapon drop rates, it would destroy any trust people have in the system, and people would be less inclined to use it. Obviously a greater abundance of items on the Steam market drives down price, so an item's scarcity is directly related to it's price. Whenever a new case or skin comes out it's initially extremely expensive due to it's relative rarity, then slowly comes down in price and levels out. It's the same thing as prices for skins going up once the boxes they came from stopped dropping. You only have to look at the price-history of skins like the Fire Serpent or Graphite to realise this, people didn't suddenly just start loving those skins, their price simply increased due to becoming more rare.

You can only get it from opening [Bravo cases](https://csgostash.com/case/3/Operation-Bravo-Case) which are very old and extremely rare. In 6k hours of playing I've only once gotten this case in a weekly drop and some people never get it. One of these cases costs 10$. &amp;#x200B; The reason it's so rare and almost impossible to get in FN condition is because it has a minimum float value. Which means only if you are lucky enough to get this skins to be between 0.06 and 0.069 float, only then it's going to be factory new. All other AK skins from every case that exists can have any float and it's not rare to get them in FN or any other condition.

Near perfect scrapes on MiBR on the wood as well as both signatures (Fallen's looks funky because of the geometry of the gun but that's how it is with the 2nd rear spot of the AK).

I got a little greedy on the NaVi logo. I had a near-perfect look at 6 scrapes but I scraped once more to try and get rid of a left-over spot from the sticker background. Ended up taking a tiny bit of the logo off but it still looks decent all things considered, especially in that spot of the AK which is pretty notorious for scraping badly.

It looks nice because it shines symmetrically with the iBP Holo. - And here are just some other/mess-around/test skins (rip FPS, these were taken on my laptop): - **[AWP | Graphite](https://imgur.com/whcYNDz)** (Titan) (pretty much my pride and joy) - **[AWP | Phobos](https://imgur.com/t38ca5N)** (NaVi) - **[AK-47 | Redline](https://imgur.com/3pYn5QF)** (coL Before/After) - **[AK-47 | Elite Build](https://imgur.com/aKkoZ3Z)** (NaVi) (I use this for DM to track kills, not too concerned about the wear) - **[AK-47 | Black Laminate](https://imgur.com/mzfYf1d)** (SK) (original and inspiration for the mibr Fire Serpent) - **[AK-47 | Vulcan](https://imgur.com/XzUhftM)** (FaZe) (these are both near-perfect foil scrapes) - **[Glock | Candy Apple](https://imgur.com/aRugYRv)** (G2) - **[M4A1-S | Bright Water](https://imgur.com/F1FHfKA)** (Liquid) - **[USP-S | Orion](https://imgur.com/oow7xit)** (Fnatic/Godsent) (I'm not really satisfied with this result, have to redo this some day) - **[Deagle | Urban DDPAT](https://imgur.com/imEDVA3)** (G2) (none of these are scraped, the sticker designs blended well with the skin) So as you can see, you can work around the large backgrounds/tournament logos. I personally really look forward to Majors because I'm super excited about making new crafts and seeing how scrapes work. It can also be pretty affordable—most of the expensiveness is from multiple retries because of botched scrapes.",0.084,0.759,0.157,0.9888,32

I did it solely for the enjoyment of seeing my own guns in their matches, I'm a big NAVI fan so it's amazing watching those guys use them (every player has used both guns in their matches, I've kept track lol). Since Flamie already knew about the AWP, I messaged him again in January asking if he wanted to borrow the Fire Serpent since it's also a cool NAVI-themed skin, he said sure, and that was that! I still have both of them added, it's been almost a year now, and they've been very nice and professional with me, so it's all-around been a great experience, and honestly still gives me a rush when I see them get used in their matches.

Xiuhcoatl is a Classical Nahuatl word that translates literally as ""turquoise serpent"". The name also carries the symbolic and descriptive meaning ""fire serpent"". Xiuhcoatl was a common subject of Aztec art, including illustrations in Aztec codices, and was used as a back ornament on representations of both Xiuhtecuhtli and Huitzilopochtli. **[Huītzilōpōchtli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huītzilōpōchtli)** &gt;In Aztec mythology, Huitzilopochtli (Classical Nahuatl: Huītzilōpōchtli [wiːt͡siloːˈpoːt͡ʃt͡ɬi], modern Nahuatl pronunciation ) is the deity of war, sun, human sacrifice, and the patron of the city of Tenochtitlan. He was also the tribal god of the Mexicas, also known as the Aztecs, of Tenochtitlan. Many in the pantheon of deities of the Aztecs were inclined to have a fondness for a particular aspect of warfare. However, Huitzilopochtli was known as the primary god of war in ancient Mexico. ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&amp;message=OptOut&amp;subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",0.093,0.855,0.052,-0.8225,3
