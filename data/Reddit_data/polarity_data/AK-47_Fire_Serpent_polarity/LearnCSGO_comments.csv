1443971593,2015-10-04,"Hey tolos, that is a great question. There is no ""favoritism"" between items in a trade up. Example: If you trade up 10 AWP Graphite / P2000 Ocean Foams (both are pinks from the bravo collection) - there is a 50% chance of you recieving an Ak-47 Fire Serpent and 50% chance of your recieving a Desert Eagle Golden Coi. A great tool that many people use to predict the exact wear and probability of recieving each weapon in a trade up contract is CSGO Exchange. Hope this helps you out, best of luck!",0.063,0.698,0.238,0.9628,4

That's why alot of people craft expensive skins with the lowest floats as, not only are they expensive, but it's also somewhat a flex (for example) ""I have the #1 float Fire Serpent in the world"".",0.089,0.911,0.0,-0.5994,1
