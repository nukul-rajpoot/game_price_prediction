If they introduce the mission drops as regular drops the price will decrease in half, maybe even more. Wouldn't invest, but if you really want to, i'd only keep it for one month, since breakout will end on october 2nd. Knight - same goes the knight, althought due to the dragon lore it might increase in price, which makes it an ok small time investment (one month max) NOTE ABOUT THE SERVER DROPS: valve might also make the pass 75 % cheaper, resulting in much more people having the pass, which in turn means much more knights / masterpieces / dragon lores. Supply will increase, demand will most likely not. Fire serpent - always had a huge demand, liked by a lot of people. The price already increased a lot, as bravo cases become more expensive it will rise. Althought you should know that with an introduction of a covert ak skin the price will drop 15 %. it's a hard investment, a tad too late. Glock fade - too late to invest, unless you can find one for 120 euro, which would be ok as it will rise. Won't double the price like it did in two weeks tho. Deagle blaze - good investment, would def. pick one up as it will 100 % go up in price and is a safe investment. There are better things to invest then these weapons tho.",0.049,0.771,0.179,0.9892,1

I think it's a certainty that it'll drop for everyone when Breakout ends, just like Phoenix did. It's a community workshop skin case and Valve have never ceased one of those before, so I think it'll be around for a long time.

1411843704,2014-09-27,"There are several things going on at once, so different skins are getting hit by different price drops. Please excuse me if my dates are out by a day, I'm in Australia so market graphs adjust for my timezone. The [M4 Cyrex](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/M4A1-S%20|%20Cyrex%20%28Factory%20New%29) is going the craziest at the moment. What happened is when Valve dropped the [Breakout Pass](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Operation%20Breakout%20All%20Access%20Pass) price to $1 on Sept 11th, tons of new people bought it and started playing and got Breakout Case drops. If you look at the market availability for the [Breakout Case](http://steamcompanion.com/csgo/Operation-Breakout-Weapon-Case/), it surges right after the 11th and again a week later after the 18th, and building up again now. The personal weekly drop reset is fairly synchronised right now for this large group of people. We can see similar patterns when Breakout was new and case availability increased in roughly weekly waves (June 2nd, 9th, 17th, 24th, 31st, then fading as synchronisation dissipated). So that's what the M4 Cyrex is doing, and it'll probably only get worse. Much worse, if the Breakout Case goes public in a few days like the Phoenix Case did. If you have one, sell sell sell. It's hitting [other items](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Desert%20Eagle%20|%20Conspiracy%20%28Factory%20New%29) in the collection too. Next we have the ongoing price decline in items such as the [AWP Corticera](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AWP%20|%20Corticera%20%28Field-Tested%29) and [M4 Bullet Rain](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/M4A4%20|%20Bullet%20Rain%20%28Field-Tested%29). This is the natural decline of new items from the latest case (eSports 2014 Summer). It's to be expected. They'll drop further over time and take a real hit when the next collection is released. Next is the price decline from Sept 3rd, caused by the P250 buy-up and triggering widespread panic selling. Obviously the big ""investment"" skins like the [Glock Fade](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Glock-18%20|%20Fade%20%28Factory%20New%29) and [Fire Serpent](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AK-47%20|%20Fire%20Serpent%20%28Field-Tested%29) were hit the hardest, but others such as the [AK Redline](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AK-47%20|%20Redline%20%28Field-Tested%29) and [Glock-18 Candy Apple](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Glock-18%20|%20Candy%20Apple%20%28Field-Tested%29) have shown a steadier decline since then. I think this is a general loss of market confidence. Finally there's a decline in some prices beginning on Sept 20th. This is hitting the [Howl](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/M4A4%20|%20Howl%20%28Minimal%20Wear%29), [Vulcan](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AK-47%20|%20Vulcan%20%28Field-Tested%29), [AWP Asiimov](http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AWP%20|%20Asiimov%20%28Battle-Scarred%29), and others.

1420311744,2015-01-03,"Welcome to a really hard market. First of all, this market is completely manipulated by people who had experience with Dota and TF2 market. Those guys are the ones making a lot of money right now. So my guess is you already have some understanding of it, you have a chance in here. In CS GO market there are a lot of kids that don't understand the concept of economics and basically they buy ""what they think"" will be ""an incredible investment on 3 days"". That’s the reason why this market is really hard because one ""investor"" can start a rumor and you will see a suddenly increased price on one item droping hard in the next hours. The next really important thing that you have to be always aware of (and most of these investors always forget), is the fact that this market is really new and the player base is growing really fast day by day. Last winter we were 500k players on this game and now in this winter we are almost 3.5 million players. That being said you have to realize that ""past events"" are NOT a good point of info since the number of players moving the market is totally different. Add to these that most of the guys that you will find in this forum post a LOT of misguided comments on investments. I have been following the CS GO market day by day (several times a day) since it started and that’s why I am letting you know all these. Now regarding your questions: Yes older cases are a good way to go (same as Dota and TF2 market), the main reason is because they became rarest while the player base keeps growing plus they have some desirable skins on it (AK Fire Serpent in the Bravo Cases). Most of those cases are NOT being opened but stocked on investors’ inventories waiting for profits. That’s is why you can find daily changes on price up to 30% (Bravo cases). Some guys buying because they see a little increase on price and other sale them because they see a little dropping in price (all cases). 1) They increased price because some of the guys (manipulating the market) bought a nice amount of them based on the “wishes” of many “investors” believing that would go up hard in the next few months. All they had to do was bought a few hundreds to start the “hype, which was already created around them, in order to sale them back a few hours after with a huge profit. Once the hyped was created, thousands of “investors” bought them, so there are a huge amount of them ready to go back to market for a profit sitting on inventories. Remember there is no a secure way to know what will happen to them because of the market being so new, so what I think is that they will fall hard when the next newer case is released, since most of them will be back on the market in order to get money back to buy the new ones. 2) If you got the idea of what I just told you, any case could have the same future, what you have to do is to have your eyes really open and read a lot on forums about what “investors” think will rise. You can start the hype (if you know what I mean). 3) Nobody really knows for sure, it is up to Valve. A lot of guys were thinking that some Collections had no chance to go back and they started to buy skins from them, and suddenly in the next operation, most of those collections were back. Now regarding limited time offers… again… there is no way to know, since there is no historical data that could lead to a safe investment. Let me give you an example… Katowice Capsules/Stickers- Those were the first tournament stickers on game, nobody though (because there was no Historical data) that they could be so expensive on the future, and a little amount of them were bought (we were 750k players by that time). When ESL Capsules/Stickers came next, thousands of “investors” bought thousands of them with the hope that they will follow the same path of the Katowice ones. Again those “investors” didn’t realize that the amount of players was 2 million by then. Result… literally millions of those were sold. There are hundreds of thousands of those stickers/capsules siting on those guys inventories waiting for a time miracle profit. Regards and good luck!",0.043,0.859,0.098,0.9927,4
1420324895,2015-01-03,"Yeah I know. Sorry for my wall but formating text in here doesn't work for me. Yes... this market is really volatile. In lower price items could work if you ""drive"" the market buying a big ammount of items of the same skin. The real money is on high tier items. I don't know how expensive are the top items on Dota or TF2 but in CS GO, 1 knife went up to 25k usd. You can find items for 2000 to 8000 keys sold everyday. The 7 day limit is not working yet (as far as I know becuase I have been able to buy and sell the same day). CSGO have some discountinued items. In CS GO the most wanted items (skins) are the ones that Pro players use in big tournaments and the best looking ones. Yes older have a price to pay but they have to look nice too. On Bravo cases, for example, Fire Serpent is a desirable skin, but if you look closer to those skins there is a P90 with similar looks that is not ""that desirable"". Usually the most used weapons are the most desirable skins, like AK, M4, AWP, Glock P2000, and USP-S.

But I personally hate this tactic because of how long term it is, I really am too impatient. Then there is the faster but more expensive way, buying skins that gain value. A skin can gain value a lot faster than most cases, a 100$ skin can be 100$ one day and 200$ a month later (Fire serpents did something very similar). This tactic is quite expensive, but if you have the cash, an ocean foam p2000 would be good if you got it very soon. If you are willing to wait, case investments are awesome, but its all dependent on that. But if you really want to gain money somewhat fast, without trading up in csgo lounge, then I have just the thing for you. CSGO market knowledge buys. What I am talking about is learning and watching prices on csgo, find an item that you see go up and down from a certain price often, then buy on the cheap days and sell on the expensive days, you can make up to 30% margins within a few days on each item. Although I will not tell you all the items that I see this work on, I will tell you about one, just because I do not use it often, and it will show you what to look for. Desert Eagle Blaze factory new is good for this, although it might be becoming more stable sadly. The Deagle Blaze FN goes down to around 15$ about once a week but sells for around 23$ at high times during the week. That is around 6$ per Deagle, and although you may only be able to snag one or 2, you will find other items that this strategy works on that I haven't even found, I spend hours on the market to find these and I still only know a few, but you will find them and make profit week by week. That is my spiel, I am going to end this before it hits the cap. (one more thing, if you decide to do the deagle thing, then dont be afraid to buy at 16.50$ or higher, anything that will get you profit is good as long as your sure of yourself, some weeks you may make 6$ on these loopholes while on other days you may make a few cents, and do not forget that paying a few extra cents for stickers is worth it, people will pay a little extra to get items with stickers on market.)

You get a new item from that chest every time, so no doubles.. but there is a chance at a rarer item to be given with your normal item. I personally think valve will be lazy on coming to a new idea or terms to how chests will operate.

All couriers had an effect gem and and color. You could extract them with a chisel and then use the gem color on a different courier.

You will no longer receive duplicates in your case item drops.

There is no money in China if China Can't also buy from the market or in Game.. so this will happen and people that don't think so are lying to themselves.

Because when they launched DotA in China they gave couriers all sorts of customization and it sank everything down to a market value (very good for them). Now DotA makes so much money from the majors that It wouldn't surprise me if they also try to stick to a 3-4 major a year with crowd funding using some kind of compendium that gives you sprays/gloves(limited time during that major ofc) a few cases and whatever else based on the level of your ""compendium"".

There were so many people hoarding the later on Phoenix case etc and the rare skins within hoping that they would turn out to be bravo case and ak47 fire serpent.

Valve simply cannot out advertising them. If you say Fornite and PUBG is not the same game, Okay take a look at crossfire. Although crossfire is only popular in China, their profit is higher than cs go revenue and they are advertised a lot in China.

And the AWP Oni Taiji and Five SeveN Hyperbeast did not become some kind of holy grail tier skins, the skin community still stuck up with Katowice, Vulcan, Asiimov, Redline, Case hardened, fire serpent, Dlore, Howl, Medusa kind of early gen skins. Some factor involved is because CS:GO being a 7+ years old game, 3 new cases release every year, you just can't possibly maintain scarcity in the long run. And IMO the AWP Containment Breach looks worse than Oni Taiji, Mac-10 Stalker is pretty good but only AWP/M4/AK are qualified to become community sought after holy grail skins. Remember, the Hydra case is not 100% discontinued, it is just in the rare drop pool. And now it reached an equilibrium.

1587061705,2020-04-16,"&amp;#x200B; 1. When he says consider float values for the outcomes he means to look at the float range of the skins that you could get from the tradeup. For example in the glove collection the classified skins have a float range of 0-.75. Since there are only 75% of the floats that are possible to get you only need an average float of &lt;.09333 to get factory new (.07/0.75=.0933). There are some skins, like the fire serpent, that have not just a maximum float range but also a minimum. In the fire serpents case it is .06-.76. To calculate that you simply put in the maximum wear you can get as an outcome (for mw it would be .15 rounded) into the equation then subtract the minimum float for the outcome. Then you divide that by (max float - min. float). The full equation to get a mw fire serpent is (.15-.06)/(.75-.06)=.1286 is the max avg float you can have. You will need to do this for every outcome or at least the one with the worst float range. 2. I kind of answered this question in the last one but I mostly go through csgo exchanges collection page which shows you all the items approximate prices and float ranges. [https://csgo.exchange/collection/#](https://csgo.exchange/collection/#). I then just go through the collections and look for areas that I might be able to make money. 7x MW and 3x fn is common to look at then I kinda just guesstimate price of the tradeup and average outcome so I dont need to use a calculator every time. It will be a bit hard at first but trust me you get better and much quicker. You could also check out tradeuphero they have some tradeups that you can optimize or just look through the inputs to get inspiration. One more thing I would like you to keep in mind is its not necessarily about the profit % its about how many times you can do it. So a tradeup with 15% profit that you can spam may give you more profit than a 30% profit tradeup that takes a long time to do because you cant get the items. Usually you cant do tradeups from old collections because the volume is so low and/or most the low floats have been used or they want overpay for it.",0.061,0.842,0.097,0.9458,7

Easily 10 accounts at the same time. We had more than 2k drops. Still this could vary a bit, since the amount of rare drops for that is still quite low. Just my personal data showed 1/320. The 1 in 400 made sense to us since that is more or less the rarity of knives. To get really meaningful numbers you would need at least 100 rare drops. That's in some statistic studies the minimum for example for the vaccine data. The vaccine from CureVac had a really long study (don't know which phase it was) since they needed at least 100 infections in the control group to get meaningful and by the EMA accepted data. For cases if we assume 1/100 to 1/400 that would be 10-40k drops roundabout. We could all collect this data, but we would need to make sure everyone enters correct data. It can also be that valve changes the drop system in the background and since the numbers are so low we don't notice that fast if we even notice. They definitely change stuff in the background. For some time there was a 20% chance of an early drop last year, which meant the ones who play a few hours a week got an extra case every 5 weeks. It seems they removed that again since then. It would even make sense to up the rare case drops, since they are exciting to open and important to keep alive on the scm for the whole market. Very rare items like the fire serpent stay popular and desireable if you are able to open cases and get it. Valve is interested in keeping the balance of rarity but still keeping stuff popular and openable for older cases. The 1 in 100 you mention can actually be the case because of that. In the last few weeks i ran a few accounts and got 86 cases dropped. Interestingly i got 2 rare drops, not expensive ones (shadow and vanguard), but still suprisingly a lot.

If they are the same, it will probably fall in price and so on. If the skin is covert or not does not really matter imo, it all comes down to the demand of the skin + the supply. Basically like a market functions. Also another important factor is how old the skin is. For example the fire serpent. Its from the bravo collection. Only a few bravo cases are left over. At some point (maybe 1 year, maybe 10 years), this case will dissapear, so the fire serpent will rise in price. That works with every skin you want. It's just safe to say that older skins will at some point get more expensive. For newer skins (at the moment) it mainly depends on how many people want to play the skins and if the skin will be from a case or from a operation (so that the supply will end when the operation is finished). Etc. In fact you should buy some skins that you really like and stick to them. We never know what valve will do next and thats why there is no 100% safe way in investing skins.

Then it was pumped here and there, and skin prices within the case started rising not only due to the pumps but also due to the skin's supply. It was a vicious cycle of investors rising it's value, although justified since the case was dismissed (at the time) as a bad investment (*cough* Stockholm *cough*) while at the same time being one of the least unboxed and with low supply when it became a rare drop. Case has very little monthly unboxes due to it's price, nowadays one can consider the case's value ""fair"" due to the skin prices.

1686144342.0,2023-06-07,">You literally just proved my point. what? no i did not. You were saying old skins didn't plummet as new skins got introduced and this is factually wrong unless you're saying that any kind of increase makes an item a valid investment option. The M4A4 Zirka was introduced in 2013 and started at a price of 20$ despite, at this time, there was no way to sell your skins for actual money. Today it is 40$ which means it doubled its price in 10 fuckin years. And it's only 40$ because of the cs2 hype. It would actually be lower. Meanwhile a skin like the fire serpent, which looked better and is higher res, has about the same rarity and was introduced around the same time is 2600$ now which makes it about a 60-70x compared to the 2x of the zirka. So please tell me where did I prove your point... Keep your playskins man. I'm not trying to make anyone sell. But don't act surprised when your M4a4 asiimov FN sits at 100$ by the end of the year. Keep in mind that you shouldn't expect most people to act like you do. Yes, I'd use a nice old A4 skin over a bad new one.
