1404760621,2014-07-07,"I think I understood it now. Even though only like 5% of the OB Bets were big, these 5% made out like 70% of all the value placed on OB. Now HR won, but because there is noone getting 45 Dollar Returns because you cant bet 300 dollar at once, some people (like me) got a lot more than they shouldve been getting. In my case I got a Fire Serpent FT insted of 14 value http://prntscr.com/40c949 But because some people got more than they shoulve, because CSGO Lounge cant split items, other people got less than they shouldve or even nothing. And even if this seems to be pretty unfair at first, it's actually pretty logical and as CSGO Loot won't be able to split items too, they will pretty likely be faceing the same problem.
