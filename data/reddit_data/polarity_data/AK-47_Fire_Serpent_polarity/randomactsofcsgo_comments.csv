Fire Serpent - 'The Offering' Following what the other guy said about the aztec god, doing a bit of research into said god (which makes the gun really cool). Said god had a festival to which animals were offered unto it, and animals sacrificed. The name implies that the people the gun kills are in the name of the god, and they are a sacrifice to it.

1495118387,2017-05-18,"It was a 1v3, Juan did not have the upper hand, with no utility and the recent demoralisation from a teammate who had left the game for no reason halfway through the game, things would've seemed grim for us. Having gotten info from his teammate who died from a FUCKING FIVE SEVEN AT PLATFORM, he slyly manoeuvred his way through short and managed to pick off an awper in the head carelessly watching long. With an awp scoped onto the bomb planted for long from pit, a trusty deag as a sidearm we had hope to overcome the enemy and finally end this stress inducing 15-13 game. Alas, albeit Juan being our top frag and spot on aim, we had lost that round to a smoke, flashes, and an mp9 who came in from long. Amidst Juan cursing himself for being so careless, everyone had tried to cheer him up, and motivated our team for the final round, making sure the morale wasn't lost, and somehow in those 15 seconds, as the timer struck 0, Juan had managed to pick himself up, beckoning the words ""Alright team, vamos a hacerlo!"" As the round started and with all 4 of us spamming z + 4 to the bot who had a mac 10 in hand, whilst we were all fully equipped with ak's, utility and an awp, we were determined to end the game with a 16-14 score. That was, until our top frags Juan and Bob died to and insane wallbang from a ct awper through t base as Bob was just crossing behind Juan who was watching mid. Things quickly spiralled downwards for us, as 2 ct's rushed through mid and caught me off guard whilst Finn was shot from the back as he was rotating down from upper tunnels to help the blinded me. With Bob the only survivor on the bot with a mac 10, footsteps that could be heard coming from long,the ak and awp far from reach and the bomb stuck in lower tuns, all hope had seemed to be lost. Despite the odds, bob was not deterred, shortly after taking control over Bot Ivan, he quickly sprayed virtual into the back of the head of the backstabbing ct from upper tunnels, and retrieved the bomb from Finn's dead body. Things were far from over as footsteps could be heard coming behind him from upper tunnels as he was just a few steps more to the ak. Deciding to forfeit the ak he quickly turned around and was faced by an airborne ct, jumping down the stairs whilst holding his knife out, greedily trying to slash Bob down into a humiliating defeat. But thankfully for Bob, who had the mobility and power of the mac 10, he was able to evade the tip of the blade by a few mere pixels and managed to skilfully incapacitate the enemy. But it was too soon to celebrate, as he was struck by a nade directly at the base of his model, which had also bounced finn's ak back into middle. 54HP. Two rifle hits and the game would end in a draw. He quickly hid behind the box in lower tunnels after deducing that such a trajectory could only have come from a short, and took his flash out from the greedy ct's corpse. He popped the flash just as he heard the ct drop down from short and bravely ran while gunning the blinded ct, firing the mac 10's deadly spray of bullets into the enemy's face. What the three of us had just witnessed as spectators was nothing short of a miracle, and it reignited our hopes, but then we got a reality check as we looked down at the hud: 12. The ct must've sprayed out of panic and hit Bob with random shots. It was going to be tough, but at least we knew that he was facing an awp who could never get his hands on any rifles as their whole team had died out of their own greed which accompanied the mac10's prowess. All was far from over, as the awper had full health for all we knew, and bob had only a smoke and flash remaining as he scavenged the dead bodies. As he was going over them, we all stared through his model's eyes as he held his gaze onto the numerous ak's laid on the floor... the firepower it would give, the single precise headshot needed that would end the game in an awesome win, compared to the struggle of the mac 10 that had only 53 bullets left in its magazine and the glock as his only backup lest it failed. But Bob just walked past it... He ignored my point disarray, Juan's fire serpent that the ct had stolen and Finn's stat-trak fuel injector, all for the nameless vanilla mac 10 with its strap dangling down the butt, as if the 4 kills it had granted him were not seducing enough. And none of the three of us made a sound. It was as if we had all agreed that at that point, even if he had managed to land a once in a lifetime headshot through the wall onto the ct with an ak, the win would not be worth it. And we kept our silence. 45 seconds on the clock. After a slight pause, Bob threw a smoke up catwalk, following it was his final flash over mid doors. And he waited. He waited for the footsteps to cross ct spawn and ran to B site, and just as the timer ticked past 5 seconds he managed to get the bomb plant down. With no utility and the smg in hand he stayed on site. We all knew that a single well aimed nade would have ended him, but he stood his ground beside the blue barrels and decided to tempt fate. As the smoke came in, the flashes popped and an incendiary burning the inside of b site, every beep from the bomb further intensified our anxiety as we watched Bob flick left and right between window and door. And then it happened. Just as Bob was watching doors, the sound of a scope clicked from the left. And just like a tryndamere who had just ulted, he strafed left without hesitation, jumped up a box and prefired at the awper through window. Dink after dink, he stared down the barrel of the awper, who panicked and fired.
