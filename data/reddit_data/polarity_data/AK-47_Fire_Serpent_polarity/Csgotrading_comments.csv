1698624240.0,2023-10-30,Bro i think I know the market and how skins work :) but nothing wrong with what you say. But if you don’t have a float cap FN (0-0.07) is as rare as WW (0.38-0.45). But in case of the fire serpent it’s not cause of float cap at (0.06). in other cases where there is no float cap the #1 WW is as rare as #1 FN. MW is a bit less rarer since it has a range of (0.07-0.15).,0.071,0.865,0.064,-0.1454,1
