1405106213,2014-07-11,"My prediction is that the Serpent will rise and the Vulcan will drop. Fire Serpent is from the Bravo case, which has an incredibly small drop rate, which means that less cases are opened, which leads to less new Fire Serpents on the market. Vulcan, on the other hand, is from the Huntsman case, which has normal drop rates, which leads to more Vulcans being uncrated than Fire Serpents. It also comes down to which gun you like, but from looking at the market, his AK is worth more than both your AK and Nitro. EDI: Your Fire Serpent looks quite similar to mine. It has been PC'ed at 1-2 keys above market.",0.119,0.831,0.051,-0.6542,2

1405143607,2014-07-12,"Hi, I feel like alot of players don't understand the liquidity of items here. You need to look at volume and prices of items and then get a good idea of demand to trade for that item through csgolounge. Some items I have pinpointed as must haves: -AK fire serpents; These items are super high in demand and there is a limited number of them due to bravo being discontinued. Its really easy to sell a fire serpent for full price in keys, they look great to play with, and they will continue to be high in price. -Glock Fade. Glock items are always really high in price, and people LOVE fade patterns. New items will come out, they will be cool, but the glock fades will never be shocked in value very much by new items. Get a nice glock fade and it will always be your favorite item that will hold its value -Vanilla Knives. These are a bit more risky, as you never know how new knives will affect prices down the road. I don't see them moving +/- $10 max though, so this is a safe thing to invest in for the next 3-6 months. -Asiimovs. I really have no idea how much these are gonna get shocked. M4a4 asiimovs have dropped a bit now that there are other covert options, and I expect the same to happen with the next covert awp. However, these skins are cool and are definitely iconic CS:GO items now. They will always have some value, but it remains unclear with Phoenix/WinterOff cases still dropping. glhf",0.054,0.772,0.174,0.9874,4

Honestly, I've been trading around for a few months now almost hitting half a year, and i've seen ONE person sell a FN perfectly clean stattrak Fire serpent. Raising the price a ton just because it's one thing, but you also cannot count out completely the rarity of said object. Going back to your asiimov example, if you're perfectly fine with buying one from the market at a cheaper cost, but also ok with a spot or two, then go for it.

They're also commonly used in betting. So when they get discontinued the price is bound to rise. _________________________________________________________ The M4's will most likely also rise in price, even tho they're not as popular as howl's when it comes to having a skin.

Can I explain why randomly the prices are dipping so suddenly? Not really.. maybe because several weeks ago there was a huge rise in price. Howls, Fire Serpents, Glock Fades, Dragon Lores, and I'm sure a few other weapons saw a jump in price over the past couple weeks. The howl, fire serpent, and dragon lore were the most noticeable in price jump imo. Why? Demand is my guess. In the midst of all this rustle and hustle for these rising skin prices, they were bought up fast, people started demanding more and more for them and that's how the trend continued. So since time has passed and everyone has realized that, sure howls are rare but they aren't THAAAAAT rare, *yet*, I figure the price would dip a little. Of course this will start on the lower wears of the guns FT &amp; MW more so than the higher wears. All this being said, I think the Howl is just one of those things that isn't a bad thing to invest in. It will take time, maybe a lot of time, but it will be a good investment in the end. I just think it's ugly.

It is hard to say how much the market manipulation changed the market, it might even be on its natural price, im just speculating. But I want you to be aware that the behaviour of the howl is VERY unique, might be solely due to the contraband tag but I doubt that very much.

No. Of course it adds a price, but with the huge supply of the howl, sure it is decreasing as people get banned, they get forgotten in inventories etc, but its gonna take A LONG while and the supply will never ever get anywhere close to the one of the FN fire serpent. If you speak of a one of a kind, sure it is the one contraband and it is the best M4a4 skin there is now, aside from the estetic.

There are a few things keeping it up in the 250-300 eur range, these things was what held it up in the 250 key mark when it was there. 1. Contraband, its very unique. Only skin in game that has it and people recognise it and knows there wont be any more of them. 2. Confidence, the confidence of the FN howl was HUUUGE, the loss of majority of the confidence in the skin going to the moon was the main reason it went from 250 to where it is now. 3. Investing, it is a very suitable skin to invest in, you have a very safe investment that has no reason to go down below the natural (the non-manipulated price), besides if CS:GO goes dead.

1415307963,2014-11-06,"It depends. Variables that affect it are playercount (if playerbase has a strong upward trend, old/discontinued skins perform better), how many pros will use it in next major or two, whether valve decides to give unsilenced m4 a boost and how nice will be the m4 skins in next couple updates. There is also a veeeery unlikely possibility of old collections being reintroduced, which would life the price of howl. Generally, huntsman was introduced in 1st/2n May and howl got discontinued @ appr. 12th June. It's hard to make a plausible estimation, but given player dynamics I'd say that amount of howls is higher than that of fire serpents. The difference is that serpent is more actively traded, and a lot of howls are hoarded for speculative purposes. For bottom line, it's the end users that give value to a particular skin, not speculators. And since the price of howl had a rough ride, not too many new speculators will probably want to jump the wagon. So to finally answer the question: yes, IMO the price will go up eventually, assuming that the playerbase of CSGO keeps increasing (which it probably will). However, it will also go up for many older cases, older operation passes, Fire Serpent, boom, graphite and other legacy skins, and to a lesser extent of AWP redline/p250 mehndi. So if you like using howl, by all means keep it, I don't think prices will keep falling MUCH lower... If you only have it for investment/speculative purposes, go with your gut feeling, it might be a good or not that good investment, but it is still an investment grade item, unlike AWP asiimovs and stattrak cyrexes.",0.032,0.851,0.118,0.9733,1

1418026881,2014-12-08,"Couple of things - For example Dragon Lore: If it is scratchless, if will worth more like fire serpent - For Crimson Webs, Being all red makes it more valuable(again less scratch), for example, Karambits, If you have centered big web, this is the best, for bayonet or M9 bayo the more webs you have the more it will worth. - For Usps orion: Orange top worth more - For fade: glock: %33,33,33 is the best, also in all knives except karambit fade, yellow is bad (people prefer full faded for most knives, but for karambit, being pink and yellow is the best) And its calculated by its percentage. the higher the better. - For Night: Being scratchless is the only way. - For case hardeneds, actually it is not really about the blue (some people value it more of course) but it is mostly looking as a whole- I mean all gold, or all blue is worth a lot more than being mixed. - Also for knives, Black handle is worth more (like bayonet or M9 bayonet) - Slaughters have some patterns like Diamind, Angel, Heart.. and they add about 20-30 according to the knife, but mostly people overrate it. And personally I like Zebra one(the most regular one) If you have any specific one, Ill do my best to answer. **Edit:** A lot of people will try to use weird shapes or things to increase the value, never fall for them, always ask for trustable traders' opinion. For instance if you check lounge for Stattrak Fire serpent FT, you will NEVER see any FT looking one, everyone will say it is MW look. Never fall for that :)",0.042,0.789,0.169,0.9893,8

If you want to stick to skins, stick to AWP/M4/AK. I recommend the higher praised skins like vulcan and fire serpent rather than jaguar for example. Also, stick to good looking skins. Sure pick up WW or BS if its better than average. Avoid scratched up pieces of shit. Although they are expensive and can be top tier, they are harder sell and trade. As for knives, again avoid scratched knives. If you are after lower tier patterns (forest, scorched, etc) avoid flip and huntsman. People just dont like them as much for some reason.

1419629284,2014-12-26,"Another fellow posted something similar. Here's my comment, slightly edited. --- Stick to AWP/M4/AK. I recommend the higher praised skins like vulcan and fire serpent rather than jaguar for example. Also, stick to good looking skins. Pick up WW or BS if its better than average and looks truly FT+. Avoid scratched up pieces of shit. Nobody wants to drop money on something that looks bad. Although they are expensive and can be top tier, they are harder sell and trade. Only take scratched pos (pieces of shits) if you the deal is good enough to flip. As for knives, again avoid scratched knives. If you are after lower tier patterns (forest, scorched, etc) avoid flip and huntsman. People just dont like them as much for some reason. I recommend karambits if you are after lower tier patterns. Also avoid case hardened. They are probably the hardest patterns to sell. --- Some easily traded skins (and their stat trak counterparts follow): * Cyrex * Vulcan * Asiimovs * Fire serpent * Redlines * Master piece * dragon lore * howl * of course there are many others --- csgo.steamanalyst.com will be your savior. It provides the average price in USD and keys, trends (up/down/constant), and similar priced skins.",0.118,0.757,0.125,0.4215,2

Just a few days ago I made a list of skins I really want and after I got them I said to my self that it is enough of trading for now and that I will continue it later. I'm pretty proud of my self, I started from about 20 euros and finished at around 300+ euros and 2 days ago after I finished my collection I gave my other skins that I didn't need (including AK Fire Serpent) to my brother so he can get his dream knife one day too.

I would also recommend just sticking to your gut instinct as well. My rule for myself is, that if someone seems sketchy or gives me a bad vibe then I'll refuse to trade with them. I know you're looking for one lump-sum of a trade, but it might be better to trade for keys then sell the keys off. It's more work and tedious, but selling off keys in small increments is **wayyyyy** safer than selling off your entire inventory. Simply because if something were to happen and you did get scammed, would you rather be scammed of your entire inventory, or perhaps a small amount of keys like 10-20? Obviously a rhetorical question, but I hope you know what I mean :p Anyway, if you do decide feel free to hit me up.

Fortunately I only lost a fire serpent FT when it was $50 on market. And a quick tip: Always check which slot their knife is in their inventory, if it changes to one of the first ones when it was in one towards the bottom, they are most likely trying to quickswitch you.

1427868585,2015-04-01,"I would not worry about it. Here's why: If you look at the number of Bravo Classified STs sold in the rush, there's about 100. Even if all of these were to be traded, you would expect all of about 100/10/2=5 new Fire Serpents. Among Restricted guns, only Graven Mac-10s were bought in large numbers (about 200). We can just ignore the Mil-Specs. We're looking at around 6 Fire Serpents total*. This type of analysis seems to be vindicated by looking at other Reds: only a few have dropped price, and only slightly. Next up, we have to consider whether everyone actually traded up. It's probably not the case: trading up introduces a lot of risk, and because one can always trade up later, many people would rather hold the item and try to sell it for a profit rather than trade up. In fact, in normal conditions, weapons sell at a premium to their trade-up value. It's like money in the bank: the fact that you *could* withdraw it gives it value, without you having to actually withdraw it. So it's probably better to wait for normal conditions to reassert themselves, and resell the items for an even greater profit, unless you need the money *now*, because you wanted to repeat the arbitrage. However, a fast arbitrageur would have focused their efforts on some other collection so that they wouldn't have to wait 7 days. The logical concern to this is that the very fact that people are panicking, especially for an unlisted item, will drive the price down. I can't say for certain this won't be the case, but if we were to use the Dragon Lore as an example, it has managed to go up in price even during Vanguard in which supply of Cobblestone guns has increased. So in conclusion, don't panic. *There are more guns lying around in peoples' inventories, but by the time they get around to finding their windfall, they will be even less motivated to trade-up, for the reasons I've outlined.",0.057,0.861,0.082,0.786,3

Did the Knight go down in price? The answer my friends, is no. Why is that? short answer = The m4a1-s Knight is the popular gun. Not the skins it traded up from. Knight prices stayed high and the Deagle hand cannons went up. Guys the best advice i can give you on any trade or price check is an item is generally worth what people are willing to pay. Obviously if people are selling it cheaper people are willing to pay less but people are ONLY going to put it up cheaper if theres already good profit trading up. Like for ST Orions or fire serpents.

Anyway, clever choice to sell NOW but it was more clever selling before all this shit happen. Your mistake i believe is that you ask the sky for it. Ofc maybe there people that dont care throwing 15,000$ down the drain and taking this huge risk having seen what is going on now with Valve... 1) We have Valve beeing unpredictable when coming to patches/updates. The last victims were all FN rare drops from maps (R.I.P: Modern Hunter/Nuclear threat etc). 2) The recent patch/update which decreased ST weapons value by 25-30% such as ST FN Vulcans or ST MW Fire serpent, ST FN Orion and many many other skins in less than a week... 3) We have no idea whether they going to introduce a ST tag or drop again the bravo case (both examples happened in Dota2 which leaded for the skins prices to drop). 4) In general we all can see that Valve is trying to bring the majority of black market back to Steam market, where Valve and Steam can get comission, which means that they trying to find ways for expensive skins to fall in price.. So my opinion is that is not a reasonable B/O for this AK, the risk that someone takes for investing so much is ridiculous high and that you could sell it faster and easier if you were not so greedy and i believe without even posting this threat in reddit...

What can you do to ensure somehow your value is to buy the old items , the chance of those to drop in price is smaller. Ex: m4a4 howl. ... will never drop again. Ak fire serpent .... it costs 6-7 euros to open a case :) Not so many people will open those, even if there are many on the market now .. its because of the sale ....Best way to mantain value is with rare items. I wouldnt even buy awp dragon lore ... because of volvo can add it to random drops, or increase the drop for it . Happened in dota alot! one day an item was 300 euros, next day the item was 40 ( scythe of vyse ) , and many other exemples.

I wonder tho: m4a1 bright water http://csgostash.com/skin/123/M4A1-S-Bright-Water if i take 10x bright water with .1 - .11 float value (best that skin has to offer) will this result in a factory new ocean foam/p90 emerald/graphite? it obviously works like that the other way around as you explained.,0.014,0.808,0.178,0.9545,1

Of course you could have lower floats if you want a lower float. **y=range * average + min** **y=(.76-.06)*(0.01428571428)+(.06)** **y=(.7)*(0.01428571428)+(.06)** **y=(.00999999999)+(.06)** **y=.06999999999**,0.127,0.832,0.041,-0.8402,1

1435498759,2015-06-28,"This is my opinion based on what I've seen, with some personal remarks. The +keys amount means on top of market price. I hardly ever comment on price check threads, but I like kato'14 holos (as you can tell by my [inventory](http://steamcommunity.com/id/masedurp/inventory/)) and you seem ok. fire serpent mw ( hellraisers katowice 2014 holo + headhunter foil): +3k over market. HR would add a little value, but not much since it's not a hugely popular sticker and doesn't look that great there. Also, even some Kato14 sticker lovers prefer not to put them on serpent AKs. However, iBP holos on serpents raise the value more than the usual amount. . awp redline St ft (LGB,3Dmax and hellraisers katowice 2014 holo): +4k over market. ST FT is a bit of an in-between offering. If I go FT, I'd prefer non-ST to pay lower overall. If I go ST, I'd want ST MW. Unless the stickers were so awesome that it didnt matter, but that's not the case here. . ak-47 Vulcan ST MW ( 2 x navi katowice 14 holo + 2x katowice 15 holo ): +10k-15k. Find the right buyer that likes NAVI Kato14 and this may sell at that price. Some of the nicer stickers on high value/demand skins increase the price more than on lower value skins. However, personally, I am turned off when low value stickers are added in areas that cover potential wear (either intentionally or unintentionally) as is the case here. . ak-47 CH MW #1 ( titan katowice 2014): +0k. It's a non-holo that doesn't look great, and that skin is the #1. Lowers the stature of having a MW #1. Personally, I'd immediately scratch the sticker off if I was using that nice rifle, looks better without it. I know people might calculate the value of the sticker and all that, but honestly it takes away from the nice look of the rifle. . m4a4 asiimov ft (titan + navi kato 14 holo): +20k-25k. Good stickers and nice placement on an m4, and combinations of 2+ nice stickers with good placement are much harder to find. Sticker colors look ok on the asiimov. . ak-47 redline st ft ( ibuypower + Hellraisers + Dignitas all 2014 holo): Skipped. Depends on the wear of the rifle, if it is MW look, and I can't see it from the screenshot. . ak-47 black lam mw (4x kato 14 holo including ibp): +35k. The ibp and HR look great on this rifle. The MS and Dig don't suck too much on it and complete the 4 sticker slots. Even though the Dig doesn't really fit in, that sticker is by itself nice looking, and anyways doesn't usually match the skin it's on well. . ak-47 redline ST MW 4 ibp 2014 non holo: Don't have an opinion, since I don't pay attention to non-holo ibp prices. . awp lightning strike (nip+titan katowice 2014) . desert eagle golden koi ST FN ( vp katowice 2014 + crown foil) . m4a4 asiimov ST ft (3 x crown foil + vigilance)",0.076,0.768,0.156,0.9935,7

This is just how an economy works (unless you have knowledge that is not publicly known). Every single comment in this thread is not a guarantee and should not be treated as one. Everyone defaults to saying oh yeah fire serpent will climb and howls will too. What if they introduce a new skin that's 100x cooler than the fire serpent as a substitute it will cause the fire serp to drop in value since there are formidable opponents keeping it from skyrocketing. Take the cyrex m4 for example. There weren't any other covert m4s at the time and none really could compete with it. As soon as a competitor emerged, boom it dropped hard. Totally different point that I remember discussing with someone before, sure fire serp cases are 5 bucks a pop or were back in the days when I cared to check. This means that the case will slowly vanish as it isn't dropping at a rate greater than how much it is being opened. The thing is everyone knows that and bought serps with that info in mind. Along with that, say I assign a random appreciation rate based on the lack of cases. Call it 10% a year (totally random), sure it will go +10% but when they release the 420dankscope ak it will drop 20% causing the 10% to merely lessen the wound. Here's my advice, play the short game. Flipping quicksales of popular items is the way to go, it's too easy for an ""investment"" to go wrong these days. Operations swing around and boom knight drops 150$, sure most speculate a climb yet it hasn't really shifted all that much despite the incentive to buy now. Chroma knives are dangerous as another chroma case is practically inevitable imo. (but wait chroma case 3, half-life 3, tf3, nvm ignore the last sentence never gonna have a chroma 3) Huntsman/Butterfly have been overlooked as investments but idk seems kinda weak imo despite the fact that i know hunstmanillas climbed a bit iirc. tl;dr nothing is a guarantee, shit happens",0.098,0.819,0.083,-0.4541,6

It made items worth 500-600 keys before go down to 100-120. Second was the stat-trak update which is the reason ST FN Fire Serpents aren't worth 10000 keys anymore and that literately all the covert st weps fell at-least 60% on market.

1438747228,2015-08-05,"Asiimovs fall under a small subset of market items that don't follow the 85% rule. The general rule for market items is that the key price for an item is the market price * .85/2.5. The reason being is that keys are only a transferred currency, equivalent to .85/2.5 dollars due to the steam tax. People selling items for keys wouldn't take less (shouldn't* I should say) because they can just sell it on the market and buy more keys than you're offering. People buying items with keys shouldn't pay more because they most likely acquired such keys by (1) selling items on market to pay for keys or (2) trading items for those keys at key price (self-fulfilling prophecy). But there are two types of skins that beat this rule: currency skins and ""in-demand"" skins. Currency skins are those that are used beyond their normal in-game usage. The most obvious currency skins are betting skins. Asiimovs, Vulcans, Cyrexes, and now the new max-bets are a currency in and of themselves; spent like money to bet on sites like CSGOLounge/CSGOJackpot. Another example are Field-Tested AK Redlines, which for some reason have 2:1 replaced keys as currency for some high-end traders. The other subset are in-demand skins, which for one reason or another net the seller near, full, or even above market value in keys. The reasons for these skins being higher value can vary, but the most common one is that they are new and are replacing former playskins. The most recent examples are the Icarus Fell (tends to sell 90-95% market) and the Fire Serpent (which has climbed up to ~95-100+% market). Either the value of the skin itself as a nice item or the likelihood of appreciation later is making them trump the normal 85% rule.",0.01,0.906,0.084,0.9688,5

Keys won't depreciate in price, so it's best to always keep keys instead of skins. If you're looking purely at profit, I would suggest using the keys to get a good deal on knives. Then either look to trade the knife for a higher amount of keys (which tbh, is quite impossible for low to mid tier knives), or you could find a downgrade w/ overpay in items which you would then turn the items into keys. Low to mid tier trading is quite cancerous due to the QS/QB 80% stuff, but once you get to high tier trading, it's much easier as there would always be people classifying a certain knife as their ""dream knife"", which somehow helps you to gain profit easier due to the high demand on the knife.

Think of being able to Demolish a 5 cent ST skin and add the ST to a Fire Serpent. Or imagine being able to break down a $5 Hot Rod MP5 and add it to a $2 M4 FN. Suddenly, very high end courierrs ( Dota 2 knives ) were common as shit. * They took away keys slowly in the next updates, offering only direct purchase. Keys were completely destroyed in July 2015. * Added 3 month trading ban on items unboxed/dropped. * Increased drop rate for most items. They did this to bring most of the economy under $400 cap. Think of Rubies that were $1000 suddenly on market for $100. The only expensive things in Dota 2 are now Baby Roshans ( which are earned in tournaments and don't drop for normal people, never did ) and legacy couriers ( really old ones that dropped a really low amount ).

Personally, considering I have had one before (just without the sticker and slightly better float) I'd try pricing it at 190-200k to start off with.

Always take profit even if its 1k and youre not sure if u can get more...eventually itll add up. I also got just bored and lazy recently so id would just search for play skins for cheap (that i knew i could potentially profit from) and when i got bored of them or someone sent me something i could profit from id sell it. I also got lucky in terms of i made some bad inventments the past few days, bought a .27 fire serpent for 70k on accident, somehow got 72 from it and then some guy sort of scammed me on lounge i paid 16k for an m4 asiimov w nip stickers...guy said it was .21 turned out to be .28, was able to sell it on market and get 17k. Both of those deals were my fault entirely tho. Each key counts and id say to legit profit from things, you should try to buy items over atleast 25-30k and knives over 40k cause anything under like 20 ppl just want 1-2 key off market and its like near impossible to find those deals like 14 for awp FT, 10k for vulcan FT etc. Also asking for overpay in skins on lounge for desired items works too. i got a flip doppler today for 52k and made 64k from 2 skins this guy offered me lol i was mind blown.

1451190502,2015-12-27,"Nah. Desirableness plays some part sure, but if we had as many bravo cases as phoenix you think bravo would still be $8? Phoenix easily has one of the most desired skins in the game, with the AWP Asiimov, but the case is cheap as hell in comparison. This is solely because of the humongous number of phoenix cases. These cases are getting expensive almost entirely because of their rarity. There was simply a tiny fraction of the player base who played and bought Bravo vs the people playing and buying operations now. You see that with the other cases as well. The CSGO case 1 and 2, the esports cases, etc. Those stopped dropping and only dropped when the game had a much lower player count and thus are on short supply. The bravo is on the shortest supply of all, as you had to buy the operation in addition to playing early on. Yea if the Fire Serpent was replaced with a shit skin the case would probably only be 1 or 2 dollars. But you could trade the fire serpents place with any decently cool skin such as Vulcan, Cyrex, Asiimov, and the case would still be at the same price it is now, and obviously that skin would be as rare as the current fire serpent is. However if a case doesn't have a single desirable skin such as CSGO Case 3, it does hurt it, but still even with garbage trier skins it is one of the more expensive cases because of its rarity. Luckily almost every single case has a desirable skin. I don't see how the argument could possibly be made that the quality of the skins is more responsible for the case prices than the quantity of the cases.",0.119,0.786,0.095,-0.8991,0

1453479208,2016-01-22,"80% used to be realistic back when i first started trading. If i can remember the market tax was 15%. so this was the norm. With lounge the meta/trends/norms/prices dont change/set in for a while. You can see this so obviously with mid-high tier items that have dropped in price but people on lounge havent adjusted yet. I remember a specific item a little while ago was the ST MW fire serpent after the whole ""tradeup formula"" was uncovered. The price before this was around 600 keys- ish each. On reddit it began to drop and it fell to around 400 keys. but on lounge the b/os still remained at 600 keys + for ages and ages afterwards. I bought one on reddit for 400k at the time and put it on lounge. I managed to sell it for 630k pure. Other examples are chroma knives. I remember when kara TTs still had b/os of 250-300 keys when they fell to 200 because lounge hadnt caught up yet. You can start to see little bits of lounge paying slightly higher prices than 80%, like 81-82.

1454404674,2016-02-02,Thx Mark. I will stop this discussion with him now. I had a M9 marble with a blue tip and 0.35 float before and downgraded it. I was just wondering if a purple tip adds or nobody wants that. I got another PC source now telling me this is a blue tip worth 215 and another one telling me that it is a red tip worth 210. Makes no sense to me cause in my world a red tip is worth more than blue but I got a range to work with now. I didn't looked up the fire serpent thread but a headhunter sticker adds a key if lucky two. Depending where it is positioned. The range marbles go with that float is way bigger all depending if the tip is in demand or not that is why I started a PC. I already mentioned I know the ranges for yellow blue and red tips (from research not by selling - I'm a really lazy asshole stealing the time of others) but was unsure about a purple one.,0.113,0.831,0.056,-0.8976,1

1454906144,2016-02-08,"&gt; Why? The amount of stickers. Especially if they are all the same stickers, they add more value (mostly quality over quantity though) This is circular logic. The fact that there are a number of stickers does not explain why having more stickers changes the ""10% rule"" (which, even if you say it is not, *is* in fact a rule *of practice*; it's a standard - an important one - that prevents sticker PCs from being arbitrary). You have to actually explain why it is that as you have more of the same ""valuable"" sticker, the value per-sticker increases. The answer: opportunity cost. Say I buy an AK Redline with an iBP Holo on the grip. You know what would go great with that iBP Holo? One... two... or three more! But you realize that to get those other three stickers, you have to pay full price per-sticker. You can't just buy an iBP Redline with a sticker in another spot and fuse them together some how. Because of that, the more of the ""desirable"" sticker(s) that you have on the gun, the more a buyer is/should be willing to pay per-sticker. By buying your gun, they're forgoing the opportunity cost of having to then buy the same sticker(s) and add them later. In other words, the more ""complete"" that a gun is in terms of the stickers you want on it, the more a buyer should be willing to pay since he doesn't have to make up what is lacking. ""Because you put four Crown Foils on this for me, I don't have to buy this other guy's Fire Serpent with two Crowns and also two individual stickers. As a result, I'm willing to pay more than the standard going rate since it saves me the opportunity cost otherwise.""",0.061,0.871,0.069,-0.1923,9

The Fire serpent its kinda hard because you have to take into consideration that its a really low FV, and the most expensive covert AK skin outhere, so I'd say around 20% of sticker price for that one (expensive, yes, but it suits the gun really well and its a really low FV one) Redline good FV, perfect placement, but its a Redline after all. There must be tons of those with Crown (popular skin at the time that the Crown was 5-10 bucks per sticker). Id say 10% for that one, but you can try to push it to 15% of sticker price cause its ST and has a great FV. M4A4: A really low amount of M4A4 with crowns exists, cause when the sticker was cheap 98% of the community (and pros) were using the A1. Its FN and MW. I'd say 15% of sticker price due to beign a covert rifle, ST and MW with good FV, also the placement in that one is perfect. To the people that might say ""omg such a higballer 10% sticker price and thats it"" just no. Sometimes when you want a play skin, you will have to pay more than that (my inventory is a proof of that thing). Hope it helped you, feel free to ask me anything. Disclaimer: My prices are made to sell this skins in a relatively quickly time. You can ask for 30% of sticker price, and if some collector like me is searching for that specific skin and can't find a cheaper one, he most likely will pay what you ask (I paid insane % for some of my skins because some of those were so fucking hard to get).

FN Howl's were going for 260 keys. Now, FN Fire Serpents are going for 300+ keys. FN Howl's are going for 400?+ keys. Prices change and as more and more people join the game and keep their play skins, there's a smaller supply. I know that for a 0.00 float Howl, that the owners are asking for 550+ keys.

M4A1-S Knight is just a clean skin on its own, nothing too fancy, and the Crown compliments its simplicity and color design well. HOWEVER, all I think is that fire serpent looks stupid. I mean, seriously. Now, you take that poor Fire Serpent, which the Crowns simply don't fit on, and put 4 of them all over it? Now, had you put like a single Headhunter on the wood, now that would be sexy. It fits the mayan theme of the gun, and doesn't take away from the gun's actual design. See, I personally have never bought too much into stickers. I will admit I've stickered a few of my guns, and usually it's to compliment the skin in some way. But I don't understand why stickers are getting all this hype. Simply put, I can't justify spending more than like $20 on something that loses 90% OR MORE of its value once I actually use it. Or what, am I supposed to just go inspect it in-game, tuck it to bed each night, and then eventually sell it off to someone who just wants to do the same thing? That's fucking weird. At least if I buy a knife, I can play with the knife in-game and then eventually re-sell it. I've just never understood this part of the trading community.

You must set a realistic price or a specific item for which you would instantly trade for every item you buy, sell, or trade here.

The thing is, they are expensive and thus discourage many to unbox them as the investment is higher than any other case, even if the possible outcome is higher as well.

It's going to hit some items much much worse than others (Redlines, Asiimovs, etc) but higher items will get hit as well. Howls, Fire Serpents, and DLores are definitely used for higher end betting.

I don't know where they'll end up, but I'm happy to minimize the downside by selling off my extra stuff.

Each of these factors has a different weight and impacts different types of items, but I don't see any of it leading up in prices. I think rubies/sapphires are mainly just going to be impacted by a change in playerbase, but most other skins are hit by all 4 factors. DLores, Fire Serpents, and Howls are pretty heavily used for gambling. Things like AWP Asiimovs I don't see used nearly often enough in games relative to the amount sold for them to maintain their price tag. Ruby/Sapphire prices could barely budge, or they could tank. That one depends on the confidence of all the traders hoarding 5+ Kara/M9/Bayo/Flip sapphires, rubies, and black pearls. If they start selling off their excess then prices could go back down to ~9 months ago, but I haven't seen too much of that yet.",0.026,0.892,0.082,0.8873,1

For collectors who want a high tier ak skin which is normally one of the main skins people want, its either a st fn fire serp which they all look the same or a very rare unique top blue gem.

1473907756,2016-09-15,"One of the things that really annoys me the most is when people all say they ""like"" a skin the most, when it just happens to be super duper expensive. A few months ago someone made a survey on this /r/ and the skins that got the most votes for ""favorite"" of a certain gun were exactly what you'd expect- Dragon Lore, Fire Serpent, etc. A lot of people don't really develop their own taste in skins- they just think of skins purely in monetary value (""Its worth a lot more money so it must be a better skin, right??""). The problem with that is rarity often trumps looks in terms of how expensive a skin is (principles of supply/demand) which is why a covert skin from a really old weapon case will usually be more expensive than a covert skin of the same gun in a newer case, despite looks. Tbh I like my $15 Wasteland Rebel more than a Fire Serpent, and if i wanted a fire-serpent looking skin then I would rather have the Aquamarine Revenge. And also, up until very recently I'd been playing with a stattrak ak elite build for a very very long time which was gr8 for me. I also think, however cool the body of a dragon lore looks, the scope's checkered pattern is too strange for me ($1000 for a weird christmas present-themed skin? wut) I'd rather use my $1 awp worm god because theres just something about the primarily white color that i really like when awping (kinda contrasts to all the dark textures in-game, including the gloves). But yes- there are a lot of extremely cheap skins that look quite nice- if you just research skins a lot you'll find some cool ones that aren't used a ton but are still affordable and look awesome, or ones that fit those criteria but *are* used a lot. Ex. Nova | Moon in Libra is like 20 cents and it looks super sick; Mac-10 | Malachite; P250 Supernova, etc. [This is all my opinion, everyone has the right to their own opinions on stuff I just thought I'd share some stuff I've noticed. Pls dont get triggered for me dissing the dragon lore, its nice looking and all but it's not really my type ;) ] . tl;dr - Like what you think looks good, not what's expensive.

1475128556,2016-09-29,"Firstly, yes I would take the offer as long as the Vulcan is definitely FN. Secondly, they arent all double the price, some are more than double (eg, Famas Spitfire, AK Fire Serpent), some are less than double (Dual Berettas Duelist, AWP Sun in Leo) , and some are even worth less in FN than in MW (P2000 Scorpion, AWP Graphite). Mainly it just comes down to rarity - the spitfire and fire serpent cap at 0.06 so they are rare to get in FN, making them much more valuable, the duelist and sun in leo are about as common as each other, and look much the same so are not worth that much more, while the scorpion and graphite are rarer in MW, and so are more expensive. It is also based on looks though, skins like the M4 Hot Rod, M4 atomic alloy and usp orion are all skins that wear easily, whereas skins like the G3 flux, Fuel injector skins and dual berettas dueling dragons are only brightness based, and so there isnt much difference between FN and BS. This also influences prices a lot. A 0.01 hot rod compared to a 0.001 is a massive price difference as it will be much cleaner, whereas a 0.01 ak fuel injector compared to a 0.001 a much smaller price gap, because the low float adds almost nothing to the skin. TL;DR : Prices are generally based off of rarity and looks, if the item is rarer or has a better look in FN it will be more expensive, and if it does not then it will have a much smaller price difference.",0.025,0.879,0.097,0.9538,7

1477921454,2016-10-31,"Hello iAmJustASmurf and thanks for your reply! Even tho I earlier mentioned that i'd not reply you back anymore, I still kinda want to try and clarify this once again. If I want to buy a skin from Steam market, I browse Steam market and see, that there's a skin I like for 50euro Steam money. I like the skin - fine, I pay 50euro Steam money for it. If I want to buy a skin from /r/GOTrade, I browse the subreddit and see that there's a Fire Serpent going for 265 keys. Thats fine - I can buy it for 265 keys which I already have in my inventory. But hey.. the 265 keys seems pretty high, since I can get one on OPskins for 400euros, and that means roughly 177 keys! Hmm, why should I pay 88 keys more to get the exact same skin?! That doesnt make any sense. Rather than selling my keys on opskins for real money and buy the skin with real money it must be a lot easier to say that ""the skin is X amount cheaper on opskins so I offer that amount on keys"". Which is just a fcking stupid thing to do, because: - Clearly OP doesnt care to get real money for that skin(ATM atleast). It kinda feels like he wants keys. - When paying with IRL money = paid amount is different than paying with virtual money **even tho u can easily convert your virtual money to real money**. If u have any more concerns about anything related to UYOBC (Using Your Own Brains Correctly), please, dont get back to me. Try to contact some other people who can help u.

1480131796,2016-11-26,"I definitely understand the rule, I just think it's silly that you're forced to specify float values when I couldn't care less about the float. Float value is almost entirely meaningless if you're looking to buy skins to play with and not to resell. The best example is with Karambits. If you can't specify cleanliness how do you buy a karambit with a clean corner on this subreddit? You could specify 0.000x float, sure, but there are loads of Karambits with 0.000x floats that have terrible corners. Meanwhile, there are flawless karambits that have 0.012 floats. Flawless sapphire/ruby karambits, of any float, are worth nearly double what a 0.00x with a crappy corner is worth. So even if you make an advertisement with a buyout that clearly warrants a flawless one (say, 1500 keys) you'd be forced to accept subpar karambits for enormous amounts of overpay. Another good example is Fire Serpent, a skin that can look terrible or quite literally flawless at the identical float of .08x If you can't specify cleanliness, you can't buy a fire serpent without opening yourself up to getting your keys scammed by somebody who offers a really shitty fire serpent that happens to have a low float. I'm definitely to abide by the trade rules this community has established, and I greatly respect the trading system built by you and the mod team - but I do feel that certain policies make trading items extremely difficult unless you only care about profit and not the actual quality of your skins. Perhaps in the future the moderators could open a discussion with the subreddit users about developing a system that allows more specification without deviating into clickbait territory. Perhaps allow users to offer a metjm of the skin they're looking to purchase and specify ""as clean or cleaner than the one pictured in this image"" I can sympathize with how annoying it is to send a buyout and be ignored, but that's not nearly as bad as getting ripped off for 100+ keys because you are forced to accept a crappy buyout just because their skin happens to match the float value you specify.

Getting as many items into a marketplace price is super beneficial to them. The cheaper items are the more likely it is to be tossed onto the market over and over. Not saying all items should be super cheap.. but keeping most items on the market is a smart move by them. Stattrak is inflated from its rarity not really its desirability.. Small example on why this idea might ever happen. Lets say there are 50k Fire serpents and 5k stattrak Fire serpents. Those 5k Fire Serpents arent insanely desired because they count kills.. they are desired because they are rarer and a tier higher.. if you add the stattrak kit all guns get the ability to be a tier higher thus removing that rare bracket. We would then have 55k Fire Serpents and all of them would come down. The Average price would probably top out at $400 for a FN FS.. more for .00 floats.

First I tried to remember what the last one was on reddit for about 3-5 weeks ago roughly which was 1300 keys I believe. This together with the fact that a Stat Trak Ak-47 Fire Serpent FN sold for 2749$ on Opskins yesterday [evidence](https://opskins.com/?loc=shop_view_item&amp;item=59454346) and the last ones in December selling for 2250-2750 (the 2250 was a real quicksell imo so we shouldnt count that one) So I would say the 2749$ which it sold yesterday for is the price we should go for here. Considering there is a 5% fee on Opskins the guy got 2749$ x 0,95 for it = 2611,55$. Now the only other thing we need to calculate is for how much you could sell the keys on Opskins which is atm about 2,25$x0,95 = 2,13-2,14 per Key. 2611,55$:2,13 = **1226 Keys** You should **not** let it go for anything less than that.

Sold the panther along a scar field tested I purchased for 700 keys from my friend specifically for this trade and topped it with 50-75 keys (forgot how much) for a #3/4 duped M9 CW FN. A few days later I traded that #3/4 duped M9 CW FN for a Triple Web non duped M9 CW FN along with a bayonet emerald I sold for 450 pure. I then traded that M9 CW FN triple webbed non duped + a kara 90/10 fade (250k) for the 4x IBP Holo MW fire serpent a day or so later. Then about 2 days after I sold the serpent for a sara haire ww + st mw blue laminate 4x tt holo 800k + 50k. A day later sold the sara haire ww for about 3000 keys resell value items. So I basically moved 1250k -&gt; 3000k resell from sara haire + st mw blue lam 4x tt holo 800 + 50 pure + (450k - 250 (bayo emerald pure sell price - kara fade price used to upgrade m9 cw triple web to serp) = Totaled like 2800 keys in a span of a little bit more then a week.

I don't list a lot of the stuff on reddit though since I mainly just trade through friends. I guess in order to sell items like that you'd have to have a decent amount of friends and connections cause I'd often be contacted to purchase certain blue gem karambits for clients willing to pay a certain amount, and most if not all of these items were bought by friends contacting me because they a certain item in my inventory.",0.042,0.85,0.108,0.9686,1

1483937256,2017-01-09,"I just recently got back to trading, i'm still on my way of selling everything (i kept after cashing out) to get keys &amp; start again. I've been trading from uhhh i'd say oct 2015 to march 2016 ? starting with something between 100 &amp; 150€ I endedup cashing out ~2000€ (after fee, from opskins &amp; paypal) &amp; keeping my actual inventory (so about 300 keys? was more like 400 but everything went down at some point apparently) ------------------------------------------------ So, i have some stuff to say. Someone on this thread said it comes to luck &amp; timing, hes talking about investing but i think its ""somewhat"" true for normal trading. It all depend to the time you invest on trading. If you trade half a day you'll have more change to find lucky trade were you're gonna do good profit, if you only trade one hour after your work then sure, you're going to do less profit, its going to be pretty slow at first etc. But then you still can be lucky he, just that the chances are lower. People tends to say ""Analize the market"" ""Find your niche"" etc, while it might works for them, i think it is not necessary. * First thing, avoid CH. Yes somes people makes crazy profit out of them, yes once you know them its probably profitable, but its still risky, takes a long time to trade, and you should not do it until you have enough spare money(keys or whatever) to keep trading while you wait for your bluegem thing to get decent offers. * Try avoiding ST knives, but keep an eye on what could be really profitable, don't totally ignore them, Unless its cancer. * Don't hesitate to speak with people, don't go all ""DON'T ADD ME ONLY STEAM OFFER"". Once again, some people might say it works for them that way, but i'm talking about my own experience and since i believe i've done not bad, you could give a shot doing that way. * Use Reddit, Lounge mostly. Steam forums worked well sometimes for me. Trading server &amp; Facebook never really worked for me so i can't tell. * Find the right words when making your posts, don't be too short, don't be too long, give all the informations, be clear, give screenshots (good if possible). * Think about efficiency : If you, lets say, try to sell an item that you bought 95k for 100k, gets no offer within 3days other than a 98k offer, think about it. Cause if you take it, you still make a 3k profit, and if you don't, there's a possibility that you wait 3 more days or even more. Sure there's a possibility that you get a better offer quickly, that's why i said, think about it, not ""take it!"". Cause if you accept that offer, you can buy another 95k item that you could sell for 98k again quickly &amp; you end up with a better profit. And its still true with 500k items, the marging is just different. * While i said that you don't need a niche or something, try staying around popular stuff. Doppler, Marble fade, Tiger Tooth, Fade, Fire Serpents, Lore, Howl, etc. Sure CW &amp; Slaughters works, but its still slower than theses (Or at least it was when i was trading). * Don't hesitate to play ""small"". You can be looking for some expensive item to buy &amp; resell while still doing trading with stuff like vulcan, asiimovs, vanilla knives, etc. It adds up pretty fast. * Be accomodating. If you face someone that really wants what you have, have half of the keys &amp; say ""i can add skins"", why not? take a look to his offer, and if he's slow, incertain, etc, do the work yourself, look at the price &amp; make an offer. ------------------------------------------------ * When i was doing that kind of stuff &amp; endedup with 10 goddamn items, i was doing 2 things : Either i went to use BOT Elma &amp; its friends to make it to something bigger/get better floats/etc, or, if i kept enough marging for my tastes, i sold them for slightly cheaper than other people here on reddit to sell them quickly, get my keys back, &amp; go on trading again. * As someone said on this post, know your prices &amp; be friendly, that's truly important. * And do researchs here on reddit when you're not sure about some prices. * And yes, as far as people dislike them, you can make theses ""buy this knife for XXX keys"" posts on lounge where you list every knives &amp; so. Just be realistic with the prices, don't be super greedy asking for very small % or something. ------------------------------------------------ Little exemple, when Kara TT were 200-210 keys, i used to pay 197-198 on lounge, and it worked. Sometimes for 1k profit, sometimes for 10, but since theses were really easy to trade, not a problem to get small profit. Then hunt good offers yourself, once you get to higher values such as rubies or fire &amp; ice knives, don't wait for them to come to you, search on lounge, again &amp; again, keep &amp; eye on the ""New"" Tab on this subreddit, etc. Cause yes, the big value items are very good, if you're going to quickly do 1-10k profit with sub200k items, theses 400+ items can bring you 30-100k a trade (yep, it happens) I hope you got some answers &amp; it helped you, sorry for my english, i'm tired, its late, &amp; english isn't my first language. ------------------------------------------------ EDIT : **Holy fucking shit i made this so long, i'm sorry**",0.052,0.773,0.175,0.9992,36

The Waste Land rebel is in the Vanguard case which is opened less than most of the main stream cases (Chroma &amp; Gamma) but it still probably opened more than bravo case so theoretically since there is less Waste Land Rebel's ST FN than the ST Fire Serpent FN and the case with the ST FN Waste Land rebels is opened more its probably a good idea to say that it's the rarest AK to get in ST FN since the chances would be lower to get one versus a ST FN Fire Serpent.

The reason I push this idea to the traders on Reddit is because many (I hope) traders on Reddit are here to exchange cosmetic items that they enjoy trading and not just looking to make 25% profit on every trade. I feel having more accessible prices from the mentioned steps would allow for people to compete around a known price range (as seen with Asiimovs, Vanillas, Fire Serpents etc.) based on how fast they want to sell and the difference between their item and a generic one.

You must set a realistic price or an item for which you would instantly trade for every item you buy, sell, or trade here. For items that won't be traded one-to-one, you must set a specific number (i.e. 60 keys, $45 PayPal). You may still ask for offers. If you are selling a number of items, you may set a bulk buyout for all of them. If you have set a buyout and your post is still being removed, please resubmit with a different title. New items added to the game won't require such a price (therefore you can ask for offers in this case), but only until one week after the first set of those items become tradable (CST/CDT will be the time zone used to determine when this window ends).

1490283469,2017-03-23,Because for MW dopplers there is a maximum float cap similar to how the fire serpent works. For the fire serpent the best float you can get is a 0.060000000xxx. Because it's capped at 0.06 it's really hard to get a factory new one. The MW doppler's and other skins such as fade's and tiger tooth's are like this too. As stated from the diagram on CS:GO Stash (https://csgostash.com/skin/542/M9-Bayonet-Doppler) you can see that the max highest float for a MW Doppler is 0.08 which means the only floats you can get MW Dopplers in are 0.07-0.08 which is a very small gap making the MW dopplers more rare.

1491222781,2017-04-03,"Okay, So I was around for the 3 spirits update that did infact fuck our shit up in the DotA 2 Economy. Due to rapid customization. So you are very wrong on that. All special couriers simply tanked in price because you could break a shitty courier for its good gems (effects) and place them into a good courier with shitty gems. So you are conveniently leaving this tid bit out. Which devistated the courier market which would be relatable to the knife market here as its something you take with you in every game regardless of heroes picked or guns bought. Furthermore, valve doesnt give a single fuck about traders, they will do what will make them the most money, which is why I am surprised that they havent fucked all our shit up in the first place. But personally as a trader that trades for things I want.. I hope they do fuck all our shit up like they did to DotA. But i doubt they will give things gems or have the ability to swap paints and finishes from knives off.. But here are the things I do expect in the next year because they would literally print money for valve. stattrak kits. $5.99 for 3 uses. (They don't give a single fuck about your ST Fire Serpent that is never seen on the market) Knife stattrak kits for $9.99 one use. (They Don't Give a fuck about your ST Doppler that is never seen on the market) Paint kits that divides the wear value by 1.5 $9.99 3 uses (so a .17 float item would become .11) [i feel dirty suggesting this]. (Why not make more FN Fire Serpents so they are seen on the market for say $30 instead of $400) Steel wool kit that multiplies the wear values by 1.5 $9.99 3 uses. (Some people prefer super battle scared items, why not give it to them) Again, They don't care about you. They care about the market, and in game purchases. They wont remove the keys like they did in DotA though.. people have already found the Chinese versions of the bloodhound key.. They won't change it so there are no duplicates, they will just show us the percents and that will be good enough for the Chinese Government and it will be a good enough tweak to the market. With the introduction of a new market they will want to saturate the items, increasing the price of already expensive items does not help valve at all. They want fire serpents, and other expensive items on the market, they want the cut, they just don't want the key price from you. They will want that transaction amount, and the best way to do this is to saturate the market a little by making cases have better odds. At first I speculate items will spike quite high.. but with new odds - more high end items will be unlocked and they will go back down (which may take like 6-12 months) but that's what I would bet on.

You must set a realistic price or an item for which you would instantly trade for every item you buy, sell, or trade here. For items that won't be traded one-to-one, you must set a specific number (i.e. 60 keys, $45 PayPal). You may still ask for offers. If you are selling a number of items, you may set a bulk buyout for all of them. If you have set a buyout and your post is still being removed, please resubmit with a different title. New items added to the game won't require such a price (therefore you can ask for offers in this case), but only until one week after the first set of those items become tradable (CST/CDT will be the time zone used to determine when this window ends).

Most notable example, the ft fire serpent was @ 85k right before the new case dropped, and it went all the way down to 75k a few days ago (although admittedly it's gone back up since). Also, the m9 doppler prices, an average float p2 qs was ~106k before the new case, while now it's a few keys lower.

1499018176,2017-07-02,"People already got the first four covered pretty well, but I think I can still contribute to 5. People will try to scam you in MANY different ways here. You probably know this from dota trading by now, but never trade for anything in which you do not receive everything you want in the trade window. No such thing as fake items, no reason to ever trade it anywhere to ""check"" it. Items can be inspected on metjm.net without owning them. Low floats can add value, but usually only if it is a very low float. They will not raise the price a ridiculous amount unless it is a super high tier item and one of the lowest existing floats. Some rare and valuable skins like dragon lores, fire serpents, etc do actually have different prices depending on the float even within the same wear condition, but those are much clearer because they are priced in a wide range to begin with. With dopplers, there is no such thing as a ""fake black pearl/sapphire"", there are simply phase 1/4 that have lots of black/blue. Those tend to sell for a few keys above price, but a max blue p4 is worth nowhere near a sapphire. Stattrak knives are usually hard to sell and almost always have manipulated prices. Check the steam market listings, steam market sales, and then go on to steamanalyst, opskins, etc to confirm that those are accurate before making a decision. Probably forgot to mention a few things and some people might have already said some of it before me, but I hope this helps anyway! EDIT: Oh yeah, and the *majority* of stickers will not add any significant value to skins. There are stickers worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars, but they are usually only worth a small percentage of that when applied on a skin. Don't let anybody tell you that their p250 sand dune with a 2014 ibp kato holo is worth 800 keys. Certain skins which fit the stickers well and have good placement can gain a good portion of the value, but it will never be above 50% afaik. The main stickers that ever add anything are crown foils, katowice 2014 tournament ones, and howling dawns.",0.095,0.743,0.163,0.9808,1

You must set a realistic price or an item for which you would instantly trade for every item you buy, sell, or trade here. For items that won't be traded one-to-one, you must set a specific number (i.e. 60 keys, $45 PayPal). You may still ask for offers. If you are selling a number of items, you may set a bulk buyout for all of them. If you have set a buyout and your post is still being removed, please resubmit with a different title. New items added to the game won't require such a price (therefore you can ask for offers in this case), but only until one week after the first set of those items become tradable (CST/CDT will be the time zone used to determine when this window ends). If you were trying to do this, and you feel this removal was an error, please contact us at the link given below after this message.

1515234504,2018-01-06,"1) Well, i used to play a game called Infestation Survivor Stories... i was really good at it, but at some point the game fall, and i manage to sell my ACC for an AK-47 Vulcan (2014). I didnt even know what was trading until a friend told me, ""why dont you trade this AK on lounge to get some othe skins you like"", i like the idea, and that how i figure out how many people trading with keys, and some of than paying 85% market, other 80%... anyway, when i saw this i think with my self. I can do this either. I start by selling my AK-47 for 28 keys. After i sold it, i had no clue if i did a good deal or not, i just run on lounge and tried to find an AK for 27 keys... after some searchs, i did it, grab another AK for 27, and thats how i start. After that, i pick up some Fire Serpents, some knives (get fucked a lot by picking up cancer items and spend the night trying to find a buyer haha)... Anyway when i saw, about a ~month i had a 400$ worth inventory, and decide to really do this for the rest of my life (i guess haha)... so here i'm, 2018, and im still doing it... 4 years :). 2) Well, its working for me, i face it like a real job, spent all my day doing it... im from a third world country btw, but, even first world, i think i can make a decent wage. I dont recommend to anyone either to do as a full time like me, but i do it, couz its 4 years of knowledge, so i kind know all the market completely ... Also, if you spent 4 years studying, you can get a better job than me haha... 3) About 75$ (worth of AK Vulcan that time...). Highest 4500$ on inventory (i cash out before it gets to big, not worth it and i need to live haha)... Lowest was when i started... never had less than that 4) Trading its a maginific way of making money, you stay sit on your computer, doesnt have to answer to people and lower your head to them... You just cant expect to make enough money to run yourself forever, i do because i live with my family, and we split the bills, so i kind had the 4 years to learn without having any conserning about money.",0.063,0.823,0.114,0.9626,1

Most case openings are actually from the free ""common"" case drops you get from playing CS:GO, so most cases are free. As an example, the reason the Operation Bravo case is so expensive is because it contains the very expensive and popular Fire Serpent, and the key required to open this case is the vanilla case key, which opens at least 3 other cases as well (I think). So people are much more willing to risk $10+ on a case at a chance for a desirable, expensive skin. The Hydra case on the other hand doesn't really have anything too expensive or desirable in it. Because of this, people don't want to invest into opening these cases, and hence there was (and still is) an oversupply of hydra keys in the market (just take a look at OPSkins... most key listings are for hydras). Now, because there is a massive supply of Hydra keys, trade bots started to value them less than other key types (up to 15-20 cents less on some sites). This is the main reason that people don't want to accept hydra keys in trades, because they cant get as much out of them from trading bots. Also for those that want to cash out, sites like OPSkins bought them for less (when they had the instant sell feature), and if you have 1000 keys you want to cash out for example, even 5-10 cents less per key means $50-100 less you could get from cashing out.

1525644985,2018-05-06,"Not sure whether you mean price wise or visually, but the answer to both is honestly that it depends on a case by case basis. Ultimately whether a skin gets overpay for a low float depends on if there is anybody out there willing to overpay for that float on that skin. Some skins are good at a certain point just because of trade-up potential, so those will always be in relatively high demand. I can't think of an example where anything below average (i.e on a regular FN skin, above .035) gets any form of overpay for the float. Higher-tiers like dragon lores, doppler gems, etc can pretty much gain value for every tiny increment, so that there is a noticeable price difference between .02 and .019 and a bigger difference between .019 and .018. Popular and somewhat rare skins like hyper beasts, empress, etc can still easily get overpay for .02, .01, etc. Low-tiers like random case blues will often be market price at .00x unless like stated above they are good for trade-ups. The top few floats for any skin are always worth a good bit regardless of any other factors, but can skyrocket up to ridiculous amounts if there are other factors involved, like good corner, good pattern, lots of blue, etc. In my experience, people care far less about skins with unusual caps like .10, .12, etc. .06 is usually tied to older skins that are already rare (like CW, bulldozer, fire serpent, etc) as well as more recently gloves, so around .060x they can still tend to fetch good prices. It also seems like popularity of a skin seems to be far more important than the looks, but generally you will still get a better price on a low float for something that looks like trash in higher floats. A good example would be awp asiimovs, even in .3 they pretty much all look identically clean but still are worth a good bit close to the float cap. On the other hand (no pun intended), the new gloves are incredibly scratched up in higher floats and fetch ridiculous prices in .07x, .15x, etc. The float spread of a skin also affects its price. For example, the SSG acid fade only goes between 0 and .03, so there are tons of .00x. The only reason it gets its value is because it is a cheap low-float solution for trade-ups with a single outcome. If the acid fade traded up to three purples instead of one, it would probably take .0000x to get any overpay. Sorry it's so long, and probably half of this was already said by others in the time it took to write it, but I've really been invested into floats for the past months so hopefully this helps out",0.035,0.721,0.244,0.999,10

As you surely know, Karambits, M9's and Butterfly Sapphires are currently priced rather low on cs.money , which is the reason why you almost never see them on the website since the opskins scandal. The skins they've had in their inventory at the moment, such as Karambit Emerald, or ST FN Fire Serpent remained at inflated prices and you can see a lot of , while the skins they haven't had many of at the time they decreased a lot so they can amortize their losses on the inflated ones. Using your logic, we can determine that cs.money is currently paying 701k for an M9 Sapphire FN, offer 745 and claim its an amazing deal and better get it fast, while you certainly know even the cash QS ones go for 785+ or 800+ on reddit. Or, calculate that cs.money is currently paying 922k for a Butterfly Sapphire and offer 970, once again presenting it as a great offer that one better take, while the cheapest one in cash would currently go for 1080k.

The problem is now it isn 2-3 days but 7-8, don’t let that deter you, trading is a great hobby of mine and along with expanding my inventory I’ve enjoyed the whole thing, as every since I played roblox when I was like 10 I was looking for a game to rival the trading scene they had there. Anyway, I’d definitely say that crowns and low floats is an avenue you should follow up on, as well as maybe Kato 14 Holo skins around that price. When you get to higher tier (e.g 200 keys) I’d recommend buying knives and special pattern/floated stuff (bayo ffi is within your current price range, always a great earner for me) as well as karambit fades and marble fades are decent if you know what to look for You could look at ch but idk anything about that Another important thing I’ve found is having a network of good friends within the scene who can pc something for you, a Kato Guy, a crown guy, low float and general knives, along with ch. this really helps when you’re looking to buy stuff but don’t really know too much about it.

1538840877,2018-10-06,"Eh, maybe. The problem is that there is now an easy to find baseline price on cs.money and bitskins, so at most, you can only make profit within the 5% tax that it has (since if you exceed 5% off the price of their skin, they can just use the site to get the skin at a lower price). Also, you can't always have highly desirable items if you trade them away, and people are not willing to overpay that percentage for cheap skins if they don't want to play with them or don't want them for their tradability. Highly desirable kato skins are a decent route since they are usually worth more than what cs.money gives for them, and you might actually get offers for these above what they are worth since there's not a set price anywhere for them. There are not that many highly desirable katos, though: avoid mixed katos and non holo katos. An AK Redline 0.15 with an IBP holo on the wood is a good example a desirable kato. Crowned items can also be good to trade, but again, be sure that they're easy to trade or on a nice skin or else you'll be stuck with them. A crown on the wood of a clean AK redline or low float FT fire serpent are good. Blackiimovs with crowns on the scope are also easy to trade, and the good thing about all these items is that there is some freedom with trading them since there's no set in stone price for good katos/crowns anywhere. So maybe you could. Another good way to do it would be to have a ""store"" of items: a variety of highly desirable knives between $200 and $600 each, and post it to this sub regularly. People will send you offers for these skins and you might be able to make some profit on them - the challenge to this idea would be to getting the items that you receive in trades back to a desirable skin: you would likely have to overpay to get someone to accept cheap knives for a desirable knife, so I would stay away from accepting any knife that is too hard to trade or below $200 for this reason if you do decide to follow this strategy. If you are wondering if a skin is highly desirable / not desirable or examples of these, feel free to ask me, since I've owned every knife and skin in the game multiple times and know how trading is with all of them.

1548677473,2019-01-28,"There are a lot of things to consider, starting from the skin itself, to other stuff. Most skins have their corresponding guide so that you can learn the best patterns to look for, for example [Dopplers](https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/350543389016646769/), marble fades ([Fire and ice](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=675516392)), [case hardeneds](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=389453686).. (there's also one [dedicated to AK-47's](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=380042859)) THen you have Crimson webs where the look itself (wear placement) + presence, number and positioning of the webs gives the value of the item. There are some other skins where you can find rare patterns (Glock moonlight with centered star for example) but I don't think there's that much demand to make them worth considerably more. There are guides for fades ([Karambit here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=486377298)) as well. Here's a [more general guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=247406953) which covers most of the popular pattern knives and skin. Suggest you give this a good read. Other than that, it's all about having a skin which looks cleaner than the others when used/inspected in game. For example, an [AK-47 Fire serpent with cleaner leg than another](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/923672665750978039/D2EFDF45753FE852CB947584137BBCA3274473C1/) with same/similar float can be worth quite a few keys more when trading it. Especially if someone is looking for a playskin or a skin to do crafts on it. The one in the screenshot is a 0.15x float which looks better than many Minimal wear ones, for instance. It doesn't have that much market but I am a big fan of the Fire serpent myself so I was really happy to find that specific one. USP-S orions are worth a lot of money if they combine good float (at least 0.00x I guess) + clean top, which is super rare to find, and makes the skin look way better than a beat up one (because the top on an Orion is orange, and if it's worn it shows the black under the paint, so people want clean top ones). Also those skins that are worth a lot more in FN condition than their higher wear counterparts (MW, FT etc) is because their float is capped, usually to 0.06, which gives a tiny range of chance of unboxing a FN one (or trading up to one) hence why it is way more valuable. There's a lot more to know based on which skin you look at (Karambits need clean corners, M9's are worth more if they have clean holes or spines, M4A4's with clean magazines or backs are worth more, etc etc), if you need more informations, I guess YouTube or Google may help you find all the information you need.",0.026,0.763,0.211,0.9979,57

Arguably you can expect to sell for more than 5% sticker price because there aren't a heap of vox holo fire serpents out there, and none that I know of are currently being actively advertised for sale. On top of this, the sticker is in the best position. Where you land in terms of the sticker price percentage really comes down to how quickly you want to sell it. You might get a sale at 10%sp+ak mp if youre willing to wait for the right buyer. I personally bought my fs .18 w vox holo on wood for approx $260, which i think was closer to 5% of sp at the time. I probably wouldnt sell mine for less than $400.00, but then again, I don't want to sell it. I recently had an unsolicited offer of $350 for a fn hot rod aug w ibp holo on front position, that I had bought for like $190, and I turned that down.

Thinking of it sometimes how I learned (kind of) the market of these kato14 skins. What got me into this was that I sat with my friend in a classroom, and I asked, if u could build ur dream loadout, how would it look? He answered and asked me, I mentioned the Fire Serpent, Asiimov, and some more skins I cant remember. I later asked myself how I was gonna accomplish this, Im 14, basically no income, Im just adding 20-30 euros a year into my steam wallet, it would take me ages to get my dream loadout. So after that I'd usually immidiatly get on my computer when I got home from school, and instead of playing, I'd sit on lounge (same site as U mentioned). After that I heard of Reddit and then I was able to make more profit, but also buy in skins. I did not make a ton of cash tbh, but it was fun, I enjoyed it. My name got a bit ""bigger"" since I was posting frequently and had a ton of friend-requests asking me for PC's. After a while I decided (at that time) to take a fee of a key or two. Since people I sometimes had asked before about PC's, they would ask for a fee from me. &amp;#x200B; I also decided to level my steam account, paid someone to make steam artwork for me and so on. Just to make my profile look more ""proffessional"". (Which I believe can get u more customers, but also, u look more like u know about csgo skins in general, IN MY CASE). &amp;#x200B; I've been kind of unlucky a few times. I remember sitting the day before the M4 Howl was getting a change (Had no idea about the change), reflecting whether I should get myself a Asiimov or Howl, ofc I went for the Asiimov. I also remember the time Dlores came. Sitting there seeing FTs going for 170 euros on market. I was thinking, ""Its new, it will for sure drop down, I really want it, but Ill lose cash if I buy it now. Seeing it going up daily in price, I still had that mindset, untill I then eventually couldnt afford it anymore. I recently went through my trade-history, and saw I had Howl MW once, and Howl FN once. &amp;#x200B; I really miss those days, going to school and just thinking what a good price for my skin would be to list it up and still maximize my profit. Then later on the day sitting on reddit and just hitting the refresh button all the time untill something interessting pops up. I did not make anywhere close to yours, I havnt checked the spec for ur computer, but I assume you prob made a profit of 2k dollars in total? I myself made 500dollars in total I believe, might have been 2-300 more, I cashed out 3-4 times and cant remember the exact numbers. Also, if I just saved some skins I traded with before (kato14 skins), damn I would make a HUUUUGE profit selling it today. &amp;#x200B; If u reading this would like to see my old-kato14 skins I once owned, check my profile and go to screenshoots. Sadly I did not take ss of all my skins, but theres still a ton of them there. Thanks for reading this, and sorry if its messy or way to long. :)",0.055,0.829,0.117,0.9924,10

1666461075,2022-10-22,"**All of the following are my personal opinions and I try to explain how I'd make that choice If I were you. I AM NO EXPERT** The main thing about the fire serpent being it's float distribution, which makes FN incredibly rare to get out of a case (and almost as hard to get from a trade up). FT is expensive and there is barely any influx of new ones due to the price of the case. The fire serpent isn't an incredibly looking skin either. Its liked for the prestige and for nostalgia (imo). There are newer and prettier AK skins in a similar price range. Vote: Wouldn't be **my** personal choice. Glock Fade is relatively stable and price has increased barely (+800RMB since I bought mine in early 2021), the main selling point is fade percentage and float. Similar to the Serpent no new ones enter the market, since the trade up skins are incredibly expensive. Cool looking skin tho. Vote: Imo, safe bet. Not much to gain, not much to lose. If you can get one with good fade and float roughly at buff price, that would be **my** personal choice if I'd wanna take a low risk low reward approach. Assuming you mean the BFK vanilla: it's risen a lot due to the price of the breakout case. Cool knife, pattern and float doesnt matter. Since it's relatively likely that another case with the breakout knives will be released, this could keep rising.

That one I can't price, and would recommend you reach out to zipelcs {refer to paragraph much below}. Although it's a #1, it's not that popular to the point where people will flock to you. For the SG 553, I don't have an answer for you, but at least more than this [4111 RMB](https://spect.fp.ps.netease.com/file/63fb8b831d34490f411fd3b5yZ1DHjAa04) imo. I would recommend reaching out to 1 of the 3 persons below {Zipelcs still first}. For AK Fire Serpent, 0.08x cheapest listed at 7800 RMB. Headhunter foil is listed at 250 RMB. So at least 7800 RMB, and at most 7930 RMB. For the Deagle Blaze with Flammable sticker, cheapest 0.00x with sticker on same spot {best spot} listed at [4388 RMB](https://spect.fp.ps.netease.com/file/63fb6378a86d782a9aec84c3wBuGfjiw04).

You could consider between 4500 to 4900 RMB imo. For USP comparison, cheapest USP with [sticker on the spot above handle](https://spect.fp.ps.netease.com/file/6417049930422aa0b49de335zmLNP6t404) listed at 1111 RMB.

Typically, the number of liquid skins / high tier expensive skins available there is far more than the other whitelisted sites combined. E.g. 1k+ M4 Neo Noir compared to less than 200 on other Western Marketplaces. When prices are competitive, they are more accurate in general (still have to assess on some skins with common sense despite listing prices, as well).
