Then he lost his knife cause he has a gambling issue so, being the good friend I am, I gave my knife back. Then he goes and wins even bigger than before. Big as in he had a karambit fade factory new worth like $500 and a karambit phase 4 Doppler factory new worth like $450. He gave me the Doppler for free. Then he goes and wins like a factory new hot rod m4a1 and a factory new stat track fire serpent ak 47. Well some dude offered him $950 for everything he had so he made that trade only to have the dude refund his payment leaving my bro with nothing. So again I return the knife and history repeats itself with him getting a knife and giving it to me only for him to lose his and force me to give it back.

1510847251,2017-11-16,"Well, you started off pretty shit, but each one got a bit better, and the last one wasn't too bad at all. I would suggest uploading in higher resolutions (1440p and up) and also getting a cool &amp; unique intro and profile pic. (It makes you look more professional.) I like the swoopy 3rd person camera view, but don't overdo it like you did in #6. Also, don't put it in the callouts and the GOTV view like in the beginning of #7. Music isn't too bad, but it could use a little improvement. I would suggest editing in impressive looking skins (dlore instead of hyper dream, deagle blaze instead of crimson web, fire serpent AK, etc.) Also use a super high viewmodel FOV. Lastly, this isn't near as important, but get some more impressive clips to put in. Sometimes you do a great job of this, by showing a sick awp collateral on a site cache, and doing a swoopy camera angle to show it off. Other parts, it's just a single slow awp flick, which doesn't look as cool. Some do this by taking clips from professional matches, but if you're going to do pro matches, I would suggest having background music as well as commentators getting you really hyped up. That's pretty much it, so I'll link you some YT channels that I think make some really good edits that I think you could learn from. Good pro match edits: https://m.youtube.com/virrecsgo?uid=C6CbMzckAgAz-8MVul2IPA Good fov/music/impressive frags edits: https://m.youtube.com/basildoomhd?uid=Abpj6UljjAz7JvJt-yJIjg Good ""funny"" edits: https://www.youtube.com/user/Zuperstitum Overall Well-Done Edits: https://www.youtube.com/user/Reconised Miscellaneous ""God Teir"" difficult edits: https://youtu.be/HvTvgj69azc https://youtu.be/Op6kgayifzU",0.047,0.691,0.262,0.9971,2
1511612321,2017-11-25,"Ok here's your long-winded feedback. First off, the intro was sick as fuck, 10/10, no room for improvement. Now, honestly, I'm not a video editor myself. However, I can tell good from bad when I see it. This isn't too bad for a first edit. I would suggest uploading in higher resolutions (1440p, maybe even 4K at 60fps, it will make the video much more crisp and clean, and makes you look very professional. I would suggest maybe changing skins to look cooler, like Pandora's box gloves with a ak fire serpent and a karambit lore. I'm not sure how exactly it is done, but I know that it is possible to edit in different skins. Also, just to make frags look danker, type ""viewmodel_fov 100"" into your console. The choice of music is kinda bad, I would suggest looking for music on sound cloud, because sometimes you can find some good stuff on there, and none of it is copyrighted. Also, slowing down and speeding up time can have a very cool affect, maybe with the occasional rewind. I would suggest syncing the music up with the changing of time (if that sounds confusing, don't worry, I'll link you a good frag video that uses it and you'll see what I mean.) Other than that, just keep going. As you make these videos, you'll learn all sorts of new skills and tricks, and after a while they'll start to look pretty good. Hope this helped, and now Ill link you some good videos/channels that you should watch, and maybe learn a thing or two from. Go to YouTube, look up ""VirreCSGO"" ""BasildoomHD"" ""Superstitum"", and ESPECIALLY make sure to check out ""ClickyCrisp"", they all make some stunning frag montages, but they all have different ""styles"" to them. Also, send me your next edit(s) when it/they come out, and I can see you getting better and maybe give you some more feedback. Cya!",0.081,0.781,0.138,0.9726,1
