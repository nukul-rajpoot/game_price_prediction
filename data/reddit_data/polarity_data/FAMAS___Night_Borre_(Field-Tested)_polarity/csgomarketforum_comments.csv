1579784155,2020-01-23,I bought about 30 famas night borre’s just to ensure I have stake in case they blow up. So far the price is rising kindof steadily so I might sell if they reach somewhere around 40 cents. I purchased each for 0.17 cents,0.0,0.909,0.091,0.4019,1
1580796777,2020-02-04,"I personally bought somewhere around 50x Famas | Night Borre's about a week ago at 19 cents each and i relisted around 20 of them for 0.50 USD and the rest for a flat 1.00 USD. im waiting to see if anything really big happens, if they stay stagnant at around 0.50 USD than i will go ahead and list them all for that price",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5

1632684556,2021-09-26,"Depends on what you're going for and what you want your odds to be. Just before the operation I did a $5 Norse collection trade up with 2 Famas night borres and 8 P250 facility drafts. Got a factory new pathfinder and made a cool $7 profit. If you're looking for the big bucks, yeah 10 bucks isn't enough. If you're looking for a few bucks and an excuse to do a trade up, it's possible. The odds aren't great but hey, any profitable trade up doesn't exactly have great odds.",0.071,0.807,0.122,0.193,2
