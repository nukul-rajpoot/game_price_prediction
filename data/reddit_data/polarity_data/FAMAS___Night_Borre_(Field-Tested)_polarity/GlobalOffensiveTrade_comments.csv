1630203192,2021-08-29,"Per buff.163.com, I used Low Floats (mainly 0.0000x) comparisons across the following collections - Ancient (same collection), Norse / St Marc / Canals (more valuable collections) as a form of price comparison across multiple collections, for the purpose of comparing (low float consumer grade **trade up food** - if someone ever uses it for food, **albeit unlikely**). I was able to find a few comparisons **for your reference**, namely: 0.0001 P90 Ancient Earth at 26 RMB (USD4) - worse float than yours 0.00004 Nova Army Sheen (Same collection) at 150 RMB - but I don't think this is realistic (see shattered web collections below). 0.00008 SG 553 Lush Ruins (Same collection) at 100 RMB - but I don't think this is realistic (see shattered web collections below). 0.00001 Famas Night Borre (Norse Collection, most expensive among 3 Shattered Web Collections) at 199 RMB. (Yours to price below this) 0.00009 SG 553 Barricade (Norse Collection, most expensive among 3 Shattered Web Collections) at 70 RMB (Listing - not sold, hence why). 0.000026 Mac 10 Surfwood (St Marc Collection, 2nd most expensive of 3 Shattered Web collections) at 99 RMB (Listing - not sold, which I would take this over yours for trade up any day). 0.000028 Negev Boroque Sand (Canals Collection, last of Shattered Web collections) at 100 RMB (Listing - not sold, which I would take this over yours for trade up any day). I would probably price it below 100 RMB (USD15.4), and closer to 70 RMB (USD10.8). Above RMB 26 (USD4) though. For your reference.",0.13,0.862,0.008,-0.9871,2
