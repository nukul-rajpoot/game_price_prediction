1425043774,2015-02-27,"Hopefuly we won't see him again. Imo he was really anoying last night, didn't shut up for a single second and tried to be 'funny' with every single line he was saying. Which was mostly random unfunny jokes or grave overreactions about what was going on ""OOHOWOOHOHOHHO HE SHOT SOMEONE WHOOHOHO"". No analysis whatsoever or any comments about a specific play. ddk tried to be a bit more serious at some points but that usually ended by Redeye making weird sounds over what ddk was saying. A bit more laid back approach would be prefered, it's like he wasn't allowed to talk for a year and is suddenly released from his cage or something. And at least read up on teams if you're gonna cast. It made the whole night boring as hell to watch. Took me back to CoD4 where sometimes Redeye would suddenly appear as a caster and take the spotlight, instead of the important match being played.",0.094,0.837,0.069,-0.6538,2
