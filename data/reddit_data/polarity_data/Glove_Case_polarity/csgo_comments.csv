1480425876,2016-11-29,"The latest CS:GO update to hit has introduced glove skins to the game as well as improved lobby functionality. Tonight's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive update has introduced a new category of skins to the game with the addition of twenty four new gloves for players to equip. The skins are currently only available from the new case that was introduced as well, the Glove Case, which also includes seventeen new weapon skins. In addition, lobby functionality has been significantly improved with the new group lobby tab, which allows players to see and join lobbies that are hosted by players who are using a group tag from a Steam group you have in common with them; the functionality can be easily turned on or off through the game settings. Check out the full changelogs below: CSGO Introducing the Glove Case, featuring 17 community-designed weapon finishes. Unlike previous cases, the possible Special Items in the Glove Case are 24 all-new gloves. For more details click here. Introducing the Radicals Music Box, featuring 7 new StatTrak‚Ñ¢ music kits from ‚ÄúRadicals‚Äù artists. Steam Group Lobbies Players can now join lobbies created by members of their Steam Groups. For details, visit the Steam Group Lobby FAQ Added the Steam Groups tab in the Friend Lister on the Main Menu. By default, if you click Play With Friends and are displaying the Tag of one of your Steam Groups, your lobby will be broadcast to (and joinable by) members of that Steam Group. You can adjust your default lobby settings in the Game Settings menu. Looking for players from your region or who share a common interest? You can search for new Steam Groups to join, view a friends‚Äô groups by visiting their Steam Community Profile, or create a group of your own! MISC Fixed an interaction between defuse kits and water that would sometimes cause a defuse kit to be unable to be picked up. Fixed miscellaneous vulnerabilities (thanks GeekPwn). Players who get kicked from a lobby cannot rejoin for three minutes. Fixed a bug where some potted plants were playing incorrect collision sounds. Fixed a bug where some UI sounds would incorrectly spatialize immediately after player death. MAPS Dust II Removed barrels outside of doors leading into B site Blocked visibility through some props around A site Fixed some spots where C4 could get stuck Fixed some minor graphical bugs Train Fixed ladders on train cars so they no longer move the player view when attaching Added more accurate collision for various models Blocked visibility under some trains from far angles Blocked grenades entering small crawlspace near popdog ladder Raised pipes in tunnels near Ivy Fixed a spot in T spawn where weapons could not be retrieved Fixed some spots where C4 could get stuck Removed that bump in T stairs. You know the one. Fixed some surfaces playing the wrong footstep sounds Some graphical tweaks Shorttrain Updated with new content and lighting Shortdust Updated navigation mesh",0.07,0.831,0.099,0.7914,2

Opening cases isn't something that I do very frequently. It's just a little thing my friends and I do when we wanna have some luck based fun.

Next 5 games have hackers (unbelievably unlucky) and I get frustrated and decide the only thing left to do to have fun is lose some money on some case openings. I flip flop with what I want to do but was pretty set on opening case with gloves. It was between the glove case and the clutch. I chose the clutch case because it was only 14 cents a case while the gloves were $1.6 a case. The only thing I wanted from the clutch case were the vice gloves. They‚Äôre pink and go with my stat trak karambit 99% fade. I already own a single pair of vice gloves FT that I bought a year ago for $900. (Peaked at around $1800 for FT but currently about ~$1400-1500 if i‚Äôm not mistaken) The whole time i‚Äôm streaming my openings to my friends who are joking that the pink I passed by was worth $2 as a joke. They were right. Everything in the case sucked except the gloves that were in it. That‚Äôs what I was shooting for. I never gave up hope. I just focused. Sure enough the beautiful glove icon rolls over my screen and boom‚Ä¶. Vice Gloves. The only thing I notice at first is the word ‚ÄúSport Gloves‚Äù. Next I notice ‚ÄúVice‚Äù. Next I notice how clean they look. Next I check the float. OMGGGGG. Funny enough, a couple hours before opening the clutch case, my friend asked me what wear my gloves were. I told him mine were FT and that I wish I just bought a pair of MW instead. Crazy. My plan is to hold onto these bad boys forever. Clutch case goes rare hopefully by the end of the year with the introduction of the new case and the value of these go up. Of course Danger Zone could be the one case that goes rare instead, but all in all I think these are a very safe long term hold. Thanks for sharing in my excitement!",0.063,0.748,0.189,0.9941,105
