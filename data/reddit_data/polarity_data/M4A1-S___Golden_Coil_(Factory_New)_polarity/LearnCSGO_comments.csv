Here's a breakdown: Terrorist Side: * Glock 18 (Free at start of every round) * P250 * Dual Berettas * Desert Eagle * Tec-9 OR CZ-75 Auto (May only have 1 equipped) Counter-Terrorist Side: * USP-S OR P2000 (May only have 1 equipped)(Also free at every round start) * P250 * Dual Berettas * Desert Eagle * Five-seveN As for knives, they all do exactly the same thing, but some people have really expensive knives. No difference other than appearance. And no, you have to manually buy every round. 2. Map sense. Learn the maps and the routes that are most popular. Don't go that way. If you see 3 enemies, go the other way. Also, it happens to everyone. Not much you can do sometimes. 3. Yes. 100% cosmetic. No skin gives anyone an advantage at all. As for getting them, you can either buy them from the Community Market, buy and open a case (read: don't) get one in a weekly drop, or be given one in trade. As for skins, you'll get some, and they're not necessary anyways. If you really want some, wait until you can buy from the Market and do that. [CSGOStash.com](http://csgostash.com/) lists all the guns and every available skin, plus prices and what the gun looks like in whichever wear you choose. It's super helpful for when you're buying. 4. That all depends on the situation. The M4A1-S and AK47 are the main assault rifles, and the AWP is hands down the best gun in the game. But just because you can afford them doesn't mean you should buy them. If you're on a map with lots of small alleyways, (Inferno, Mirage) an AWP probably won't be as effective as an AK. Another thing to do is learn which guns are most and least effective against armored enemies. For example, the AK does massive damage, even against armored enemies, while the PP-Bizon does very small damage. I'd say to start, work on the AK and the M4.

1443805157,2015-10-02,"1. What are your methods of practicing or learning to hit head shots? I'll play DM's only going for the head, but when it comes to matches nothing seems to carry over. Is it just having not enough practice or am I doing something wrong? I'll usually just roam around the map and if they're long range I'll practice strafe shooting and if it's close/mid range then I'll usually aim for the head and if that fails drop into a crouch and spray. 2. Is there a proper way to jiggle peak? I find myself doing what I think is jiggle peaking (quickly moving left and right until I see if someone is there or not) then either dying from an awp before seeing him or not baiting out any shots until I peek enough to see him then getting shot at. Where is your crosshair at when you're jiggle peeking? Mine is usually not where the guy is at because it seems like I get more vision of the area if I'm not looking at the wall? 3. How do you prefire? Take back plat in dust 2 for example. Do I just jiggle peek then fire without registering if anyone is there? I don't really understand the method I guess. 4. What did you use before the m4 patch and what do you think about it now? I used the m4a1, switched over to the m4a4, gave the m4a1 another shot, seemed like it wasn't that bad whether holding long sites or short, then my global friend said the m4a1 sucks too much and you should be using the a1. Less damage and the rate of fire nerf was too much apparently. Thoughts? 5. How do you play when you know you're getting rushed? Let's say you're at B at dust 2. You see smokes and flashes coming in. At this point I'll let my team know I'm getting flashed/smoked then throw both my flashes into the air and stay behind whatever cover I'm in. Should I be peeking to utilize peeker's advantage or...? What about when nothing is happening, when should you ever push? What if you're holding long and get flashed while heading to A doors? Do you back off to car or do you repeek? What conditions do you push or peek? 6. What are some things about economy that you've learned since learning the basics (saving if you lose a round unless you need the rounds, anti-Eco rounds, only buying body armor against ak's when you'd rather have a nade, etc)?

1443837667,2015-10-03,"okay so here we go 1. I like to play headshot only deathmatch (a game mode) so no matter what you have to hit headshots! Even after deathmatches I still spray like an idiot as well because honestly deathmatch=/= regular CS and you *need* to spray in competitive but honestly just always focus on aiming for the head like I hype myself up ""I'm going to fucking peek long and fuck their awp up corner"" or something along the lines of that. You just gotta keep thinking about hitting headshots and spraying isn't wrong it's just wrong in certain scenarios! 2. When jiggle peeking I like to take my knife out first and quickly peek out and fall back to figure out where everyone is playing (spots and shit) and then I will quickly go for a stutter step kill (run out and hit the opposite directional to stop my character right before a shot). As you play more CS (not sure of your rank or hours) you learn what spots people play and you learn to pre aim everything even if it's through walls! You just know where the spots are and you can pre aim them. Also you will learn what spots people play most and you can just pre aim those specific ones and if they aren't there you can go for a repeek and fuck them up. 3. When you prefire you are going to assume where someone is or simply guess (makes people salty as fuck too) you just guess someone is going to be there and you just peek and immediately shoot without registering if they are there or not. Most of the time it doesn't work but occasionally you'll fuck someone up. 4. Before the nerf I was loyal to the M4A1-S but I was proficient with both m4's. After the nerf I used the M4A4 more but I learned that the A1-S isn't bad and it comes down to personal preference. I like the M4A1-S and I am used to the change now and I still use it to this day. I am a B player on Dust 2, Cache, Inferno and overpass and I alternate between the 2 but I personally prefer the M4A1-S due to it's insane accuracy and I don't spray as much so I don't need all that extra ammo! At the end of the day it comes down to what you like and what you want to use! Just experiment around until you find what you like better! 5. Okay so I play B on dust 2 in a unique fashion. I have someone watch my CT mid from window and I watch upper from fence. I would call that they are flashing in and that they are going to rush and have the window player go for a frag and then fall off if he can't defend it (yeah I'm a baiter) and then I go for the other kills due to the distraction. It's a very effective method to get kills but you have to switch it up a lot. I also play behind double stack once they know I play fence and I switch it up and go for big box, and the box in the back of plat. So what I personally due (huge word personally) I like to wait for them to pass by and go for those sneaky beaky plays or just wait for them to get into site and try to take 2 of them off guard and let the other players to the rest [dope pistol ace I got from using fence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axFa9G7vqd0) 6. I have learned that I like to buy a decoy and kevlar t side pistol and then full safe the next round and then on the last save I buy a p250 and go for a pick CT mid. decoy also makes a great fake flash btw.

In League, individual play can easily lose the game for your team but it's more rare that a good player carries. As far as difference from other shooters.. Economy is extremely important in CSGO. This plays into your second question. Simplified: You start with a small amount of money and a pistol. You get more money every time you get a kill, or when a round ends. You can then buy armor, grenades, and a better gun. If you survive a round, your items from that round carry over to the next round. The two most important guns to learn are AK-47 and M4A4(or it's silenced version, M4A1-S). Avoid the entire heavy weapons tab. SMGS are occasionally useful but DO NOT get in a habit of buying them. A lot of new players get sucked in only buying SMGs and never learning how to use the better guns. As for tips, accept that you're pure shit at the game. It'll make it a lot easier to get better. Nobody is even slightly good when they start CSGO, but if you're honest with yourself about that and active about trying to get better, you won't be bad for long. Also, when you're starting out, TAKE YOUR TIME AIMING. In lower ranks, people just fire wildly and you can usually just take a moment when you see someone to line up your crosshair with their head. When I first started, I climbed 5 ranked when I realized I could just take as much time as I needed to line up my shot before I fired because everyone was bad at that rank. Oh, and TAP your shots.

You can use [this spreadsheet](http://i.imgur.com/wGSJKl4.png) to see weapons and their corresponding reward &gt;What weapons should I start with lol. What should I avoid? Start with deciding whether to use the M4A4 or the M4A1-S. The main gun for Terrorists is the AK-47 so you should try that too.

1485806943,2017-01-30,"**CT side:** **Round 1:** Good postion but bad aiming. No counter strafing before your shots. Play some pistol FFA from time to time to get used to counter strafe with pistols and tracking heads that are moving fast. **Round 2:** Why are you not buying helemt when you buy pistols? I don't get it. Ts will have SMGs and can one shot headshot you then. A stronger buy would be vesthelm and 5-7. Or atleast vesthelm and p250 in case you have cz75 equipped. Pushing through a smoke is mostly not a good idea. **Round 3:** Wow you do a full eco. Didn't expect that, but a good decision. You will receive 2400$ for losing the eco round and have 4700$ for the buy round. You almost got him. Your aiming is very slow in reacting to moving opponents. **Round 4:** You used the same position as in the previous round. The opponents didn't happen to see you this round but doing that especially when they have guns in the next round is risky. Better safe your favourite positions for the gun rounds and play other positions when you eco. **Round 5:** When you have the money as CT buy molotov instead of he grenade or both instead of 2x flash. Those grenades are very helpful for stopping rushes and especially in retake situations. Kind of a bad timing that bomb got spottet at the same time as two Ts push your bomsite. Nice kills, but you shouldn't have chased after the 2nd guy and went towards A after you got the first kill. Though situation to do anything from. **Round 6:** You are not covering your bomsite well enough. A T moved from checkers through CT spawn and killed your teammate. You aimed too long towards B entrance and your timing was off. I think you should have been able to hear the T running past though. **Round 7:** Good rotation. **Round 8:** I would have not dropped the famas. It' still a strong weapon an economy management on CT site is important, especially considering you are playing from behind. You are risking an eco at next round, because you have 1800$ left and you will get only 1400$. Without dropping your famas you are able to get a good buy on 3 players going should you lose the round. Opponents already have 13 rounds on the board and should you lose it, you would have not much money then. Otherwise not much to say. You are always playing from the same positon. You can also change things up with heaven or CT. **Round 9:** Holding mid and agressivly repeeking if you miss your first shots is not a good idea, because your teammate at short was not close yet to trade frag. **Round 10:** Your rifling is good. Could work some on your recoil control and bullet management with M4A1-S. That's not a weapon to prefire corners. You almost got killed, because you couldn't prevent the last T get on site. **Round 11:** Your rotation to from B is too slow. You should start rotating when the frag at mid happens. You do good peeks, but your recoil control again fucks you up. **Round 12:** You are quite static as CT. You should rotate more frequently, considering mid was open was quite some time and you had 2 at B when only 1 is necessary to spot. Watch your radar more and keep and eye and what areas are cover/uncovered on the map. In the end you got 2 good kills. Your rifling looks solid. Your recoil lacks consistency. **Round 13:** You always played the same setup at B every round and this time you got punished for it. Opponents didn't fall for smoke and he and just waited for the aim duell against your teammate at checkers who was always peeking there. You also always played from the same direction so opponents where already molotoving your position. You getting one frag is nice, but the bombsite is taken. **Round 14:** Looks like the opponents did make out your bomsite as a weakpoint. Your teammate playing solo in checkers is really a risky setup. Your covering and timing from switching from corner to corner looks really weird. You don't seem to have a good overview and often let someone slip through. You should use more quick peeks without stopping just to gain information and make sure you see all the lanes constantly in shorter intervals. **Round 15:** You are good at winning duells from that position, but you are very slow to react to things happening on the map. You should realize sooner that opponents are rotating when you don't see them and re organize your setup. Be more aware of the radar and react to events happening. **Overall sumary:** Your rifling looks quite solid aside from inonsistent recoil. Your pistoling looks too much run and gun. Practice counter strafing on FFA pistol DM server. Your crosshair placemnt is ok, but could use some more work. Ultimately you want to keep it next to a corner as you are moving. You have poor economy management. Watch demos and judge your decision making as I was doing it just now. Your grenade knowledge is terrible. You should really grind guides and put effort into it. Maybe watch professionals or supreme/globals in the client watch tab. Your bomsite coverage is full of holes. You want to include more quick peeks in shorter intervals. Your awreness isn't very good. You want to react faster to events happening on the map. It looks like you are playing in tunnel vision only focussing on aiming. Your playstyle is way to static.

1486945317,2017-02-13,"**Sensitivity** Ideally you want a low effective DPI (or eDPI). DPI is the measurement of how sensitive your mouse is. When you multiply your DPI by your in game sensitivity, you get your eDPI. For example, my mouse's DPI is 800, my game sensitivity is 1.05 making my eDPI 840. The average eDPI of professional players is ~900. I would highly recommend lowering your eDPI below 1500 at the very least. A lot of new players feel like they can't turn and react quickly enough with a low sensitivity, especially in deathmatch, but in real game situations precision is more important than speed. **** **Target Practice** The basis of aim is manual dexterity. To train your dexterity, I would download [this](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=213240871&amp;searchtext=Training+aim+csgo+2) workshop map. There are a lot of settings and modes on the side, but the only things I'm concerned with are the target size, and the static target duration. Try to hit at least 20/25 targets, if the settings are too easy for you decrease either or both until you feel challenged. **** **Spray Control** Spraying is an important aspect of aim. To learn how to spray download [this](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=419404847&amp;searchtext=recoil+master) and memorize and drill the recoil patterns for these guns: AK47, M4A4/M4A1-S, Famas, Galil, UMP-45. Another way to drill spray control is to load up the Aim_botz workshop map and set the armor option to heavy armor. When I do this, I like to use the console command sv_showbullethits 1 to show where my bullets are going. **** **Aim Botz** [Aim_botz](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660&amp;searchtext=aim_botz) is an excellent map for shooting at both static and moving targets. When practicing on this map, focus on headshots, snapping from target to target as quickly as you can. **** **Fast Aim and Reflex Training** [Fast Aim and Reflex Training](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=368026786&amp;searchtext=fast+aim+and+reflex+training) is great for practicing shooting at moving targets. Once again I would focus on headshots and quickly acquiring and eliminating targets. **** **FFA DM** Valve's deathmatch is a waste of time unless your objective is getting enough experience to play level up and play competitive. Instead, you should find FFA DM servers near you to practice on. This is where you get to take all the different parts of aim you've worked on in the previous sections and put them together. You can focus on tapping if you want to improve your headshots, or you can focus on holding down mouse 1 and spraying. Whatever you do, remember that improvement is the goal. Forget about your K/D and aggressively push and take engagements. **** **Crosshair Placement** Crosshair Placement is the cerebral part of aim. The basic idea is to pre-aim where the next available target will be. Typically you want to aim at head level unless you have an AWP. Flawless crosshair placement can mitigate any deficiencies in dexterity, and is arguably the single most important component of aim. [Once you learn the basics of crosshair placement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mvXfnY8wU), the best ways to improve are to constantly focus on the concept while playing the game, and watching pros play and observe their crosshair placement.

1487511736,2017-02-19,"&gt;It seems that many casual players suggest tapping with rifles is best while those on competitive (and perhaps ESEA) servers suggest spraying with all automatic weapons. &gt;Why the discrepancy? They watch Scream (pro player known for one taps) too much and think he's a God. &gt;Why is spraying better? Assuming you aim in the general vicinity of the head, spraying eliminates a guns natural first shot inaccuracy. Only sg553 has 100% first shot accuracy and only when zoomed. Also if you miss but hit their chest, spraying finishes them off. &gt;The weapons I've been using are M4A1-S and SG 553. Is spraying more appropriate for these weapons in particular?

Secondly, I'm not really a wallbangspam type of player, I didn't find myself getting kills like that with the M4A4. Thirdly, the recoil control is so easy. I can literally spray someone down with 6 or 7 bullets from across the map, whereas with the M4A4 I feel compelled to burst, strafe, and burst again to get the kill. With the M4A1-S I can just do one semi-long burst and kill pretty reliably. Also, the silencer is a big help sometimes.

1489488787,2017-03-14,"Because Train is such a small map, the two things to do as CT is to delay any rushes, and rotate fast. T's have somewhat limited options onto pushing through unannounced. Assuming you have 2 B, and 3 A (be it pushed up A main / e-box / popdog or passive) - a push through ivy is the only chance to flank without getting spotted. If I'm awping or playing passive, I'll hang back near the buffer stop for a quick shot into A-main but mostly for info gathering for the teammate at connector. If I hear multiple grenades going off in Ivy, that leaves me close enough to support. It means I can also quickly cover pop-dog if lucky. Playing aggressive A means similarly buddying up with teammate near pop/dog e-box playing cat &amp; mouse in trains. Poor ivy guy will have to solo, so put someone with great aim, less game-sense there if possible.

Introduction to cs https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OBHvRe6-VkM Good vid that talks about the basics and mechanics. Not moving while shooting is something really important. Not sure if you've played other shooting games, but unlike those you cannot move and shoot accurately at all in this game. Even up close, freaking out and running around spraying is not as good as staying still while freaking out and spraying. Spray patterns Speaking of spraying, subscribe to this map https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=419404847 With your steam account. How to use this map https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9hHHVLnazl At the very least, learn the AK47 and M4A1s or M4A4 spray patterns. When you load the map, shoot the gun on the wall to your left to select it. These are your two main rifles to use when playing on either terrorist side (AK) or counter terrorist side (M4) The goal is to follow the green dot and get the maximum amount of bullets to land. I like to turn on the terrorist player model, to give an idea of where you're shooting when you're actually aiming at someone. For the AK47 I can rarely get 25 out of 30 to land, I think my max is 27 but the AK spray pattern is very difficult and I'm not the most amazing player. I like the M4A1s better, easier spray pattern but that vs the M4A4 is personal preference. Sensitivity https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uxBuiD11WDM This is a really long process to find a good sensitivity, I've done it myself but not for nearly as long. I've found a lower sensitivity is better to be more precise, but in the following crosshair placement video, you'll learn that that's not the most important thing. I play on 800 mouse dpi with 1.0 in game sensitivity. Crosshair placement https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OfLgNu11EZA Peeking/holding good angles https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1TbI1gk4DXg Nades https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=haWAKyn34iM (I bound x to mollys c to smokes and v to flashbangs with 4 as he grenades and cycling through.) Using nades is really important, kind of sets apart better players from people who are trying to improve. Try to learn smokes to smoke off key areas on either ct or t side on the maps you'll be playing. Quick way is to just look up ""(map name) smokes"" on YouTube. Even if you can't remember a specific smoke, just chuck a smoke somewhere you think willl block vision or flashbang before you enter an area/have to move. Molotovs are good for stopping pushes or pushing enemies out of position. HE nades are good for finishing enemies in a stuck position who you already know have low health, whether you hit them with bullets or a teammate did. Some last notes Learn the maps as best as you can. Look up callout maps for the map name, and practice using these while playing. Knowing where your enemies are and having that knowledge is important. Don't rotate sites on ct until your absolutely certain the bomb is there, so many times my teammates have switched sites too early because some nades go off, leaving the opposite site free for the taking with a slower push. The bomb literally shows up on the map when the player holding it is spotted. Self awareness goes a long way, and thinking about what you did wrong when you die is important. Did you show too much of yourself holding an angle? Did you not shiftwalk and accidentally allow your opponents to hear a footstep? Was your crosshair too low or too high?

1501973779,2017-08-05,"&gt;When do I tap/burst/spray with AK? I know it has to do with distance but I feel like bursting is fine for super long range and I can spray mid/short range, I haven't found a use for tapping. There is no definitive answer to that, there are too many variables in this game. Generally you want to focus on bursting and hitting headshots at any rage (except extremely long distances like d2 pit -&gt; goose or something). &gt;I've been practicing strafing and bursting headshots with AK but I feel the technique is much less effective when using the M4A1-S, should I just spray/burst the body with that and never go for super long range fights? If I remember correctly a1-s has high fire rate so you still want to aim for the head and kill the enemy with about two - four bullets. It shouldn't be a problem as long as your crosshair placement is fine. Aiming for the body can result in many bad habits later on. &gt;Which SMG should I use after winning the pistol round? I used to be really good with them but ever since practicing with the AK I've been horrible with them. Should I aim for body if I know the enemies are ecoing or simply always aim for the head? I haven't played in 2 years but it seems like meta has shifted towards ump, so just use that. Be more confident in your aim. Why give them the chance to kill you when you can instantly headshot them as they come out of the corner? Just aim for the head. &gt;Is the Deagle really inaccurate at times or is it just me? Sometimes when practicing with it I swear a tap from an AK would've killed them but the Deagle completely whiffs the target. Well csgo is a pretty inaccurate game in general lol. But you just need more practice. A lot of it is mental as well. If you pay close attention, you're moving your right arm differently when you're playing with deagle compared to you playing with an ak. But that's not something you should worry about just yet. &gt;I'm completely clueless on the concept of utilizing grenades. I know the importance of smokes but flashbangs seem completely useless to me when playing solo. As to HE and Mollys I always hesitate to use them because I'm scared to get caught with them in hand. Should I just not bother with them until I get to a higher rank and learn from my opponents/teammates? Flashbangs are just as necessary as smokes are. Learn a few good pop flash spots and use them in your games. Don't try to save your grenades for the next round. Just ask yourself why did you buy an HE? You bought it to deal damage. Then go through this flowchart: Will throwing it at X spot deal damage if opponents are there? Yes? - throw the nade No? - don't throw the nade. &gt;I'm scared to get caught with them in hand. I have this image in my head of you just peeking out of the corner with a nade, throwing it at your opponents face and jumping back out of vision lmao &gt;I want to use the same sensitivity as in game when using my PC normally, how would I go on about doing that? I use a 450 DPI mouse with 1.26 in game sens with raw input on. I feel like this will help me get better used to my sensitivity even if a little. No need to worry about this.

1519428710,2018-02-23,"1. The P2000 isn't exactly bad, but the only advantage it has over the USP is the extra ammo. Both are pretty good, but most people just prefer the USP. That's probably because there's no way to practice with the P2000 on community DM servers, but you can practice with the USP. There's a bug with the plugin that crashes the server if someone tries to use a P2000 while they have a USP equipped, so most servers just don't make it an option anymore. 2. The M4A1-S got nerfed back in late 2015. It now has a lower rate of fire and a bit more recoil but still has the original 20/40 ammo and the same damage. 3. The TEC-9 got nerfed a few months ago. It now has 18/90 ammo and it can't be sprayed accurately. The Five-seveN also got nerfed, but AFAIK it just got a bit more recoil. Ever since that update, people have been using the CZ even though it hasn't been changed since a slight buff (back to 12/12 ammo) shortly after it got nerfed into the ground. The UMP has had its damage dropoff increased. Typically you should go with an SMG only if you can't afford a rifle and utility, but it's also pretty standard to use the UMP/MAC-10/MP9 on anti-ecos especially the first round or 2 after winning the pistol. 4.

I've got the recoil master steam workshop map (i think that's what it's called). I'm learning the popular weapons one at a time (because of time constraints), and I started with the easiest, the m4a1-s. I haven't finished learning it, but I'll be moving onto the AK at soonish, once I'm happy with the progress on the m4a1-s. The way I look at it is to practice the spray pattern in increments. So first I hold the spray for 5 bullets (the min needed to get a kill with the m4a1s on armoured opponents with chest shots), then once I was consistently getting all the bullets in the same area, I increased to 7, then 10, and now at 15. Basically increase the number of bullets in the spray, then keep practising it till you're consistent, then increase the number of bullets again. Depending on your kinesthetic intelligence (I think that's the term), it's completely up to you on how you'd like to start. For some, it's perfectly fine to start learning all the rifles at once. For others, it would be better to learn 1 weapon at a time. It might help to turn off the spread when learning the spray patterns since the spread is RNG and there's nothing you can do about that. Will make it easier for you to learn the recoil patterns, and if you get good enough, without the spread active, literally every bullet will hit the same point, which gives a much better visual indicator of how well you're controlling the spray pattern.",0.06,0.736,0.204,0.9942,1

The enemies will be getting more difficult to hit but also you will be improving. If your HS percentage is low and 16% is really low for the M4A1S, that means you are going for the body mostly. The body is obviously much easier to hit, so that helps your accuracy, but the trade-off is that it's slower to kill compared to hitting a HS.

Secondly, I'd like to correct the mistakes in this comment (I haven't watched the replay but anyways). ""- I don't really get your economics: Why buying stuff in the pistol round at all? The Glock is fine, I guess."" Always buy stuff in the pistol round. The most common buy is a kevlar or nades/nades and a defuse kit. Some people also like to buy upgraded pistols such as the p250 or a tec/5-7/cz or even a deag, but these in my opinion are not very efficient buys as the glock and usp are one shot kills to the head (the glock doesnt one shot from a long distance, but deals a significant amount of damage anyways). ""- I get the switch to the knife or pistol, to run faster, but switching to it all the time even when you are walking doesn't make much sense to me. Maybe it's a habit? I think, the enemy can hear you, when you are switching weapons. Also, you would be a bit more calm and can focus more on the game itself instead of the mouse wheel."" Enemies cannot hear you switching your weapons, and also walking with your knife out makes you walk faster. You should obviously always have your gun out when an enemy contact is possible though. ""- I would stick for a while with a rifle which you like the most and feels good to you. That must not be an expensive one, allowing you to choose it even if the money is low. But it helps to focus on the aiming and have a reproducible good feeling across multiple rounds and not being forced to get used to a different gun. I personally like the M4A1 quite a lot, and even its not so powerful, its a solid gun to win a round with. And it's affordable, even when losing one or two rounds consecutively."" The m4a1-s is the ""standard"" ct-side rifle (along with the m4a4), a counterpart to the t-side's ak-47, which is considered the strongest automatic rifle in the game. Coming in at $3100, the m4 is also on the more expensive side of the spectrum. It's good to practice using the m4 and the ak, and i would recommend using these guns as much as possible. The galil and the famas are good budget options when the money is tight, but sticking to a suboptimal gun is not beneficial for the learning process.

1603436365,2020-10-23,"I will say the next things. Probably you will look like a clueless monkey the first matches. Even the first month or more, lol. Try not to feel bad about it. It's normal. The game has a particularly difficult curve of learning. There is always more to improve and more to learn. Did you play Crash Team Racing? It is something like that. You can win by just pressing the X and getting good items against the CPU. But when you learn powerslide it's a totally different game, and mastering it's difficult. My tips are: * Don't jump too quickly in competitive. Play a few days until you are familiarized with the maps in a casual lobby or vs bots! You can set bots difficulty. * Learn the call outs of at least one map before you play in competitive. I don't know if the callouts provided by the game are accurate, so look for it in Google. * Learn the recoils of the weapons. At least for the AK-47, M4A4/M4A1-S, Galil and Famas. * Download the next maps in workshop: 1. Aim Botz - Training (uLLeticaL) 2. Recoil Master 3. Training Center 1.5c (this I think may be helpul at first) * **PLAY WITH A MICROPHONE AND A GOOD SET OF HEADPHONES**. This is so much important. There are two things that are as or more important than aiming when you start. One is communication, the other one is being able to recognize where a sound came from. You can't do that without headphones. Playing with speakers it's no way an option. You would be amazed about how many people I see losing rounds because they play with speakers and can't recognize where the fuck a sound came from. * Try not to let you down by your teamates being toxic if you are learning. * Watch YouTube videos to learn the basics. There is a ton of content that will help you to improve, from how to peek, how to move, how to shoot. * When you think you are ready to play a competitive match, warm up a few minutes before if possible. Play deathmatch or kill a certain amount of botz in Aim Botz map, or practice a bit of aiming in training\_aim\_csgo2 map. It can make a huge difference on your match performance. * Adjust your sensitivity. Take your time in an offline map (like training\_aim\_csgo2) and try to find what sensitivity suits you. If you find that you are overpassing the target, probably you need a lower sens. If you always fall short, maybe you need to get a higher sens. A good way to find out, if not in-game, is playing Aimlab. People here probably will tell you that you don't have to do that because it isn't the same as in-game, that better practice with bots, etc. But I found that I made improvements playing that, and indeed, the game itself told me that maybe it was a good idea to get a lower sens, that actually suits me a lot right now. EDIT: **Buy Advices**: * I see a lot of lower rank players buying a PP-BIZON like a lot. The PP-Bizon is a weapon for anti-eco rounds (when you think your opponent are saving money and won't expend money that round). You can shoot with it at a target while running and still being accurate, unlike most of the other weapons, and only if your opponent hasn't a kevlar (that's why it's an anti-eco weapon) it will kill him very quickly. Usually, you can buy it if the TT lost the pistol round and didn't get to plant the C4, or if CTs didn't win the first round. But if you don't think they are going to eco, don't buy it, because agains armored opponents it probably won't do much. * In competitive, coordinate with your team the buys. Don't buy as soon as you spawn because maybe you can buy a good weapon, but if your other 4 teamates can't, isn't a good idea. You may kill a few opponents perhaps, but your tms probably won't help a lot unless they get to pick a weapon from a dead player. * If you are a CT, usually you won't buy a Helmet (except in the second round of each half). Buy only kevlar. The TT is capable of buying AK-47, which can kill you with a single headshot. That and the Deagle are the only weapons that can kill you with a one tap headshot. So, you are investing an extra $300 per round to buy something that won't save you against TTs principal rifle. * Adding to the previous ponit, if you bought kevlar, finished the round and you still got 100 points of Kevlar, you can upgrade and buy a kevlar+helmet the next round if you want, because it will cost you only $300. If your kevlar is less than 100, and you buy a Kevlar+Helmet, it will charge you with both, the helmet AND the kevlar.",0.118,0.758,0.124,-0.7485,10

It's just word acrobatics to make their talking sound better and it doesn't do anything to help the viewer at all. Simply put, the AK and M4a4 and M4a1-S are just different guns that behave differently when firing, and these differences in mechanics are what dictate a good or bad fight to take with each gun. Let's start with the AK: This gun is always a one hit kill on the head. Even with a helmet. This means an AK is great for peeking aggressively because if your aim is good enough you can even one tap an AWP. The positives for the AK - OSHS (one-shot-headshot), it's among the most accurate rifles in the game as well, it also has a lot of stopping power against armored opponents in general with body shots. The AK has negatives though. It has a lot of recoil, it's a pretty hard spray pattern to master compared to the other rifles we mentioned, and it's only available on T side unless you can kill a T and grab one while on CT side. It has a bit more risk compared to reward when compared with the M4 family in CS:GO - it's got a lot of stopping power but if you miss your first shot or two on a peek, you're going to probably die due to it's hard to control recoil. The AK can be used for entry frags as a T, spraying down rushes with good recoil control, holding long on Dust2 as a CT can be a lot easier with an AK than an M4, in general longer engagements will be better with an AK. It's sort of like the ""AWP of the rifles"". The M4a4 has a bit more manageable recoil than the AK does. This is balanced out by the fact that it will only OSHS someone with no armor. You have to land 2 headshots to kill someone with armor with an M4, or silenced M4. This gun is more expensive than the AK, but has the advantage of being much better at spraying, but you don't necessarily want to be spraying with it. It's still much more effective to fire the M4a4 in bursts of 2-3 rounds while compensating slightly for the upward recoil. Do this at head height and you'll be able to stop rushes when holding a bomb site. The M4a4 is sort of a ""general purpose"" gun in that regard. The M4a1-S is even more accurate than both, but it has less ammo in each magazine. This weapon is best used on a player with very good aim, and should be used on a spot where you're going to be taking 1v1 gunfights most often, so like a mid support player on cache at whitebox or something. It has the accuracy, but low ammo, that makes 1v1 fights better. In general not as many people use this gun over the M4a4 simply because the ammo count. The M4a1-S also has the suppressor of course, which makes the gun really good at higher levels because people will be using the radar and sound cues much more often. As you rank up more you'll see more a1-S users for this reason. It can be really powerful on a lurker because of this.

I think what holds it back for me is either the recoil or mag size. I think the recoil is far too high to do anything against most of the other pistol from any range larger than Spiral to Tunnel on dust2 and the mag size (or rather the reserve ammo) seriously lets it down also. The lack of a third magazine seriously limits its potential to hold down close and busy angles and you often have to resort to finding a dropped pistol or to using your knife (which rarely ends well for the operator). Though, this could also be fixed by a boost in damage to match the Tec-9s one-hit potential. When it wants to work, it seriously does. I find it extremely easy to pull off cheeky doubles if I find the spot the enemies are least expecting me to be in. At the moment, however, I think for the majority of the playerbase the better gun is the Tec-9 and will remain this way for a long time.

So to control it, you have to pull down more. This does take some re-adjustment practicing in aimbotz &amp; deathmatch etc. so even pros who have decided to switch can't do so immediately - they need time to bed-in the new spray pattern (muscle-eye memory). niko said on his stream a month or so ago that he was switching back to the M4A4, because of the long range 2-shot kill potential and greater magazine capacity, but only after a couple tournaments were finished.

My suggestion to you is to find a weapon you are comfortable in handling. for example for me has always been the awp and m4a1s, the former being my best. Treat DM as training. find a spot where you are comfortable in the map. Always pre-peek angles where enemies may appear. Be aware of these areas in the map because you can’t always stay in the same spot as enemies will learn your style and use it against you eventually. Be unpredictable by switching places. always, always pre aim angles and stay prudent. try to avoid exposing yourself too much. and what else can i say but practice, practice, practice. Don’t expect to always have a good KD ratio. understand that there are better players out there like it or not. But it should always be about you wanting to improve. Play with confidence. I think equal in importance is when in the day you play CS. Some parts of the day your reflexes don’t match up, other parts they do. Identify those times and stick to them, though they may alter from day to day due to sleeping patterns. and keep grinding sessions limited to when you play best. Keep track of your performance each time you play and see how long that lasts. once you start seeing your performance depleting, leave whatever match you’re in, because you’re done. Shutdown the game and go do something else. Play again the next day or at a later part of the day. I hope this helps to improve your gaming in CS! Keep grinding bro💯😎",0.055,0.734,0.21,0.9963,1

1681554448.0,2023-04-15,"I havent used the default crosshair for ages, so cant help too much, but if i remember the inner points show your spread when walking (holding shift), and the outer ones your spread while running. You can swap to a traditional crosshair in settings if you like. As you can tell from the size of the outer points on the crosshair, you're really innaccurate while moving so you'll want to come to a complete stop. However even when youre standing still if you hold down the trigger your bullets wont go where your crosshair is. Fortunately, this is a predicable pattern: each gun has a recoil pattern and learning this pattern is how enemies are able to spray you down. You already know to burst fire, which is great. Do it against a wall and see where the bullets go, then do it again while pulling your mouse down. Try and get all the bullets to land in roughly 1 place, just do short burst for now. How much you need to move the mouse depends on your sensitivity so just play around with it. The main rifles people use are the AK47, the M4A4 and the M4A1-S. The M4A1-S has the least recoil so start there. You can only buy it on CT side but either team can pick it up off the floor. The in game tutorial is very lacking: there is the weapons course and bots. The best tools are made by the community and you can get them on the steam workshop. Search for Recoil Master on the steam workshop, its a great practice map. Might be a bit overwhelming at first so I'd say just experiment on your own without bots and try shooting at a wall, seeing where the bullets go and then do it again knowing how to compensate.

1684055595.0,2023-05-14,"Depends, you probably should mix it up a bit. As someone else mentioned, going M4A1-S and vest no helmet on T full buy rounds will help bridge that gap. If the T's have been super agro pushing your site, I would say your better off with an MP9 + mollys/smokes to hold off a push, even if you have to fall off, help setup with your team mates to play for a retake. If they've been less aggressive, maybe sending one lurker to your site and playing a default, and you might end up having to rotate A and engage from longer range, your probably better off with the rifle. Deagle + vest + nades could be a good alternative, I think I'd rather have a deagle if I had to engage Ts at long range vs an MP9/smg, but having the deagle with nades might also be enough to let you take out a T lurker and then you can pick up their Galili/AK/SG553 etc. Scout could also be an option. It also depends on how your communicating with your team, if your mid player get killed and drops an M4 try to grab that if you can without putting yourself into a bad spot or too out of position to cover B. Overall, If your going to be fragging out on B site, nades are more important, but D2 is a very rangey map and SMG on a rotate to A will always be tough, like others have said tho you don't have to go for every retake, if its 2v4 and the the T's have long control, and weapon advantage even if you both only have MP9's its probably smarter to just save your vest + MP9 then forcing it MAYBE dropping 1 T and having to rebuy everything when you die, if you have an M4 in that same 2v4, yeah you have more range if you go for the push, but I'd definitely try to save that 3000$ rifle if its 2v4, or 2v5 etc. CT is very economically driven, and outside of poor crosshair placement/mechanics overall one of the most common mistakes I see if CT's ALWAYS going for the retake even when the T's have a huge advantage, but if you can manage the eco properly and save, then you won't have to be making sophie's choice every round on if you should buy a rifle or nades, and you'll be able to have both. it depends mix things up and try to catch the other side off guard.",0.069,0.809,0.122,0.9525,1

1686191604.0,2023-06-08,"M4A1-S has several things going for it: 1. Cheaper. This is a huge selling point (literally). 2. Silenced = Spam through smokes. 3. Silenced = Don't pop up on radar. 4. Tighter recoil pattern. 5. More damage close up - 4 hits to body instead of 5, balanced by more damage falloff Basically, in the hands of a skilled player, the M4A1-S out-performs the A4 in many situations. You *will* see Pro players picking up the M4A4 depending upon their position, though. If you're defending B site on Dust2 for example and you know you're going to have a lot of spray down opportunities, the A4 has better overall DPS (due to higher ROF), a bigger mag, and thus makes it better for more sustained damage.

But for improvement its useless, if you wanna analyze something, go analyze pro demos(and look what they buy and when). I am not gonna look to deep into the screenshot, but since you made this post to get some kind of feadback, i will try to name some flaws i see of top of my head. 1. Mag7 useless dont even equip it, dont even think about using it haha. Use mp9 pls 2. I assume that anti$ means anti eco. In that case idk what do you want to do with 5-7 against an eco. If you play an anti eco round u probably won the last round, so you dont buy 5-7 but you buy a better weapon.(for anti eco its mp9, but there is no problem with buying famas, m4 or awp) 3. If you buy 5-7 it means you dont have a lot of money, which means you dont wanna spend any extra. Dont buy helmet with it. They probably have AK's anyways. If you can spend extra, buy deagle or mp9 4. You cannot compare he to a smoke, always buy smoke if there is not a specific plan(like all HE ramp) 5. You can play an anti eco for t as well, idk if you jjst forgot or didnt put it in on purpose, again the same story, against eco as a T you need helmet and probably best options are(mac, p90, galil, Ak, awp) 6. Deagle is insanely strong compare to how much it costs. Just saying that u have it pretty low on your rating 7. Dont have both m4's equipped, u use just 1 anyway, equip AUG or SCAR instead. Alsa unequip the mag pls haahh 8. Also idk what you mean by power rating, but mag7 is trash, and you put it higher up than tec or even deagle. Smoke is probably better than molo and he is lower, ghats why you cant have those two in the same column. Flash is right under smoke imo. You put mp9 on mag7 level and mac10 above mp9 haha.

1701134180.0,2023-11-28,"The way it feels to me is like using a laser pointer. Assuming you’re still, the first shot is dead straight. Another thing I don’t see players connect is you have like three or four different “types” of shots: 1 taps, short bursts, medium bursts, and full mag sprays. I’m just a 4,000 player but, for a beginner, I’d focus on short bursts of 2-3 bullets and learning to control that pattern first. Not only do you need to control the little bit of recoil but there’s also a cadence to how often you pull the trigger. For example, say “gimmie, gimmie, gimmie”. That’ll work for a Galil midrange with a slight pull to the lower right in groups of 3-4. M4A1-S is better with groups of 2-3 mid-to-long range. Point is you don’t need to learn the whole 30 bullet spray pattern right away. In fact, if you’re spraying full mags as a beginner, you’re probably doing something wrong.",0.059,0.887,0.054,-0.4215,1

Next practice your spray too, with AK47 especially, and the rifle you use mostly on CT, like M4A4 or M4A1-S. At last, get more game sense.
