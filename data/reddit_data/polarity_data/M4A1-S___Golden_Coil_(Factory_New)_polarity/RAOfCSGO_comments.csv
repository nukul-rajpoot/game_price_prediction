1499981375,2017-07-13,"One day in Austria, a Terrorist named Vladimir was walking down to B site to plant the bomb. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a little, brown weasel. It was the most beautiful weasel he had ever seen, with a smooth and shiny coat, dark brown eyes, and a tail as fluffy as cotton candy. He walked toward the little weasel, wishing he had something to feed it. To his surprise, the weasel did not run as he got nearer. Once he got to the weasel, he gently caressed the animal and decided he would name it Antoine and keep it as a pet. He decided he was done with his days as a terrorist and vowed to make an honest living to provide for his new furry friend. As he started to walk home, a Counter-Terrorist appeared holding an M4A1-S! Right as the Counter-Terrorist pulled the trigger of his rifle, Antoine leaped out of his masters arms and into the path of the bullet. Antoine’s little body was flung back by the bullet, his bloody body lay in the snow. Vladimir pulled out his Glock-18 pistol and put two bullets in the Counter-Terrorist’s head. As he realized his new friend Antoine was now he dead, he flew into a fit of rage and emptied the rest of his magazine into the dead Counter-Terrorist’s body. Vladimir picked up the bloodied weasel and sobbed softly. All the thoughts he had of quitting terrorism and making an honest living were gone. He picked cremated Antoine with a Molotov cocktail he had in his belt. He then picked up the bomb he had tossed to the side, planted it at B site and walked to the house of his friend, Alex. Alex was the finest artist in the country and the only one who Vladimir trusted to carry out his request. Vladimir had Alex paint a portrait of Antoine, the weasel, on his Glock-18 pistol. From that day on, Vladimir killed every Counter-Terrorist he saw with his Glock-18 | Weasel in honour of Antoine. The End. Hope you liked that story OP!

This guy randomly added me and I was like what? Okay. We struck up a discussion, asking for my mecha industries M4A1-S for his Cyrex Stattrak M4A1-S. Keep in mind that this was my first real trade discussion EVER. He linked to the real PRZEMKIE account as his ""storage"", and told me to send the trade offer to him. By the time that we finished, I got suspicious and asked my TF2 seasoned trading veteran, Soul, on his thoughts. He revealed that the account was a copy of the real account, and I immediately rescinded the offer and unftiended him. However, later, I made the same offer to the same guy again (the real account), because I wondered whether it was legit or stuff and doubted that I got get scammed in what seemed like a normal trade sequence. Nothing happened, and the guy (real account) declined the deal. I dunno what from now on now.

1509721208,2017-11-03,"1.) I use 'em back and forth, for now I'm using the USP-S because of the silenced shots, better long range engagements, and I dunno, it just feels more satisfying when hitting headshots with the USP. 2.) There are a lot of cool battle scarred skins, I would first refer to the AWP | Safari Mesh. When the float is higher, it looks all black which is pretty cool. Another one is the Tec-9 | Hades. The helmets turn into skulls when it's more battle scarred. Same goes with the P90 | Death Grip, the hands turn skeletal. One last skin I would mention is the M4A1-S | Flashback. Just feels more gritty when it's more beat up. Thank you for the giveaway :)",0.068,0.773,0.159,0.8822,1
