1490901691,2017-03-30,"1. I'd suggest cs.money but they don't accept tf2 items. Your best bet is to trade your tf2 keys into csgo keys and go from there. Also go into trade servers a lot, it's surprising how many good trades you make in there. Also I'd suggest getting a flair in r/GlobalOffensiveTrade and posting stuff there. When you do that you also get a flair in r/tf2trade 2. There is currently not a site, no. So you'll have to either do it in trading servers or post a [H] tf2 keys [W] csgo keys in the global offensive trade and the tf2 trade reddit. 3. Right now the knives that are easiest to sell I would say is vanilla knives, they are sort of like liquid items which sell for the same price most of the time. 4. Personal opinion mostly, lots of people like Karambit and M9 Bayonet's, and lots of people also like Doppler and Tiger tooth, but once again, all personal opinion. 5. It's up to you, and depends how much money you have/are willing to spend. What I would do is get a decent looking nice and get some okay playskins. Ex: a flip knife Knight ft with ak-47 elite build and m4a1s bright water, etc. 6. Float value determines the wear of the skin. So 0-0.07 is factory new, 0.07-0.15 is minimal wear, 0.15-0.37 is field tested, 0.37-0.44 is well worn, and 0.44-1.00 is battle scarred.

1490903804,2017-03-30,"Oh by the way, forgot to mention [this](https://csgo.steamanalyst.com) is csgo's version of backpack.tf. But it depends on what you're looking for. If it were me I would get a flip knife vanilla or night field tested or ultraviolet field tested then use the rest of the keys to get skins. Basically you'll want a nice ak-47 skin, and a nice m4a1s/m4a4 depending on what you prefer. But those two are the weapons you'll be mostly using, also you'll probably want a decent awp skin too. But once again this is just my opinion and it all depends on what you want, I can't pick what you like or want and don't get what other people think look good just because they said so, you pick what you like! And that's the wonders of trading, you can literally get any skin you want, there are hundreds, maybe even thousands to choose from!!!
