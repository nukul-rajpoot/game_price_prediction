1503940019,2017-08-28,"The same thing happened to me. I got an M4A1-S | Hot Rod in the new operation drop and I wanted to trade it and someone more skins for a knife. I rarely gambling or trade skins so I don't know much about it. So I just searched for a skin trading site and https://csgogem.trade/ came up. And so I traded my M4 and some other skins to this bot http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198365230779, http://imgur.com/a/xdtr6 and now I can't withdraw any items from the site, but I still have the credits on the site. http://imgur.com/a/m9x9X",0.018,0.943,0.039,0.4019,1
