1439494642,2015-08-13,"&gt;Hello, I am new to csgo, I have played cs 1.6 alot, so i have a few questions. 1. are the guns standard as back in 1.6? like ak for t and m4 for ct? or are guns more balanced that Diff between guns are lesser? 2. is there party matchmaking? 1) Yeah, the ak is on t side and for the cts you either get the m4a4 (unsilenced m4, 30 bullets per mag) or the M4a1-s (silenced M4 from 1.6, 20 bullets per mag) the guns are fairly balanced, but the ak will always be superior in CS. 2) Yeah, there is party matchmaking, you can invite friends through steam and ingame.

However they also nerfed tapping/bursting by making the recovery time (the time it takes for your gun to recover full accuracy after a shot is fired) longer (time is less significant on AK than the M4's). This is because Valve in their great genius decided that even though the people who work on the game don't play it, not to ask any pro players or casters or anyone that actually plays in the meta, what balance issues we should fix. Instead let's just nerf the guns that almost everyone uses because obviously that means they're over-powered, oh and let's add in a new gun that is complete bullshit and that no one asked for so we can make more money from all the skins.

1449724522,2015-12-10,"Hitting someone for 99 in 5 and getting 1 shotted by a secondary is a problem.... The new patch is flat out stupid. I was excited for a new gun but another powerful pistol was not what we needed. They could have added a new SMG or assault rifle, but instead add a gun that is less than half the cost of each teams base assault rifle that does way more damage. This thing is a fraction of the cost of an awp and takes no skill to use. Sure you could get 1 shorted by a deagle but it was rare compared to how often you could do it with the r8. The r8 is always a max 2 shot kill regardless of health and armor. The deagle was at least 1 shot up (very) close and multiple fat away. The r8 is too cheap for what its worth and in no circumstance should out class assault rifles that are 3x the cost. I'm not asking for it to be removed because frankly when something is added to a game it will most likely stay. However, this gun needs major work before it continues it stat in csgo. Reduce the accuracy or make it do less damage at range. Just do whatever you have to to balance the game again and prevent a handgun from outclassing every gun in the game.

Like 6 months ago (or more) it was a great gun to use if you were good at controlled short bursts - you would take an extra second and aim and a couple quick single shot taps and you could kill an enemy without having to use half your clip. It was like being rewarded for ammo conservation. 60 total rounds, you would really have to conserve in case the round went the duration. Silencer was a benefit, obviously, but I don't know if it was much of a benefit due to most maps consisting of mostly close to mid size areas. People would pretty easily know where the silenced shots were coming from. Then they nerfed the accuracy and also maybe the power... Maybe they also nerfed recovery time? It just seems a lot worse now, although I think it is still pretty decent. That is my gun of choice and I know how to use it but now I DO have to use almost half a clip to kill an enemy even if I do get a bead on their head and use very short controlled bursts. M4 is better if you prefer to spray more since it really is less accurate than the AK and the S. Now they all got nerfed again. It would be nice if just once the still grossly OP AK would get nerfed without other rifles being effected.

Enemy just runs in running and gunning with galil alone (seriously why people do these things) 4\. Second guy actually does something smarter and smokes the AWP out to get to challenge you 1v1. He should have flashed after the smoke, though doing push like that through smoke is always just stupid. You managed to kill him, good job, but why didn't you pick his AK? 5\.

Why change rifles at all? In CS:GO, spraying is generally the most popular way of firing a rifle. We can see this pretty clearly in the rifle data that we collect internally, and it’s something we hear the community discussing frequently. Because we think it’s valuable for players to have choices when they’re thinking about how to engage an opponent, we looked at ways to make tapping/bursting a bit more appealing. The hope was that by encouraging more deliberate firing, we would add something skillful that players could use to their advantage. As a first step toward this goal, we increased recoverytime for the AK-47, M4A4, and M4A1-S. For a detailed breakdown of the change and its impact, check out this excellent community post by lalush. Unfortunately, our implementation failed in a few ways. For one thing, increasing inaccuracy while spraying also comes with reduced accuracy for all forms of firing. Proportionally, spraying was the most impacted, but we underestimated the impact that the change would have on players who were already firing in shorter bursts. As it turns out, the adjustments didn’t really achieve the goal either – our rifle data shows that players in all skill groups are still spraying more than tapping or bursting. What’s next? It’s difficult to measure the impact on gameplay when too much changes at once. The Winter Update came with some really huge changes to gameplay, including a new weapon, an adjustment to pistols, and the rifle change. Since we likely changed too much too quickly, in today’s update we’re rolling back both the rifle and pistol adjustments to their pre-Winter Update state. We failed to anticipate the reaction of the community to changes in such heavy-use weapons, and we clearly need to re-evaluate our process for making and communicating about changes in that space. We still think there’s value in trying to find a better balance for pistols and more skillful ways to use rifles, so we hope to tackle rifles and pistols again in the future. We’re constantly reading community feedback and while we don’t often respond directly, understanding the community is one of the most important parts of working on CS:GO. Mistakes happen, but when they do, we’re committed to making sure they get fixed. Happy Holidays, The CS:GO Team",0.082,0.807,0.111,0.9439,2
1450245785,2015-12-16,"Going to copy and paste a comment i made on a different post.... 'll try to list some things that i've learned in my almost 1000 hours of playing. Probably the most important: Stay Calm. What i mean by this is that you shouldn't rage/shout at teammates if you're not doing so great. If you have mic-spamming teammates, mute them. If the start to grief, try to kick them. Thats why its also good to play with friends, especially in the higher ranks(Master Guardian and above) Aiming/Weapon practice. Theres nothing worse than missing an entire AK or M4 Spray and then getting insta headshotted by a FiveSeveN or Tec-9. I would try focusing on learning to control the spray patterns for the AK and M4A4(or M4A1-S, try both, its up to you which one you want to play with.) You can learn spraying with any weapon on the map Recoil Master by MrUlletical. I would also try to train One-Shot Headshots with the AK. The best way to train with real players is NOT official deathmatch, but instead deathmatch community servers. Its way better than official deathmatch imo(128tick, Instant respawn....) Map Knowledge. At the start, try to focus on one map you enjoy and want to play more on.(for me those would be Mirage, Cobblestone and Nuke) Then, try to memorize all the callouts and find some useful smokes and flashes to block off critical points of the map and delay the enemy on CT, and to gain map and bombsite control on T. There are a few maps on the workshop that teach you useful smokes/flashes/molotovs. Economy management. This one i still have to work on myself, but theres plenty of tutorials on youtube and such. Basically this is about managing your money and that of the team. Knowing when the enemy can buy or has to eco is critical. For example: the enemy has to eco and only buys P250s and Tec-9s. If you're not aware of this and can buy, you will most likely buy. In this case, the enemy has some good aiming players and can take 3or more of you out and the rest of your team has to save because they would most likely fail to retake the bombsite. Now the enemy can pick up 3 rifles and can be fully equipped while your team has to eco before buying again. Theres plenty more to the game than what i've just told you, and i'm only MGE and still have a lot to learn myself. Also, forgive the poor formatting and possible mistakes, i'm on mobile.

1451589123,2015-12-31,"I would say it depends on your play style. For pistol rounds go with a gun that fits your shooting style, if you are someone that sprays and shoots fast, go with tech9 or CZ, if you are calculating and take time with your shots, the deagle and r8 can provide quick kills against no armor and headshots. once you get the econ and are someone that prefers the close game and likes to rush, then i would start out with the pp-bizon and p90, the large mag allows for a bit more forgiveness to missed shots and the high rate of fire of the p90 will mow down people at close range. With more econ and being more of someone that takes time with shots and plays the mid game (not up close rushing but not sniping from afar) then the AK/m4a1S are good choices, you have to stop to fire as its too inaccurate while moving but a few dinks from afar is all it takes with those guns. for the rich players that like to sit back and pick from afar, AWP all the way, just note the best defense against AWP's is rushing with a P90 so awpers have to stay aware of their surroundings and cover.

1456918788,2016-03-02,"All right. What you wanna do is watch pro players from time to time. Don't do ninja defuses, everyone hates the fails unless they are funny. If you wanna improve your aim play deathmatch. Speaking of aim, always aim at the level of the head. Don't spray AKs and M4s unless you are really close. Use P90 for spraying on close range. On some maps shotguns can be really effective, but don't use them in the beginning, they are hard to use most of the time. If you decide to spray an AK at close range, shoot the first shot in the chest or head and then aim towards the legs. That is a muscle memory and you will have to move slightly to the left OR right, I'm not sure since I don't really think about it and as I said it is a muscle memory. Learn to control your shots. [Take this as an example. Just look at how he shoots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ygp6GjfLH3o) . If you use pistols with a lot of ammo like the glock, five seven and tec 9 you can afford a little bit of spray, but with USP-S, P250 and Desert Eagle, you must rely on hitting the head. The same applies to AK47 and M4A1-S on long range. M4A1-S and USP-S are by no means weapons that you can spray with. They have low amount of ammo and are deadly accurate. This is on top of my head.

1468159796,2016-07-10,"To be honest, it's going to be a rough learning curve for you. Here's the list of the Pros of the AK and M4. Pros: The Terrorist's Ak47 has the ability to 1-shot headshot almost every time from medium/long range if aimed correctly. M4 is a stronger weapon on the Counter Terrorist Side and its recoil is relatively low, along with being very consistently accurate. ----------- Cons ----------- The AK47 is very inaccurate to spray with and Spray control is a MUST-LEARN if you want to fire more than 4-5 shots in quick succession. The easiest way to get kills from medium/long is to tap fire (shoot once and wait about half a second before firing 1 more again)... The M4 will NEVER 1-hit an armored opponent. If an opponent has no armor, a headshot is a 1-hit kill. With armored enemies, you need at LEAST 1 headshot and 1 body shot to secure a kill. The recoil pattern is unique and easy to mess up when spraying. -------------------------- All-in-all, a great starter weapon is your AUG and SG 553. You can learn about tap-hitting with them. After all, the SG 553 is the MOST accurate gun (more accurate than the AWP when given lengthy tap fires) Keep practicing with your AUG/SG553 and when you feel like you're ready to learn the AK47 and M4a4 OR M4A1-S, try them. Make sure to learn their recoil patterns if you plan to spray (which is a good thing if done right!) Thanks for playing CS:GO.

Because of this, the AK and M4 both have the advantage as you save time aiming. Keep in mind that they also cost less. When covering a site, the added peripheral vision of the AK and M4's is great to have. The AK and M4's also do more damage. The AK can one tap to the head, as the SG556 can not do this. On the other side of the spectrum, the M4A1-S has very good recoil management, and has that added benefit of a silencer. I don't use the M4A4 so I can't give info on that.

1496763894,2017-06-06,"The AK47 is actually the best (arguably) weapon in the game. If you are doing low damage with it, it means your aim is off. Spend some time practicing Deathmatch. The mode you are in is ""Casual"" which is a terrible version of Competitive. Deathmatch uses no in game money and has spawns all over the map with no life limit. I would say, spend some time in Deathmatch using the AK47 and either the M4A4 or the M4A1S. You will get destroyed by anybody who knows how to aim, but that's what you're trying to learn. Also, spend some time playing offline with bots, but set the bots to ""No bots"". When you do this, pick a map and find a large flat wall. Give yourself an AK47 or M4 and shoot a hole in the wall for reference. Then look to your right and try to snap from wherever you look to put a shot on the hole. Try this looking right and left of the hole and try this while moving. Do this for a while. *If you are in a casual or competitive game mode which requires money to buy a weapon, you can can use ""cheats"" to give yourself what you need. Open up your options and under Gameplay, turn on the developer console. Then, in game, press the ""~"" key and type ""sv_cheats 1"". This will turn on cheats, but only works in offline games or private servers so you can't use this in matchmaking. Some of the commands you might want to use for practicing your shooting are: give weapon_ak47 - Gives you an AK47 | give weapon_m4a1_silencer - Gives you an M4A1S | give weapon_m4a1 - Gives you an M4A4 (I thought this was weapon_m4a4, but online it says m4a1? Can somebody confirm? I'm at work x.x) | give weapon_deagle - Gives you a Desert Eagle (really hard to use weapon, great for practice) | give weapon_flashbang - gives a flashbang | give weapon_molotov - gives a molotov (because fire) | give weapon_smokegrenade - gives a smoke grenade | mp_roundtime 60 - changes round time to 60 minutes | mp_buy_anywhere 1 | mp_buy_time 1000 | mp_maxmoney 50000 | mp_startmoney 50000 | sv_grenade_trajectory 1 - Shows you the trajectory of grenades so you can practice that. | sv_infinite_ammo 1 - infinite ammo with no reload | sv_showimpacts 1 - puts a small colored square where you bullet hits something | Any of these cheats that end with "" 1"" can be turned off by changing them to "" 0"". Most of these cheats will give you a good setup for practicing anything you want on your own server or offline. I know this was very long, but I hope it helps you set up a good practice server. You want to practice spray patterns (just stare at a wall and spray, then try it again and this time try to move the crosshair so the spray lands all the shots in one spot), grenade throws (good smokes, places you can throw good flashbangs. You may want to watch a tutorial on these. I recommend Warowl's tutorials, but there are others.), and practice landing your first 1-3 shots in the same place. Spend some time doing this then try it out in Deathmatch. You should get comfortable with the AK and the M4 because these are the backbone of Counterstrike. The AK is a 1 shot kill from any range to the head, but is slightly less accurate than the M4 which is a 2 shot kill. These are the best guns to learn, and keep in mind that your first shot is always accurate as long as you aren't moving.

1498743663,2017-06-29,"I like both and it really depends on my role or the map. If I don't know how the match will be, right now I'm using the M4a1-S, but I keep rotating them. Both do the same damage per bullet, but the a4 has a higher ROF, while the a1-S has slightly less recoil (since the weapon has more time to recover after each shot, I guess) and less damage drop-off for long distances. The recoil pattern is almost the same, but a bit more tight with the a1-S. It's also easier to remember since it has 10 less bullets. Those extra 10 bullets make a change in direction in the a4, making the spray more difficult to control, but you'll probably never spray the entire magazine, right? Right? What does all this mean? The a4 is better at defending sites and playing passively, since it's way more complicated to hold a rush with only 20 bullets per clip and only two extra clips. Those are situations where you have to hold a site, engage multiple opponents and try to delay their push until your teammates rotate, which consumes bullets. Also, the suppressor is not that useful there since they will be the ones checking all the spots, so there's no surprise factor on your side. This means it works well in places like A site on Mirage or B site/banana on Inferno. On the other hand, the a1-S is very good when you play aggressively or lurk, since you will unexpectedly catch by surprise your enemies in the open, often from the back or sides and in 1v1 or 1v2 situations. The suppressor comes really handy here, because it makes more difficult for them to know where the shots come from and, in a 1v2 situation, makes a potential trade less likely. It also tags a little bit more, so they will be less capable to find cover when you ambush them, but this is really minor. The a1-S is also not a good idea for prefiring and wallbanging, since it consumes a lot of ammo that you don't have. Other than that, ammo is rarely an issue for me, since is enough to kill 3 or even 4 enemies and you won't be the only one shooting, but if you tend to spray it might not be the best idea. Also take in mind the a1-S model is longer, so you can't hide behind corners that easily. And it's not a good idea to remove the supressor. It does NOT lower the damage output of the weapon and improves accuracy. The only advantage of removing it is a slight increase in running accuracy, but this weapon is not suited for running and gunning playstyles anyway.",0.122,0.751,0.127,-0.4259,15

1503932600,2017-08-28,"Coming into this as a relative noob (100 hours - S1 almost S2) thought this may be helpful. 1) Headshots are great, but at early levels (S1 first rank of competitive matchmaking) not essential. My H/S% is around 20%. Just make sure at the very least you are spraying the body (shots on target are key). Upper body is great as it often drifts up &amp; you get a headshot. At S2 H/S%s are higher it seems which is what I am working on now. As a noob, try using the Galil &amp; Famas rifles initially (easier spray control &amp; cheaper to re-buy as you will die a lot) before moving onto the AK &amp; M4 (would recommend the M4A1-s initially as even though its a smaller clip it has easier spray control). 2) Watch grenade &amp; flash videos on Youtube for the maps you play. You don't need to learn them all, but a couple can really help. 3) Mics are great - but I don't have one (yet) &amp; have only a couple of complaints so far. Learn the map locations so you can make the right calls e.g. ""1 palace, 30HP"" - 1 enemy in palace, with 30HP left (e.g. you've shot them for 70). Everybody seems to do something similar. Also unless you can see the bomb don't call it. Your gamesense isn't good enough yet - you don't want your team rotating away from the Bomb. 4) Don't use Auto Buy - think about what your buying &amp; don't buy to the max. every round. (Something I'm only just getting my head around). E.g. as a noob - you will die lots &amp; have no/very little money to buy guns &amp; armour with, so you will die even more. 5) At S1 &amp; in Non Prime you will get toxic teams. It happens, probably happens in Prime as well (I'm rnk 18). Try &amp; learn something its just a waste of 40mins sometimes (I've lost &amp; won 16-0 it happens). 6) Play a couple of games on each map &amp; try to focus on playing well on one side of it (e.g. A or B site) - so you have less to think about &amp; learn &amp; you can focus on improving as a player. I am still getting used to both sides of Mirage (I mostly B but can play A), Inferno I can only really play A but am OK at B. Cache I can play A OK, but will play B if it comes to it. On Cobble nobody ever really seems to play A, so I play B (4/5 rds seem to be B). Now I am a bit more comfortable with the game, I play both sides more based on where I spawn (&amp; feel I have improved as a player). You run fastest with the knife out so at early levels you can often beat people to an angle by just being quick dependant on where you spawn. If you run from the furthest point away you often need to use a smoke or a flash to play yourself in as someone from the otherside will have already beaten you to the angle and will be lined up for an entry frag. 7) In Matchmaking - if you are playing on CT &amp; are at the site &amp; haven't seen the enemy or heard (!!! - use headphones!!!) them after 30-40 seconds, chances are they are going towards the other site. Ask a teamate &amp; look to rotate. Watch your back though as T teams will often run a 4*1 split (e.g. 4 goes 1 site, 1 goes the other as a distraction). 8) Good luck, have fun &amp; enjoy the game.",0.074,0.745,0.181,0.9975,2

For example, after you send your offer, he will say that he accidentally declined or an error declined the trade, and send the same offer but with a MW ST M4A1-S Hyperbeast, in which case you would receive a skin nearly 150 dollars cheaper than you expected, but you were too excited to double-check the condition of the skin in his new offer. It doesn't seem like this is the case since he only has that one M4 in his inventory, but maybe he would decline and trade out with one of his other accounts and do exactly that.

1524539114,2018-04-24,"Many people might disagree with what I'm about to say but this is how I got good at the game so I'll post it. Try learning 1 map EXTREMELY well... For me back in 2014 this was Dust2, and more recently on Mirage. I have a total of 1900 hours on CSGO and over half of them are on Dust2. Learning one map extremely well will allow you to rankup much quicker than if you were to try and master all 7 maps in the map pool at the same time. People might say ""Whats the point of ranking up quick if you only know how to play 1 map"" The point is to rankup quick so that you face better players, which is how you progress quickly in FPS games. Once you're at about an LE level you can expand your horizon and play other maps. This is what I'm doing right now. Honestly I'm completely content playing Mirage over and over again, but I'm playing in the HSEL CSGO Spring Major and my team has to be good at 4/7 of the maps until we get to bo3 games, then we need to be good at 6/7 of the maps. Basically, once you know how to play the game well, you will know how to teach yourself to play other maps, you will know what you are lacking on other maps. There is a general game sense that players have but there is also specific map-based game sense which you can only use on the maps separately. The map-based game sense will be the only thing you are missing and it won't be too hard to learn. Then you'll be a well-rounded player :) Last little thing here, if you want to prepare to play on some sort of ESEA open team or maybe you want to play HSEL's next major in the fall, pick one of the following roles and stick to it. Awper: Uses the awp and should play around their team (is more of a high-risk high-reward position, this is where I play in my team) Rifler: Uses the rifles (AK, M4A4/M4A1-S) In Game Leader (IGL): The strat caller (should probably not be the awper) *you can't play much of the IGL when you solo queue but just try to always let your teammates know what you think they should do, what strats you should use and you'll learn from mistakes. Also you should definitely watch pro teams and learn the kinds of strats they use, this is super super important when you are IGL on a full team because you'll be teaching your team good strats* Entry Fragger (T-side): Is the first one out when you are executing a site. Support (T-side): Follows up the entry fraggers, if the entry fragger dies without a kill it's the supports job to trade them, meaning they kill the enemy that killed the entry fragger. Hopefully this helps you out a bit, if you ever start to get bored of CSGO I'd seriously recommend joining a team, it's so much more fun to play on a team than alone.",0.042,0.743,0.215,0.9987,2

1530032797,2018-06-26,"Here's some concepts that you may find useful: Crosshair placement -- This is key if you want to start scoring more. Basically, make sure you are holding any angles you could be surprised from when pushing, or backing out of an area. That means holding your crosshair around head height at the edge of corners your peak. You can find more of all of this on youtube. Movement -- Movement in CS:GO is slightly unique. The movement keys are controlled by giving you acceleration, so tapping the opposite direction of moving will make your character stop on a dime. Learning how to strafe shoot can prevent you from dying too much. Most people call this spamming 'adadad' meaning just tapping the A and D keys to stutter left and right. This not only makes you harder to hit, but also gives increased accuracy for the times you are standing still. Practice stopping on a dime, and making an accurate shot. Recoil -- Another thing somewhat unique to CS:GO are [recoil patterns](http://csgoskills.com/academy/spray-patterns/). They are memorizable, and so many people have the guns they use most frequently memorized. For example, with an M4A1-S the recoil patter goes straight up and to the right, so to counteract that, you move your mouse down and to the left during the spray. To avoid too much recoil, and when fighting at distance, try single shots, or small bursts. Watch some pro games to see how their crosshair moves when they shoot. Strategy -- There's way too much to put here, but know that counter-strike is not purely a run-n-gun game. Using grenades effectively can win games. Smokes are great, flashes are too if you're confident in your aiming and movement to get a pick on a blind guy. Some people use grenades to lure the enemy team to defend a site, and then go to the other site. Some teams will rush one site a lot, giving you a chance to rush through the other site and come from behind. Economy also plays a big part in game. If you're playing defuse games (most popular mode) you should be paying attention to your money. Look into videos on economy because it would make more sense. Some advice about economy that I can fit in here, is when trying to regain the economy lead, try certain things, like buying a good pistol and stealing an enemies weapon, asking for a buy from a teammate, buy head armour if you're Terrorist, and skip it if you're Counter-Terrorists up against AK47's and AWPS (they will always 1 shot to the head so not a big deal). Make sure you're using weapons the way they're intended, for example, rush with SMG's to get closer, medium distance for rifles, and medium to long for snipers. THE NUMBER ONE MISTAKE I SEE INEXPERIENCED PLAYERS MAKE: Making footsteps too loud. You need to know when you have time to walk somewhere, and when you need to run. Most of the time you can walk, and you should, because the enemy could be on the other side of a wall, and you just gave away your exact position. Sound queues save lives, and will get you called a wall hacker, so turn up that volume and get rid of the music (once you're comfortable with what you're doing ingame). THAT MEANS YOU YELLOW, STOP RUNNING NEXT TO ME WHILE I WALK AND GIVING AWAY MY POSITION! On another note, some people may find it hard to differentiate between one, two, or three people's footsteps. If you're teammate is running, you might be able to sneak in some run, or just letting off shift every few seconds, or alternate who runs and who walks, just do what comes natural. TL;DR Think of the game as a strategy game, do research on the base mechanics, and you'll be better off than 40% of the people you start with Watch some pro games to see what things should sorta look like, and **watch your own replays**!",0.084,0.795,0.121,0.9734,6

I'm definetly interested in how that meta evolves but regardless of the results, I will accept it. If the stats regarding the AUG (not the actual weapon stats itself but buy/kill stats) don't change in the next few weeks, it's definetly a sign that the AUG is OP and needs some fine tuning. I would love to see the M4A1-S back as a viable weapon, over the entire major so far i remember seeing only two kills made with it, which were a double kill afair.

Subscribe to the workshop maps: Aim Botz - Training by Ulletical Training_aim_csgo2 by nope and katas You can use either map, I'm only going to talk about training_aim_csgo2, for Aim Botz you would use the challenge scenario with 50 kills and note down times to reach 50 kills. Start out by just playing some rounds until you feel loose and warmed up, do not try this without first warming up or your results will be screwy. In trainging_aim set target size to 10R, number of targets to 100, interval between targets to 0.5 and static target duration to 0.5. All other options should not be changed. Get an AK or M4, your preference I prefer M4A1-S just due to it being less loud. Change your mouse sensitivity to 1 (in console command = Sensitivity 1) and then start the aim challenge. Note how many targets you hit. Repeat at sensitivities 2 &amp; 3. Do each sensitivity twice or more, but never back to back. Using your results narrow down trial sensitivities (i.e. if your highest score was sensitivity 1 then try 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5). Do each sensitivity at least twice and not back to back. Narrow results down again and use a +/- 0.25 spread from your best score (i.e. if 1.5 was your best score now try sensitivities 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75) Continuing following pattern and narrowing down until you have found your ideal sensitivity.

1579199973,2020-01-16,"I disagree with you. In my opinion, the M4A1-S has got the better skins. They look cleaner, and the shape of the rifle is more slick. Hyperbeast, Cyrex, Mecha Industries, Nightmare, Atomic Alloy. Also the rarer ones, Icarus Fell or Hot Rod are beautiful to me. The M4A4 has fewer cool skins imo. Apart from the Asiimov, there isn't much to find. Emperor, Hellfire, Desolate Space are all kind of cool but not awesome. For me, the Converter is underrated. But hey, that is all personal taste. Generally speaking, I would not switch to a weapon just because of the skin. The decision should depend on your skill and how comfortable you are playing with the weapon, not the optics. At the same time I must say I prefer the M4A4 over the M4A1-S gameplay wise, because more bullets which can prove valuable and make lots of difference in a fight. Btw I use an Evil Daimyo with some stickers (Astralis and ez pz lemon squeezy). Nothing special or stunningly looking, but not ugly either. I also have an Atomic Alloy A1-S but I rarely use it, eventhough I find that it looks better. But that's not the point. Style doesn't get me kills.",0.079,0.738,0.183,0.966,3

They try to keep the game fresh with operations (admittedly Shattered Web did take a long time but we got Danger Zone in the meantime), new game modes (DZ), new maps (Anubis, Chlorine, among many others over the years), updates to existing maps (Vertigo, Mirage), new features integrated into the game client (customising your crosshair and main menu background), keeping the gameplay fresh, balancing the meta so that (almost) every weapon has its place in the game (like the recent adjustments to the PP-Bizon, the AUG and M4A1-S buff, the SG553/Krieg controversy), and in that fashion I could keep going.

Just dont ever use autosniper in TDM because it doesnt help you learn anything and it makes you look like a tool. TDM has 2 things that are 'taboo'. Camping your spawn invincibility by not moving when you spawn, and using autosniper. I suggest practicing the M4A1-S and the AK to begin with. Master both of those guns to the point where you can get top 3 on the leaderboard every single time. Then move onto either casual games (that are a shitshow but you can still learn the maps and how to work as a team a bit) or competitive in the SCRIMMAGE maps. AKA unranked competitive.

If you arent playing at the level of like.. mid to high silver then no team will want you. The ranking system in CSGO also will F#CK YOUR ACCOUNT INTO OBLIVION if you learn in competitive. ""Rank"" is something you can fix, and change. ""Rank HEALTH"" is NOT something you can fix or improve. Youre right about casual not being a great place to learn. But there are still take-aways even in that sh#t environment. Like positioning, working as a team, noticing where your derp-squad isnt looking so you can fill holes in what is being watched / map control. Youre trying to do placement matches as a silver 1, and wondering why no one wants you on their team. Not only are you hurting your account that can never be fixed, youre also just not a good teammate right now. Do you know how to counterstrafe? Do you know about how perspectives / angles work in this game? What about right eye peeking? Plant vs after plant spots? Do you know how the movement works in this game? You dont 'want' to be placed in the lowest rank my friend, trust me. You arent going to learn ANYTHING there. If anything youre going to learn BAD HABITS that will be hard to break. Right now just stay out of comp and focus on Team Death Match. Turn off random weapon spawn, spawn with Ak47 and just work on that one gun. If youre a CT work on m4a1-s or the other rifle. Get your 'counterstrafing' down as first priority as it is the most important mechanic you should learn, as a foundation to work on other things. In TDM if you die, you just spawn again. So you can actually work on your mechanics. In comp or casual you die and youre waiting maybe a minute or more to play again. Like.. sure you can watch the 'best player' to see what they are doing well or not well, but youre still learning less muscle memory / mechanics that way compared to in TDM where you can just respawn and go try again immediately.

1598946601,2020-09-01,"1.) DONT play competitive till you have 500 hours spent OUTSIDE of comp. You have rank and you have rank HEALTH. RANK can be moved around. Rank HEALTH can NEVER be improved or fixed. So if you learn in comp, you F#CK your rank 'HEALTH' to oblivion and now it requires who knows how many games to rank up even once. Maybe it takes a spree of 20+ wins in a ROW to rank up once. 2.) To learn the fastest, play team death match. Turn off random weapon spawn. Buy an AK or M4A1-S depending on the team (Or M4A4). Spend 95% of your time at the start in TDM so you can learn the shooting mechanics and hit the ground running with becoming a better player. With AK spray just shoot 5 bullets while you pull down, then stop shooting for a tiny bit then start the process over again after re-centering your xhair. Dont try to be a hero and just hold the trigger unless they are in your face. At very long range do 1 shot or 2 shot bursts. 3.) FIRST mechanic you learn is 'counterstrafing' (youtube it) work on this 100% of the time you play TDM. This is NOT call of duty and if you move while you shoot you look like a moron because it DOES NOT WORK. DO NOT worry about other sh#t till you have this mechanic mastered. Because of counterstrafing, when you hold W and zig zag with A/D you become accurate every time you switch directions. So spray and pray with SMGs but zig zag so you can get some accurate shots in. Full run = miss every shot. 4.) Scrims are great for learning! Its 5v5 format, but no impact on your rank (or rank health like I said). 5.) Casual is a trash place for learning how a round 'should' play out, but decent practice in general for the game. Like.. 1/4th as effective practice as playing in a scrim, for example. 6.) Learn about 'right eye peeking' and watch 'war owl perspectives' video. 7.) Watch a tutorial on 'how to bunny hop in csgo'. Bind your scroll wheel either up or down to Jump. (again, youtube it). Make an autoexec.cfg and put the bind in there. Personally I have mwheeldown as jump and mwheelup as knife so I can move around very well. Even without being able to 'hit the hops' you should know how to move. Understanding air strafing and get in the habit of jumping -&gt; let go of W and synch your movement (something you will learn in the tutorials) so you can move better. You can move FASTER than default run speed when you move a certain way in the air. 8.) Where you plant the bomb is important. Where you stand AFTER you plant the bomb is also important. Your 'after plant spot' should be a spot where you are hidden from someone standing on the bomb so, in a 1v1 situation you can listen for the beep of the defuse, wait 3 seconds (takes 5s to defuse), then strafe out 1 foot then counterstrafe then take an easy shot on a stationary target. Make your CT opponent play hide and seek. If he cant find you, G\_G he will try to save or just be the easiest fish in a barrel target, ever. If hes defusing and he takes a shot at you, HIDE again. Repeat the process. He cant defuse while he shoots. This makes the game easy when the bomb is down. 9.) add the following to your autoexec: ============ // Jumpthrow bind alias +jumpthrow ""+jump;-attack"" alias -jumpthrow ""-jump"" bind ""b"" +jumpthrow //AND// // Quickswitch alias +switch ""slot3"" alias -switch ""lastinv"" bind q ""+switch"" =============== Now, when you shoot your sniper rifle you can get in the habit of pressing Q right afterwards to unscope. And when you pull the pin on a smoke grenade you can tap B to do a jumpthrow which is important for certain smoke lineups.",0.057,0.812,0.131,0.9966,3

The way the ranking system works.. if you learn in comp you will FUCK UP your account. It will CEMENT you into low silver and youll be stuck there, requiring sprees of 20++++ wins IN A ROW to rank up ONCE. Not only that, youre going to be an awful teammate and basically gimp every team you play on. Being lost as fuck and not learning anything or improving, ever. Until you can COMPETE and DESERVE your spot on a competitive team you should not play comp. That means learning EVERY mechanic, and EVERY callout, and AT BARE MINIMUM a few smoke lineups. Learn in Team Death Match. You will learn 1000x faster this way (LITERALLY) than you would in Comp or Scrim or Casual. When you DO play comp matches please play Scrims. They are unranked. Perf for learning. Put in 500 hours (till you have ALL of your mechanics down 100%), THEN play comp. If you have 500 hours but you still suck at counterstrafing you need to master it first. Honestly work on counterstrafing every single day in team death match. Its important. The first thing you should learn. Do AK47 training and M4A1-S or M4A4 in TDM, then work on P250 or Five Seven for pistols in TDM. Dont worry about awping till you are GOOD with the rifles.

1608504707,2020-12-20,"I’m gonna assume this is a legitimate question, by an actual newbie and so I will attempt to answer simply: Best long rifles are AK( t side) and M4A1-S (ct). They are effective at any range, cheap to buy, and and shoot quickly and accurately. If you are new, try the P90 for a close range SMG. The large magazine and light recoil are very forgiving for short range. Also, and indoors area (such as on office) shotguns are overpowered. Learn to use the stock usp and glock before you branch out. All guns have pros and cons, and this is especially true with pistols. Generally CSGO is a very balanced game and you cannot buy your way into god mode with weapon selection alone, especially during pistol rounds. All the grenades are useful, except maybe a decoy. If you want to start with 1, learn to use flashes. They are very powerful if used correctly and very underutilized in the lower ranks.",0.05,0.82,0.13,0.9346,6

1609103894,2020-12-27,"First things first: focus primarily on raw mechanics in the beginning. This means: Main weapons (this guide does not cover AWP, as it is more situational, and i would encourage all players without any exceptions to learn how to play rifles to at least a Master Guardian level before grapping the AWP), spray patterns, movement and firing, common weapon knowledge, economy, Pre-aiming and pre-firing, map control vs. rushing, hitboxes and damage multipliers and basics of utility usage. Main Weapons: Start out by learning AK-47 and M4A4 (i'd suggest this one, as it is my opinion that it is superior to A1), glock and USP-S. These are the weapons that win the game. The SMGs and snipers might win rounds but rifles win games! They are not in any way situational, and it is important to know how they work, which will be broken down a bit more further down. Youtube can also help a lot. Keywords for youtubing this subject could be: rifles, spray patterns, movement, strafing and counterstrafing. Worth noting in this subject: CTs default pistols (P2000 and USP-S) are 1 headshot kills, which the glock isn't (both only on enemy without helmet). AK-47 are 1 headshot kill as well, even helmeted. M4A4 and A1 are not. Always pick up an AK over an M4 at round end. always! Spray Patterns: All guns have spray patterns and spread. This is what inaccuracy is made of. Spread consists of two important factors: bullet inaccuracy and first bullet inaccuracy, but first you need to know the ""ranking"" of inaccuracy. Your accuracy increases when doing anything that is ***not*** being crouched and sitting still while firing one bullet at a time. Standing up: decreases accuracy ever so slightly, movement: decreases accuracy drastically on rifles and snipers, but less on SMGs and basically not on shotguns, jumping: fucks the aim of anything else than shotguns and MP9 and Mac-10, being on a latter: fucks aim on anything else than shotguns and revolver, etc. Spray pattern is a set pattern that the bullets after the first one goes in. These are always the same.... but. The but is spread. First bullet inaccuracy exists, which means that if you are far enough away from a subject, you are not guaranteed to land the shot, regardless of weapon and crouching. Example: you are not accurate enough with a rifle to consistently be able to shoot a guy in Dust2's A site when you are in pit if using a rifle, even if the crosshair is on him. All bullets have inaccuracy, meaning that even though the spray pattern is the same, where the bullets land will differ from spray to spray. Even taking this into consideration, learning (or just knowing in the beginning) the spray pattern will help tremendously. Movement and firing: Has been mentioned under spray pattern: running fucks your aim. stand still when you fire unless you are using shotguns, SMGs or a pistol that is not Deagle. Common Weapon Knowledge: 1) M4 needs 2 headshots to kill, are more expensive than AK but shoots a bit faster. 2) M4A1-s is silenced: no tracers through smokes to shoot at, shoots at the same rate as AK 3) Glock is basically run'n'gun. USP-S you're better off standing still or crouching 4) Spray patterns of any gun gets smaller when crouched than standing up Economy: Basically: buy when the team all have enough to buy rifles, kevlar and helmet. On CT: 4.100, on T: 3.700. Eco if you cant do that UNLESS you cant buy next round either due to loss bonus: then force. Round loss bonus build up over time: 1 lost round adds 400 to the next rounds bonus for loosing, maxing at 3.400, equating the win bonus before kill rewards. If first round of a half is lost, the loss bonus is 1.800 as the only exception. Weapons do not give the same kill reward: Rifles and P90: 300, SMGs except P90: 600, Shotguns: 900, snipers: less than rifles, i think it is 100, but i cant remember. MOST IMPORTANT: Syncronise your buy rounds, force rounds and eco rounds across the entire team, or you will constantly be at a disadvantage. oh yeah: basically: CT side have a tougher time with economy as they have to buy kit (400), mollies are more expensive at 600 compared to Ts 400 and their rifle is worse and costs 400 more. Pre-aim and Pre-fire: Basically: aim in the head, and always where it is most likely that the next enemy is coming from. If you know an enemys position, you can start firing before you spot him to have an advantage of reaction time. the rest comes with experience and youtube. Map-control vs Rushes: Be syncronised across the team. Giving opponents 1v1 fights are disadvantageous, so peek with a teammate and dont go alone into fights unless you are flashing the opponent. Decide to either go to a site or get map control. Map control grants the knowledge of whether CTs push and the advantage of 2v1 fights if they do, and you are more able to know where you are safe, and where you need to clear corners. Rushes give the advantage of outnumbering CTs as they are only 3 max on a site, due to needing to cover 2 sites. Disadvantage of this is they can use utility and know where you come from, so if you consistently do this, you're in for a world of pain. Damage multipliers and hitboxes: A player is, when it comes to the amount of damage taken, divided into 4 regions: legs, stomach, rest of the torso and head. You take base damage of the weapon minus the distance drop off in damage and minus the kevlars effect on the weapon. Different weapons are absorbed at different rates. Most important to know: Legs do 75% of base damage, torso: 100%, stomach: 125% and head: 400%. this means that headshots are FAR BETTER than anything else, but also that it takes 5 shots to the chest to kill with an M4 but only 4 to the stomach, and the Deagle kills in two shots to the stomach but 3 to the chest. Aim for the head, also when you do not see the opponent. **If you are to only take away one thing from this, let it be: AIM AT HEAD HIGHT - ALWAYS! Not only when in fight.** Basic utility: Smokes block vision, mollies do AOE damage, flashes blind and nades do direct damage. Most important here: use flashes to peak, never to hold back. Use mollies to stop rushes and smokes to stop pushes (read: mollies when you think they'd run through a smoke anyway, but else: smokes). You are always at a major disadvantage when pushing smokes so for the most parts: dont. Or at least accompany it with a flash. Oh and mollies are more expensive for CTs and they need at least a kit or two every round. &amp;#x200B; any questions?",0.16,0.755,0.085,-0.9988,2

Do you focus on one weapon for a long period of time? I think one of the biggest things is either knowing that you are versatile or focusing on a niche. Personally I am a versatile player (as are most of my friends so it works out) so we can use almost any weapon in any situation or be put anywhere on the map and do damage. But a lot of people can’t do that so learning where you play best and with what happens is very important for them. For example: if you know you do well on Mirage CT playing B with an M4A1-S, that is where you should live in games. Play retakes (I personally prefer Unoffical serves for retake) and work on improving communication. A lot of it is just knowledge and being aware of what decisions to make. But, there’s only so much you can do in SoloQ. Getting a consistent group of friends together and learning how THEY play in tandem with your style is how a lot of people get up in the higher ranks, without just having raw amazing aim. Knowing what your teammates are doing and being able to focus on other things and not feeling like you have to do everything yourself is also super helpful to rank up. You can focus on what you’re doing instead of having 6-7 different places you’re worried about in your head. If you wanna talk more, my discord is r31gn#4966.

There are lots of them, but literally all you can do is report them and keep playing, so just assume if someone beats your ass through a wall, he's just good. 2-Mute the enemy team, focus on your teammates, and try to build a non toxic squad. I think this is the most important. 3-Learn how to use this weapons: USP-S/P2K, Glock-18, M4A4/M4A1S, AK47, Five-Seven, MP9/MAC10. If you feel like you have good aim, maybe give the Deagle, SSG 08 and AWP a try. 4-Do you think your reaction time is bad? Probably it's not your reaction time, but pre-aiming and crosshair placement. Always aim where the enemy's head should be, if you're confident someone might be behind a corner, prefire. 5-Just have fun. You'll burn out pretty quickly if you take the game too seriously, at the end of the day, it's just a game. You won't get better by shooting yourself in the nuts over and over, sometimes you just have to lay off the game for a day or two. 6-And always, be nice to the people below you :)",0.114,0.709,0.177,0.9304,5

It's cluttered when you have a lot of items and it's hard to sort out which skin gives you a better boost and which skin is for which slot. My proposition is sorting by slot and showing default skins (e. g. In order - Ak-47 (def), Ak-47 (skins alphabetically or sorting by the best boost), M4A4 (def), M4A1-S (def), M4A4 and M4A1-S skins (alphabetically or sorting by the best boost), etc.) On top of that you could show whether or not the skin you are inspecting (e. g. after getting it from a case) will give you any boost over what you have currently equipped.

Additionally, CSGO has several almost entirely unique mechanics (not quite true becuase Valorant has copied them), like how CSGO does recoil or how movement affects your accuracy. The unique mechanics can make it difficult to transfer skills from other games.

The best SMG imo is the MP9 (CT side only), I would even say it is overpowered for its price were it not for the fact that the Ts have access to the one-shot-headshot AK47.

Would be the easiest way to surprise him with what he wants while not being suspicious in any way—it’s a completely normal question in csgo. As far as floats (factory new is a low float, I think .00-.07, min wear is a little more than that for a range and so on) for the most part it rarely looks that different, and is especially less noticeable in game since you aren’t really focusing as much on the skin as you would on the marketplace. Minimal wear would be completely fine for nearly any weapon, if even field tested was not good enough looking. If you have csgo, you can also view in game or simply just paste the steam id thing into a website that gives you a full 3D view of the gun (csgo doesn’t for some reason, so this is probably the better option considering you don’t even have to have steam or csgo installed.) Most people tend to like the AK more because it is a better weapon. However, in csgo matches, you have to play both sides, and only one side gets AKs and one side gets M4s. It gets much more complex, but for your case just assume he gets to use both an equal amount. So buying him the hyper beast would be a perfectly fine idea even if he likes the AK more. Someone else mentioned it, but buying a nametag would also be a pretty cool idea. You can name the skin literally anything you want, even if you just wanna title it “Happy Birthday”. TL;DR: I’d take off $2 (I think that’s the cost of nametag) from your budget and just buy whatever float/wear M4A1-S hyper beast fits with what you’re willing to spend. If you really want to buy him an AK and you can’t figure out which one he likes the best, neon rider is very similar.",0.022,0.841,0.137,0.9907,3
1633150633,2021-10-02,"Skins are just cosmetic and don't give any advantages in the game, so if it looks good - it's fine. Same goes for a wear - just pick one that doesn't look scratched. Guns don't actually wear out, they are generated with a certain wear and always remain the same. Factory new ones are usually much more expensive just because prices are regulated by players, and some people are ready to pay anything for the best option. Neon Rider is a nice choice and it looks good in minimal wear. There is also Neon Revolution with the same colors, which looks like an authentic AK covered in paint, but some people consider it too messy and chaotic. If your BF's inventory is set to public, you can check it out on his Steam page, so you know which skins he likes and which ones he already owns. If AK-47 and M4A1-S is not an option for some reason (e.g. he already has a decent skin he likes), you can't go wrong with Glock-18 or USP-S/P2000, these are free secondary pistols you carry as a backup gun most of the time. The most desired items are knives and gloves, but they're expensive as hell. You can also search for short ""[skin name] Wear/Float"" videos on YouTube to see how specific skin looks in different conditions, watch them in slow motion. Keep in mind that two identical skins of the same wear won't always look the same, they still might be slightly more or less scratched depending on the float value, matters a lot on Field-Tested and Battle Scarred ones.

Personally I switch my loadout depending on what I'm going to do next round, if I can. The M4a1-s with it's longer barrel sort of requires a different way of peeking or holding corners. Have to do it a bit wider to keep the barrel out of an opponents peek, or their sight line on the corner. It's about as long as the awp. Where the m4a4 is shorter, it gives the potential for a tighter hold, or peek. It has a more forgiving spray pattern for bursts of fire, close up, as opposed to the M4a1-s. Same for a full out spray. Tapping shots with either is more or less the same. Where the M4a1-s is more powerful, dealing more damage. It just requires using it differently in close quarters, being a long rifle. With a strong understanding of both, either can work well in close encounters. The m4a4 just has that shorter barrel advantage. There are many situations where the long barrel will give your location away in close encounters. Being aware of that can go a long way using the m4a1-s.

But if your on a tight encounter, or are unaware of an opponent near you, the opponent will in most cases see you first due to the longer barrel of the m4a1-s, as opposed to the m4a4. It's milliseconds of difference, but that time frame can make all the difference between getting a shot off on the enemy, or them getting one on you first. This is compounded in a close encounter, with peeking angles, especially ones with other sight lines. Don't always have the room or time, to get into a position to peek correctly without being spotted by the long barrel first. It's good practice to treat the M4a1-s as if you're equiped with an awp.

1664643317,2022-10-01,"Nice advice, regarding aim train there are many different opportunities. I would recommend to go download the map recoil master, this map teaches you how to controll the sprays from all guns in the game. The guns I personally would recommend you getting good at to start with is the AK-47 and M4A1-S. Eliige has a great tutorial on sprays and the map on YouTube. What I do regularly is jump into the recoil master map, do some spray training with these guns for 20-30 minutes, then I go to a death match server and practice my aim there on other players. Also, find your best mouse sensitivity, this is super important. There are plenty of guides on YouTube that are beneficial for both noobs and advanced players. Welcome to counter strike!",0.035,0.733,0.232,0.9819,7
1664661003,2022-10-01,"Since you are coming from Valorant, you'll probably have a decent enough idea on how to play in a tactical shooter. The main two things I would recommend, like a lot of others, are the workshop maps aim\_botz and recoil\_master. Use aim\_botz to get used to counter strafing and just general aim training (tho I'd assume your valo-aim should carry over) Use recoil\_master to learn recoil. I recommend playing with the settings ""Movement lock"", ""Nospread"" and ""T-Target"" enabled. Put on some music and try to spray on the Ts head (set the sound to be barely audible, otherwise its gonna be really uncomfortable for your ears after a while). Do \~15 bullet sprays at first. They are the most important and the easiest. Practice mainly with the AK and m4a1s (you might have to equip this one in your loadout as well). When using the T-Target, you should get a little statistic in the chat after every clip. You should aim for about 50% head-accuracy. Its gonna take a while, probably a few sessions, but you'll get there. As for playing against other players, deathmatch is a good place to start. Choose an ak and intentionally go for headshots as much as you can. Casual mode is also nice to get a feel for how to play in a round-based environment. It should be noted that you should treat every round in casual as a must win, no saving guns. It doesn't really matter who wins the match, just who wins each round. Before you start playing competative, play a (few) game(s) against bots on the same maps you want to play later. This will teach you both the layout and give you some idea where you can expect to encounter enemies. More things: * Use the shift key. When an enemy can hear you move, you are an easy target. Try to give away your position as little as possible * If you have the chance to reposition after a kill, do so. If you think you can hit a timing and move somewhere your opponents don't expect, do it. Essentially making A decision is usually more important than making the best decision. If you just hang around passively, more often then not the enemy has the upper hand. * Don't bait your team. You don't always have to be the first one to go in, but if someone else goes in, don't hesitate. Nothing is more infuriating than getting an entry and dying just to see your teammates haven't moved into site with you. * Make an effort to learn callouts. Its not the end of the world if you don't know everything, but if you hear someone make one and you don't know what it means, look it up later. Also communicate it if you have useful info * Learn how to use utility. I don't think it is as essential as others here seem to think. At the start, buying utility is usually just a waste of your money. Learn the mechanics of how to use them, maybe learn some basic lineups. But you'll need to get a feel for the game first before you'll be able to really use it to full effect.",0.054,0.798,0.147,0.9941,1

Some skins, however, have designs that take the weapon's shape into account, and incorporate it directly into their design, Like golden coil, Nitro and Control panel for the M4a1-S. These are the skins that I suspect will NOT be using the new weapon models, since their designs rely on the weapon's 3D model the most, and without tweaking would all look misaligned or just ""off"" to people. Of course, that's just the way it looks right now, and Valve is likely make changes to bring all skins on the new models.

You have to learn to limit yourself, 5 - 7 bullet sprays. If you're having a super hard time don't start with the ak47. Yes it's the beast mode gun but it's recoil isn't for beginners. For new players I normally advise to play casual CT and use the m4a1s as it has less recoil compared to other guns. CT also gives you defense advantages. Will help you understand the game and rotations a little better. Once you start to get the hang of it, then start experimenting with picking up other people's guns.

The mag 7 with +600.. The awp is a deep investment however, as most often never pays for itself.. this is countered by recycling the item. On rare occasions would CTs consider picking up an AK over an awp. The scout has a 1100 deficit which seems bad until you consider the trade it has over rifles. Firstly, one has to tag often and hide. It’s very passive and positioning is detrimental. But, the one thing it has it’s incredible jump accuracy, allowing CTS kill bomb planters on elevator (dust2) . the AK47 has 2100 deficit. Rifles are automatic, the AK has an incredible two shot accuracy, and not to mention its 30 round capability. This is why I think the SSG can be compared closely as the number 2 price to performance.

If you're honest with your judgement and you genuinely feel like they're running headshotting you, then they probably are. You're not crazy. I'm hard stuck between gn4 and dmg (mm moment) months after averaging 35-40 kills a game. In this rank, players movements are hilariously terrible yet they always hit their headshots. The rounds I get killed the most is when they're on CT side and coincidentally because of the m4a1s. I've never seen a gun so capable of doing consistent running headshots, I've even used it myself and confirmed it was ridiculous. I watch demos and everything is absolutely a mess. Their gamesense, crosshair placement (literally looking at floor), muscle memory, movement, logic, etc. When they happen to get a headshot with another gun like a desert eagle or AK, it looks so absurd on my screen I instinctively think he's cheating just to watch the demo to see that it was literally random luck and to result in him being bot frag after 20 rounds. Now moving on to the case of cheaters, I'm noticing there are a LOT more recently which I think it is the result of removing overwatch. I've seen 2 maybe 3 rage aimbotters and then who knows how many closet cheaters with 120 hour accounts in the past month. There are times where people really do have that defined skill to hit shots that look like running headshots because he's just that good but that running headshot you see on your screen would be network related (peelers advantage and whatever) and yes he did counterstrafe on his end. In my experience, I haven't met a lot of genuinely skilled players who have intimidating movement and such but they do exist. Just make sure to not overthink and honestly coming from me, don't listen to the people who keep saying ""oh he counterstrafed it just doesn't look like he did"". Focus on your gameplay and make sure your shots connect first before theirs do. I've asked other people if they have the same abnormal experience as I do and I get the copy and paste ""counterstrafe on his end"" as I see opponents hitting flying awp no scopes across the map and flying headshots and quad dinks with a Mac 10 across the map.",0.078,0.842,0.081,-0.1841,1
1685702449.0,2023-06-02,"Increase in player population results in increased demand for skins. I honestly have no idea if CS ever sustainably tops the current level of player activity so, demand will stay the same at least in a short to mid term. The supply of Desert Hydras might as well be considered constant in mid-term given how rare covert collection drops are. Thus, I make conclusion that in mid term you AWP would keep the same price. In the long term, provided CS lives up to this point there are a lot more factors to consider: 1. CS2 will have a new gun models which as of now are known to accept only pattern based and some simpler skins like M4A1-S Nitro. Your AWP will be on an old model in CS2 unless Valve remakes the skin for the new one. New skins will be released only for the new models. Demand for skins for new models will rise as more of them release due to people getting rid of skins for the old models which will drive down their prices. If Valve remakes your AWP skin for the new model then, your investment is probably safe. If don't then both ways. New AWP model isn't much better so, lack of remake might not reduce demand at all. Else, it will decrease in price as more AWP skins for new model come out. 2. Valve might permanently cap the supply of your AWP by updating the Mirage collection. If the best case scenario occurred in (1), e.g. skin was remade for the new model or people don't care about the old one the price will most likely increase. Everything above is said with assumption that CS will maintain popularity. If it doesn't the price will decrease.",0.059,0.845,0.096,0.9331,1
1685715903.0,2023-06-02,"General tips about the game mechanics: * Don't move while shooting * Learn the recoil for the AK and M4A1S (switch out the M4A4 for the M4A1S in the loadout section of your inventory) * You run faster with your knife out * In any non-deathmatch mode, sneak whenever you think you might be close to an enemy. Obviously with experience you'll get better at knowing when to do so, but you are usually better off with a bit of unnecessary stealth * Don't reload until you have <15 bullets in your mag and/or you have a save corner to reload in * Trade frags are some of the easiest kills you'll get. If you are behind a teammate, they walk around the corner and get killed, you should usually try to jump in behind them and try to kill the guy that killed your teammate. Its essential for good teamwork. Doing so consistently will win you games and your teammates will hate you if you don't. How I recommend going about playing the game * Start by playing Deathmatch to get a feel for the movement and guns * If you want to get better at specific things, try workshop maps to help you train. The classic ones are [aim\_botz](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660) and [recoil\_master](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=419404847) by uLLeticaL (go to steams CSGO workshop and subscribe to the maps. You can then find them in CS under the play-workshop section) * Then try playing casual. Its 10vs10, so a bit more chaotic than 5vs5, but people don't really care whether your team wins the game. As long as you try your best to win every round, people are not gonna complain to much * If you have a friend to play with, ideally one with CS experience, try playing wingman (2v2) together * When you are comfortable with the games mechanics, you can try ranked competitive. I would kinda advise against unranked, since there ranks aren't really taken into consideration, so you will often end up playing against people with 1000s of hours in the game",0.106,0.696,0.198,0.9875,2
1685717087.0,2023-06-02,"As someone who played competitive CoD for years. Going to LAN’s, online tournaments etc etc. When I started playing CS:GO, it was weird. The best advice I can give. Is that, it’s not fast paced in your face like CoD. It’s a more slow, methodical thought out chess game. Kind of like when you play SnD in CoD but even slower. The team’s economy matters as a whole. If 2/5 players buy guns every round and go broke every round. You won’t have an easy time. You won’t be able to buy like you want because you will be having to buy for others. Pay attention to the teams money, money varies per round. It’s not a set amount. Don’t try to rush into everything, line up your crosshair with angles in which you think people will come, headshots are crucial in this game. You could shoot someone in the body 4 times and all they have to do is dink you 1 or 2 times and you’re dead before them. All guns have different spray patterns, but they never change for the said gun. But people don’t use every gun. Mostly just SSG, AWP, Mac10, UMP45, M4A1/M4A1s, or AK47. So it’s not like you have to grind every gun and learn their spray patterns. Learn how to use utility, smokes, nades, incendiary. All very crucial to the game and how it’s played. You can smoke the opponents lines of sight from your spawn on some maps if you know how to throw it. Don’t jump shot, that will just bite you in the ass later, hard. Especially in MM when people have some skill. If people jump at me I think “free kill”. I think that’s all my advice I have to give. Just play it slow and learn all you can, this game takes real skill unlike CoD",0.093,0.81,0.097,-0.6716,2

Or collect what you think looks cool it really doesn’t matter. Do not try to time the market, time in market beats timing it.

1695007020.0,2023-09-18,"In CS2 you can equip both so just make sure you have both equipped. TLDR * M4A1-S has better overall control. No bullet tracers. It's also 200 bucks cheaper. * M4A4 has better firerate and 30 bullets. A lot of players seem to prefer the M4A1-S...because they suck. But seriously I prefer the M4A4 in the vast majority of scenarios because having 10 extra bullets is huge, having a faster firerate when you might get five man rushed is huge. You might want the A1-S If you're playing mid on most maps, outside nuke, Dust 2 Long...the entirety of Train, etc. You might want the longer range and recoil control and you're less likely to get killed by a rush. But in general the M4A4 is far more versatile provided you know the recoil pattern. So in CSGO it's what I had equipped, while in CS2 I make use of both. It's also faaar harder to do any 1v3+ clutches with the A1s because of the 20 bullet mag. Not having ammo concerns is big. Honestly the best thing about the A1-S is the lack of bullet tracers and it being cheaper. If I can't buy an A4, I buy an A1.",0.068,0.81,0.122,0.8652,1

Most people who don't use the A4 just don't know how to use it, speaking from my own 5 man anyway. While people who know both (typically) prefer the A4. I still buy it, but only to scrape a defuse kit or flash. The 20 bullet thing is just waaay too harsh. And even at long range, the A4 is typically better because of damage fall off and firerate. A headshot and 2 body shots just isn't viable against people who can aim with an AK. The A1-S has better damage up close but if you're only hitting body shots you're probably in a wild spray which the M4A4 is more suited towards anyway. Provided you have good spray control, all it really has going for it is the lack of bullet tracers, but the dynamic smokes have made that less effective than it once was too.

1700954559.0,2023-11-25,"I had great experiences with them, up until one instance where I lost 80$. The UI on mobile doesnt like autocorrect. As you adjust numbers on a sale, it will change your digit placement. That is if you dont type it in under 3 seconds. This led to a digit getting erased/overwritten. I clicked sell and usually a ""This is below market value, are you sure you want to sell?"" (or something like that) confirmation would pop up, but it didnt. No confirmation popped up, and just like that, with a press of a single button, an 85$ skin got sold for 8$. A lucky target buy offer snagged it in a millisecond and I couldnt do anything about it. Imagine if that happened on a knife or gloves! Im just glad it was a ST FN M4A1-S Decimator and not a more expensive skin. I tried contacting DMarket with little expectation of remedy, I was correct. Not just that but their KYC is much more invasive than Skinport or CSFloat. DMarket is big and has decent fees if the skin is a hot item. Skinport takes less money from withdrawal and deposits. CSFloat has amazing fees but the sales take a little longer though. Both however, are much less hassle and safer imo.
