You **can** use skins from other cases as well in the **mix** but it would slim down your chances for the GC. http://csgostash.com/case/80/Shadow-Case That link gives you a solid idea of what skins you would need to aquire. You can get any mix of the PURPLE skins from the shadow case. AK Frontside Misty, G3SG1 Flux, and Scout Big Iron. Keep in mind that the wear of the skins you use to trade up will also affect the wear you get for the GC. --- Information aside I have to warn you.....doing a trade up for a GC is only going to make you lose money. Any way that you see it, you will be spending more on getting the trade up skins compared to the market average price of a GC. And even if you end up with a USP Kill Confirmed, you will still be losing money from the tradeup. Personally, I do not recommend doing a tradeup just for a golden coil &gt;_&lt;",0.095,0.871,0.034,-0.941,2
