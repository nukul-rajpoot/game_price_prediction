If you want to get a chance at upgrading you'll have to use buff.163.com they only take 2.5% off your sales. Then you get balance by selling everything and then you'll habe to find something underpriced to flip for profit for example a low float skin that sells for high float price (0.16 ft gun for the price of a 0.35). Then there are ofc patterns etc but that doesnt really concern you on this level. Also keep in mind that guns with nice stickers are harder to sell because there will be less people interested. Sticker overpay is a thing many people get wrong its rarely more than 5-10% of the unapplied sticker price, also depends on the position. Dont expect any overoay for stickers below 1$. Scraped stickers are basically worthless. Best case (from own experience) was flipping a m4a1-s for 3 times market price bc of the float (0.1337)",0.078,0.811,0.111,0.7296,2
