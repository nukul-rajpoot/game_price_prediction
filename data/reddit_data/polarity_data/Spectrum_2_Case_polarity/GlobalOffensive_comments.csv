1489647932,2017-03-16,"It's a mil-spec skin. Mil-spec skins are supposed to be half fodder to keep you rolling cases for the more desired nicer ones in the case. All the more better and creative ones are designed for higher tiers in skin quality. If you look closely on workshop, there are skin creators who literally only make mil-spec tier skins with small and basic patterns and recolors, just very basic texture change, and has hundreds of them posted on workshop as they make a pattern and post 5+ recolors for each one hoping that valve picks one of them for a case. Each case has more milspec slots as well then say covert or classified so there's a higher chance of them getting picked, and it's low effort and high production with high payout possibility for these mil-spec skin creators to get some of these easy ""fodder"" skins into cases. Some of the mil spec skin creators are literally like factories, churning out hundreds of simple/low effort designs on every gun and posting multiple recolors for each one and maybe they'll get a few in every year. Here's a straight example, you know the guy who created the mp7 you're complaining about in the new case? He's one of those ""mil spec factories"", with 20 pages of skins just like that and 3-5 recolors for each skin, just look at his workshop: http://steamcommunity.com/id/aktrashheap/myworkshopfiles/ Here's another example, you see that pp bizon mil spec in this new spectrum case?

Everybody knows that there are way too many m4a1 skins and too less m4a4 skins. But they still continue to pick m4a1 skins. The AWP is okay I guess.. makes kind of sense to add a pink looking AWP after the addition of the AK Neon Revolution and the Sawed-Off Wasteland Princess. The CZ addition makes sense also but the looks of the skin isn't really good in my opinion. The M249, Mac-10, Five-Seven, P250, Sawed-Off, MP7 and Bizon skins are useless and ugly as f**k. To be honest I dont understand why they dont pick a good looking five-seven skin. The five-seven gets played a lot and all the skins are really bad compared to other weapons. The XM, Galil, Scar and Desert Eagle are okay I think. The Galil skin has some nice details but the colors are bit boring. I really like the deagle. Even thinking about getting of these.

Data consists of % per case and of skin's prices, but has no info related to how much I lose by opening 10 chroma cases vs 10 spectrum cases; or on how much more I will likely to lose by opening 1 v 2 v 10 same cases. Apart from u/v/w columns all being the same in all tabs, and apart from that probability doesn't work like that (specifically with more variables, viarables = multiple skins from different cases), you surely wanted to show which cases would be better to open to lose less money, but given you provided no factual numbers for that I don't know what am I looking at, just a spreadsheet. In my poor experience, you open one-few cases and get something shit, another day you get something good by doing the same, then you proceed to open 10+ cases just to lose, then you might open x+ cases just to open a few rare knives, then you might do the same again and knives aint coming in so you just barely equalized your spending, yet another time you lose. ~~House~~ Valve always wins.",0.139,0.805,0.057,-0.9677,5

The prisms also has the chance for new knife skins and the m4 emperor which imo is always a good bet to spend some coin on if you got it sitting around in your steam wallet.

Added in the Arms Deal update, *skins* do not enhance weapon characteristics, but instead change the visual appearance. Although some are made by Valve, the majority are made by the community and are periodically released in *cases*, available as items that drop in games. To open however, one must buy a key. This skin is *Oxide Blaze* on the Desert Eagle (occasionally shortened to *deagle*), a *Mil-Spec* skin that corresponds to the color blue. It is found in the *Spectrum Case*. The *Oxide Blaze* was later added to the XM1014 and the Glock-18 in the *Clutch Case* and *Danger Zone Case*, respectively.
