1505585168,2017-09-16,"If it was my money, I'd keep the sun in leo as the main awp, but put a fearsome in opposition sticker on the scope, the purple goes with it really well. I use the a4 so I dont have much input on a1s skins, but I love hyper beast skins so I'd go with that. For the AK I would go with a point disarray, or a wasteland rebel with a scratched drug lord or a nice shot sticker on the wood. With that combo you could afford some nicer other skins like a UMP blaze or scaffolding, or that new one from the spectrum 2 case. Scout skins are cheap so it really comes down to what you like best. If you do want a new awp skin, you have a lot of great options around $10, a fever dream, pink ddpat with some nice stickers, or my personal favorite, a high float BS awp hyper beast.
