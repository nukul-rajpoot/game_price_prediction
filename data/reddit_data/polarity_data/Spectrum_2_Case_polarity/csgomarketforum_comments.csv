1448732027,2015-11-28,"Weapon case 3 is a quite different case than Vanguard so a bit odd of a comparison. Weapon case 3 is an older case that was already discontinued before Vanguard even started to drop. It stems from a time where the playerbase &amp; demand was a looot lower. After discontinuation the (natural) demand only goes down as the case goes out of the mind of people. While the case also had a huge supply for that time (about 400K listed on the market at it's peak) while the amount of players was about 2,5 x lower compared to Vanguard's time. If you do the 400K x 2,5 that's the equavalent of 1M cases at Vanguard's time. To add to that the weapon case 3 is a pistols only case, naturally there will be less demand for it than a wider spectrum case. So it was a case with very high supply + low demand = bad demand / supply ratio, thus bad value. Any effect of quality of skins is already part of demand / supply ratio while just looking at the skins ignore so many more important factors. If a case has ""uglier"" skins &amp; 50% less demand but also 50% less supply, it will still do equally as good. Btw if cases were to stop dropping completely, the case 3 would have risen more but due to it's low demand a large % of it's supply is provided by current ""rare"" drops. Not being a rare drop is one of more reasons why sticker capsules are also doing so well.",0.146,0.807,0.048,-0.9149,1

For CS it is 45k spectrum cases sold, then ~5k of cheap cases each like gamma or glove case and like 200 bravo/weapon case 1. For H1Z1 it is 20k mercenary crates, 20k showdown, 10k br vigilante, 7k marauder and even 2k the 10$ invitational crate. So currently the sale volume for h1z1 crates is higher than compareable csgo cases get sold. This means either steamcharts numbers are very wrong and h1z1 is far more popular (what if most players have their account as private, does steamcharts track them as playing the game then?) or h1z1 is an enourmous bubble right now.

Generally the ones that works out in the short term is good for long term as well. Pro for major investment is you can usually get out within 6 months and do the next major investing. The idea of case investing I guess there are 2 sides to it. The extremely cheap cases that just got into the rare drop pool, and the ones already above 10 cent cases. The really cheap ones they might stay at the low price for years without moving a bit. But I do think if cs go keeps going strong for another 5/6 years (you need time to sell off your position as well unless you only have a few thousand cases) with similar playerbase, the cases will eventually give you 5~10 times the profit. There aren't bad cases like the revolver case these days, all the ones are decent, spectrum, chroma, gamma etc. We don't in advance whether they will be phoenix or falchion or wildfire 4/5 year later though. And you have to work on the assumption that cs go still going strong and lootboxes are not banned. Spectrum 1 is slightly different as people got into a hype with it, it could stay at this price now which is twice the price of other cheap cases or it could go up even further. In the history of pheonix case, there were multiple hypes that came down in 2014/2015. But we don't know in advance whether this is similar. Maybe the hype is caused by people finding similarity between pheonix and spectrum case both of which has a strong covert skin and a very good classified skin. Besides the really cheap cases, popular cases like pheonix and breakout cases can also be considered, just wait for them to drop a bit in price when not in hype. The benefit of these is that you know they would double in price in the next 2 years (the price is likely to jump at certain point). You have less risk since you don't have to wait 4/5 year before starting to sell. For pheonix case like case you got to look at spectrum 1,2. Spectrum 2 is still in drop though. And spectrum 1/2 is not garanteed to be the same as pheonix as AK-redline and awp asiimov are more iconic than AK47 bloodsport and AK47 empress. Fame is certainly a factor. There is no other case like breakout case yet, the only knife you can get is butterfly knife which is the most expensive old knife (with karambit as second most expensive old knife).

Chroma 3 is decent case that is about middle of the pack in terms of cases. It is still dropping in the non-prime account drop pool. Recently, it seems the demand is out-striping the supply of the more popular non-prime active drop cases like the gamma 1/2, chroma 2/3. But as with spectrum 2 case the biggest risk is valve. Valve knows which cases are popular, and it is in their interest to supply people with enough cases to open so that they get the case key money. Look at what happens with glove case, it was the 2nd more popular case to cluch and miles ahead of spectrum 2. Now that the case is more pricey, it get openned much less even falling to gamma 2 sort of level.

The finishes are Vanilla, Fade, Slaughter, Crimson web, Case hardened, Blue Steel, Night, Boreal Forest, Stained, Urban masked, Safari Mesh, Forest DDPAT and Scorched. When valve released the first 11 cases, there were 5 styles of knives: Karabit, M9 Bayonet, Bayonet, Flip and gut knife. Later on other colour patterns for this set of 5 knives appeared in cases. Firstly the Chroma cases which contains: Mable fade, Tiger Tooth, Doppler, Damascus Steel, Ultraviolet and Rust coat. Later these 6 colour patterns are referred as Chroma finishes. Secondly the Gamma cases which contains: Gamma doppler, Lore, Autotronic, Black Laminate, Freehand and Bright water. Later these 6 colour patterns are referred as Gamma finishes. The average prices of the Chroma and Gamma finishes are much greater than the 13 original colour patterns. Valve also released cases with a particular knife template and the original colour patterns. That include Butterfly Knives from breakout case, Huntsman knife from Huntsman case, Falchion knife from Falchion case, Bowie knife from Wildfire case and Shadow daggers from Shadow case. These 5 knives are grouped into Spectrum cases and the 6 colour patterns from Chroma cases are used for them. So spectrum case have the chroma finishes. There is no gamma finishes on the 5 knives so far, otherwise Gamma doppler Emerald butterfly knife would be just as popular as butterfly knife doppler (ruby/sapphire).

So spectrum 1 case is probably the best indicator of upper bound until it moves out of non-prime drop pool. It could stay in non-prime drop pool for a very long time. I also bought 20k spectrum 2 case just days before the end of operation. I thought it was possible valve could update the prime drop pool if they decides to add shattered web case into the prime drop pool.

1585739649,2020-04-01,"I disagree with the non-prime as rare claim. There are genuine accounts in non-prime, especially with chinese players. A big reason chinese players only started to boom after the free to play update was most of they didn't want to pay developer anything for a game, they were so used to pirated games. Buying skin on the other hand is perceived differently, because although it is not giving you a skill/power level advantage it is giving you an advantage in looks. So the many of the influx of chinese players are genuine non-prime people until they earned their prime status. IMO non-prime is significantly different to actual rare drop pool. If gamma 1/2 case weren't in non-prime but in rare drop pool, I think their prices would be close to wildfire case now. The non-prime drops were enough to almost satisfy the normal demand for gamma 1/2. On the other hand, just the non-prime drop will not satisfy the demand for spectrum 1/2. So the thing is kinda balanced by price. People open spectrum 2 more since some of them are discouraged by spectrum 1 case price. My predicting is spectrum 2 case price will start to catch up to spectrum 1 case. And given enough time when spectrum 2 is close to spectrum 1 price they start to move up slowly.",0.085,0.823,0.092,0.5679,1

1587326087,2020-04-19,"**Storage:** Storage units are your least expensive viable option - 1.99$ vs 5$ for an unlimited steam account.They pay for themselves (by a multiple) the moment your cases rise by just 1ct each. You could list some of your cases on the market, receive a trade offer with another 1000 cases, list them on the market again - rinse and repeat until you have listed the maximum steam wallet balance (currently $2000), then just delist them to ""bypass"" the csgo inventory limit.Please note however that your csgo inventory will be very laggy after a few thousand items and you are going to run into problems with accessing and thus listing your items for sale (in the browser/steam app!) - doesn't really look like the best thing to do here. ***TLDR -*** *Buy storage units, overall better value.* **Buy:** You can buy them on the Steam Community Market (SCM) or on other 3rd party marketplaces - please make sure to use legit ones.It's going to take a while to buy them. You could use different accounts and buy them all at once, but that's going to raise the price for a case by at least one cent and you don't really want to lose a few hundred dollars right at the start.If you want to buy 100K [Spectrum 2 cases](https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Spectrum%202%20Case) (example since it currently has the most listings on the SCM) right now, you would be paying $0.04 for \~43K cases and $0.05 for the remaining 56K cases. That's $560 down the drain because you couldn't wait a week or two for new listings. ***TLDR -*** *Buy over a longer period of time. Amount of accounts doesn't really matter if you store all of the cases in just one account - best to use more than one account for security reasons.* **Sell:** Time is the important factor yet again. You cannot just list all of them on the market (max wallet balance, price drop, etc.).Diversify where you list them and how many: SCM has a huge turnover rate for cases. The previously mentioned [Spectrum 2 case](https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Spectrum%202%20Case) sold almost 93K times in the last 24 hours!In comparison, the turnover rate on 3rd party marketplaces is a lot lower: roughly 100 sales on average per day in april for the ""marketplace with the fish"".Therefore you cannot just list 10K cases on that 3rd party site and expect it to sell at the same rate as it would on the SCM.My advice would be to sell your cases at a constant rate on the SCM, but definitely not before hitting $0.10. Otherwise the fees are +20% instead of 13% since you have to pay two parties (1ct to the publisher and 1ct to the market itself).Buy liquid items to cash out on 3rd party sites. **PROFIT!** ***TLDR -*** *The SCM is your best friend, but you have to stay friends for a few weeks.* **Listing and accepting items on the SCM and your storage units:** You can use a combination of Jessecar96's Desktop Authenticator (basically a 3rd party mobile authenticator for your PC with more flexibility) and different node modules (steam-user, globaloffensive, etc. by DoctorMcKay) to list items on the market and also store them in your storage units (new feature, added end of March I think).The developer DoctorMcKay has an active forum where he usually answers questions.

1610630841,2021-01-14,"I don't think valve completely abaddoned the idea of new gamma knives. They have been proved to be successful. I rather think valve is very cunning in do it the current way. I think before any gamma finishes, we will see shattered web case in chroma finishes at least. Maybe even another set of knife shapes followed by their chroma finish. Valve is doing it this way to prevent knife/case prices from going up fast. Imagine after a few years when spectrum cases and prisma cases are in or almost in the rare drop pool and valve start to do spectrum knives and horizon knives in gamma finishes. They are basically as popular as chroma finishes or even more popular because of the gambling factor (tiger tooth and marble fade are pretty much factory new but lore and autotranic have wide float range). Then would people pay a lot more to unbox spectrum cases or would they pay cents to unboxing prime drop gamma finish spectrum knife case? Most people will choose the latter. It won't stop spectrum cases from going up in price, but I think it will greatly slow down the growth. As for having 2 glove cases in prime drop. I don't see problem with that. Gloves were initially unpopular and have low demand hence valve slowed down from releasing them quickly. Valve may or may not do that to clutch case but they are very likely going to do that in future. We might have gen 4 glove in 2022 operation and in prime in 2023 and by then gen 3 glove would still in prime. The only reason valve might move clutch to non-prime upon introdution of broken fang glove to prime would be they are careful to test things out, to see if 1 glove case in prime and 1 glove case in non-prime over-saturate the demand. When they are confident. I definitely see valve put 2 glove cases in prime at the same time, maybe both containing gen 3 gloves. Currently, cases with glove in prime and non-prime drop pool are definitely in low supply. Clutch case constantly sell about 100,000 a day for the past 12 months. While danger zone sells 60,000, fracture being new sells 70,000 and prisma cases even less.

1613574809,2021-02-17,"Thanks for your comment. There are a few points where I definitly agree but also some which I understand but judged differently. age drives the price - absolutely if the skins are somehow interesting, no longer ""generated"" and from a old era it with less players, it already pushes the price by quite a bit. (as long as the playerbase is on such a level). without expanding this topic to much. Its a bit like a old wine. &amp;#x200B; the special items (and situational a bit the red skin) is the other price maker - absolutely, the other main factor. &amp;#x200B; Breakout &amp; Glove Case - absolutely Butterfly knife, well I guess theres nothing to say about. The gloves stuff is kinda interesting, as I got my gloves out of it it was not even 10 cents (probably still dropped during that time) but it also looks like the popularity for the gloves also just came a bit later, and was not that high in the beginning. I could be wrong obv. But at the current price.... idk if it is not really a bit to late. &amp;#x200B; falchion and shadow - meh okay, the falchion case is hard risky, your point seems legit. The knives also wont be loved in a few years and the red skins are ok. but nothing more. So it only gets influenced by the age factor, which will make it rise a bit for sure, but also definitly not go through the clouds. the shadow, at the end of 2019 they brought it back for at least half a year as a drop.. the usp is quite good and the daggers... well I definitly agree, but especially if they get more rare I see some meme potential. If that alone is enough, nobody knows. &amp;#x200B; spectrum, well it has a big mix of knives (also daggers), the key one is definitly the butterfly. Buttt, it shares the knife-pool with the spectrum 2 case which is still a non prime drop. So at the moment is has only the red skins. As soon as the spectrum 2 Case gets out of the rotation it can get very interesting. Gamma, quite the same but theres even more focus on the knives. As soon as the gamma 2 case gets out of the non prime drops and they dont release a gamma 3 case, there is good potential. CS20, i am not sure about the knives. They have their place, but also recieved some criticism. But at least till now they are exclusive for this case and the Awp is also solid. At the moment its just like betting on which of this cases is the next one who gets out of the rotation. Based on cheap data from the past, the next new case should come at the end of march or more likely in april. how many cases they will kick out then, we can only guess. but I guess not more than one, but none or even more is also possible. Probably it would not be a bad idea to split the investment a bit into this ones. Dangerzone case is with the knifes linked to the horizon case. Yeah here have the redskins maybe a bit a higher priority than at the other cases, but I still think that the big push (if it comes), will only come when both drop out. And Dangerzone is currently in prime drops, so the chances are high that it will first get moved to the non prime rotation as well. So I think at both of this cases will need a longer time than the other ones you mentioned.

And valve might even release another set of knife shapes and their chroma finishes before starting to release gamma finishs of spectrum, horizon and shattered web knives. Valve knows the gamma finishes will sell well too, and they will always be in valve's arsenal should they need them. But doing further gamma's after all the chroma finishes have the benefit of keeping more knife shapes in the active drop pool for longer. i.e. when spectrum cases become rare drops, gamma finish spectrum knife just become active prime drop.",0.093,0.833,0.074,-0.2621,6

The fact that people are aware of operation case is going to become discontinue due to Hydra/Shattered Web, is making the growth potential of BF case way lower than if this BF case undergo immediate discontinue status for the first time. Thing is, assuming BF is once again going to become discontinue right away (not exactly 100% chance), there is still a great chance of the next case or next next case to contain BF gloves that kills the potential of the BF case significantly, but I don't notice anyone talks about it at least very very little amount. I wouldn't call the situation of BF case a bubble, but a kind of schrodinger's cat situation. People are probably thinking the 3rd gen gloves from BF case will be like the 2nd gen gloves from Clutch case which is the only case that you can get 2nd gen glove from. But, if you look at the bigger picture, you will notice that Valve has never leave a jackpot item exclusively within a discontinued case or a rare case. The 2nd gen gloves is exclusively within Clutch case, but the case was in common drop pool since 2018 Feb. And the shattered web knives have already proved to us, this is the way once again, Valve just do not leave a jackpot item exclusively within a discontinued/rare source. And the reason why CS20 knives still hasn't show its face the second time, is because Valve is going to do the knife bundle thing that you see in Spectrum case but in chroma finishes. So, I honestly have no clue why people are investing into BF case knowing the risk that this case could unfold when there are plenty better option out there, plus we know sure that BF case going &gt; discontinue status is not a surprise in any way, this has happened in Hydra/Shattered Web, lots of people have invested and is priced in.

That case has some really nice knives which as far as i know only come from two boxes (spectrum 1 and spectrum 2). Spectrum 1 is discontinued (and it's increasing in price a lot) so people will be looking for the only other way to get those knives.

1622728785,2021-06-03,"Investing is any of those cases, especially ones that are near or over 50 bucks is stupid. Let's see why? You have 60 bucks now, what are you gonna invest in? 1 CS GO Weapon Case? Why, it may rise bit more? It may rise to 100 bucks? Sure, that is very possible.. You sell it at steam market for 100 bucks and u get like 87 dollars after tax. You wanna buy breakouts with that money? Sure, you get like 25 of them maybe. They rise to 5 bucks and u get 125 dollars and after tax maybe 108 dollars? Now, let's say you have 60 bucks, you can currently buy around 120 chroma 2 cases, or roughly 240 of spectrum 2 cases for that money. What is smarter investment here? Cheaper cases, why? There is higher chance that 10 cent case will go to 20 cents, 50 cent case to dollar or more than there is that near 3 dollar case will go to 5 dollars+, or 60 dollar case to 100+ dollars. Chroma 2 is not dropping anymore and it's most opened case from what was posted month/s ago. Spectrum 2 is still dropping but it has butterfly cases like Breakout and will eventually stop dropping or people will move from already expensive Breakouts to cheaper cases to get knives. Just 2 examples. You can get other cheaper cases also. I had 2000+ Breakout cases, 500 Phoenix, and some others that I sold and bought 24 000 Spectrum 2 cases, 5000 Chroma 2, 5000 Horizon (idk why I got this case, should've bought more chromas for this money lol), 1000 cs20s, etc when they were much cheaper than now. Basically again more cases you have, less they have to go up for you to make profit. This will give me more profit than 2000 Breakouts and 500 Phoenixes would give me in future.

1623333110,2021-06-10,"You can look at cases from the past year. Fine, saying stuff like Spectrum 2 case - a year ago it was for 4 cents (€; for USD you have to check on your own). For some instances you may even argue at the beginning of June it was possible to get it for 3 cents. Fair enough, few days ago was event which may not happen every year (non-prime drop pool ended), but if we still take the price from directly before - it was 21 cents (again €). So that is +425%. You can look at other cases as well to get some solid and more stable portfolio - in last year you can get to around +200% if you check cases, which are ""investing material"". So, for the sake of argument, you should devide your investment. Also the knife/skin you want to use should be of rare/discontinued collection (You can again check price changes of items in last year). Also you can kinda increase the value of the item as you are using it, so you are gaining the visual value of it, despite the item does not lose the monetary value. This second point would be most likely invalid to your dad, but you can still try with small smile on your face (maybe making some comparison to 5-10 years old cars and their new counterparts) :). Good to mention - at which point are your final values calculated? Steam value? Steam value after tax? Money on your account? Money on your account after government taxes? Decide on this point with your dad, as if you guy an item - it immediatelly loses on value (unless option A), so longer the time frame, more likely you are that you dont lose money. So, let's assume some bad case scenario, when you gonna be unlucky with your investments: so your item's price is not gonna increase in price (despite being rare .. kinda like classic knife did) and the cases would go ""only"" like +50% (because might happen to some older cases - even steam value; for other alternatives do your own calculations). So if you want to make +20%, then: x + y = 2000 and 1\*x + (3/2)\*y = 2000\*1,2 . (Otherwise put expected percentages of end timeframe to the 2nd equation.) This calculations are like 8th grade or so, so you can calculate multiple data version - just have fun with that. So yeah, as you finish this, you get to number of putting 800 € into cases and 1200 € into the desired skin. Also, buying items for short term (like a month or less) is way less of investing and more gambling - you can see items like Gamma case where the prices are almost not changing until the point when there is some sudden change (like on major person making hype one or the other way, which creates lot of motion). And few more random notes towards the end: 1st - So yeah, let me know how the talk with your dad worked out :) 2nd - I am investing usually in cases (as you probably noticed), so I dont have much experience towards items, so I cannot recomment to invest neither to not invest in any specific type of skin. 3rd - Yes, it seems it is handy to know how to solve two equaiton with two unknowns afterall :D 4th - I hope I helped you a bit and there is not much typos or sentences which are making little to no sense :D",0.025,0.794,0.181,0.9983,2

Valve would have to bundle with four other knife types like when they consolidated their previously independent knives into a “second generation” for the spectrum case. https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2017/03/18185/ Valve used to release a new knife per case like the Huntsman knife for Huntsman Case or Shadow Daggers for Shadow Case. Now, we’d need at few more independent knifes to for a “third generation”. Realistically, considering Valve preference of making entirely new knife collections over independent knives, I think that the Classic knife will forever be in its own category, and never dropped outside the CS20. I wouldn’t be surprised, however, if they copy/paste the current classic knives for a CS25/ CS30 case.",0.0,0.946,0.054,0.7096,2
1658213588,2022-07-19,"I'd recommend re-evaluating each case and it's worthiness as an investment. Here's my opinion: Spectrum 2 - In direct competition for opening with the currently dropping dreams and nightmares case for butterfly unboxing. On my roi site (CSROI.com) I've evaluated it to have the 3rd worst average return on opening of all cases, only beating the bravo and esports 2013 case. However, 70% of the value back from opening is from the $360 average knife unboxed so many, many cases need to be opened to find a possible profit. The original Spectrum case is also much healthier in terms of unboxing value, being the 14th best roi in a case. Horizon - I reckon the healthiest investment of the 3, very low cost means only a few cent increases in cost results in high profit % for investing. E.g. a 6c to 12c change in cost is only 6c but doubles the value. It has the 10th best roi from cases, with its expected return shared 40% between the knives, 60% between the skins, with all rarities having hits, the neon rider, code red, nightmare and paw all are quite desired and valuable for their rarity. Clutch - Holding this case as an investment is quite scary, it's a literal time bomb waiting for valve to remove it from the active drop pool for years. All the skins in the case hold bottom of the barrel cost due to all the years of opening creating supply. Nearly 80% of your return from opening the case is in the gloves, only 20% of your value opening the case is in the skins. Not to mention it's the 32nd worst case to open in terms of ROI. The saving grace is the gloves inside which are exclusive to the case, but the case has been in active supply so long, it probably has the same supply of gloves as other sets of cases which share rare special items between 2 cases.

One idea for cases is predicting the extremely rare special item, as the re-release of butterfly knives in operation riptide caused the spectrum cases to dip in price substantially. I think likely options for a rare special item would be: 1. a new set of knife finishes as we haven't got any new finishes since the Gamma set, which would cause a dip in OG knives such as the revolver case. 2. Chroma knife finishes on the shattered web knives, which would cause a dip in chroma cases and shattered web/fracture cases 3. Gamma knife finishes on horizon/danger zone knives, which would cause a dip in horizon/danger zone/prisma cases. 4. New glove set, which would dip the prices of any cases containing gloves 5.

1667503084,2022-11-03,"By *“true value of a case”* I mean ***“the price between the price people are not willing to sell the case at and the price people are willing to buy one”***. It does change almost every day, but It exists, and all of the factors we have talked about effect it, some more than others, and that’s what I am most interested in – How do things like “change from drop status to rare”, “a new operation coming out” and so on effect the cases, how did operation cases responded to new operation coming out in the past, is there a pattern or is it always different, things like that. In short, as I said before, I am interested in a “life cycle of a case” and what makes the market (people) pay a certain amount for a case, ***what makes people think that they will not buy one at 1.20$, won’t sell it at 1.00$, but 1.10$ seems just right.*** Again, I am not sure I will gain anything from all of this, and I am not sure I am even that interested in a possible profit from the research, I just want to understand the whole thing a bit better. I REALLY suggest you move from Excel to Google Sheets, it is very similar to Excel but has a lot more functionality and its much easier to use, if you get a hang of it. Also, it has a lot of build in functions of Google Finance. I was on Excel for a bit, before switching to Google Sheets and it made my life a LOT easier. Well, for starters, I am not using Price data, but Return data, so before calculating the correlation you will have to apply the “( New Price – Old Price ) / Old Price” formula. I will be honest, It will be extremely hard to pinpoint where your calculations differ from mine, as there are a lot of factors. 1. For example, my ***input prices are in the currency of the steam market I am using***, which is then converted into USD by Google Finance formula, that than are put into the “( New Price – Old Price ) / Old Price” formula and only then, the Monthly return is used in the correlation calculation. 2. Also, for Google Sheets, because ***I am visually rounding the numbers up to the second point***, two prices might appear the same - 0.02 and 0.02, but in reality, they are 0.022866 and 0.018671 and the Google Sheets themselves, when calculating things are using the second ones, even thought the number looks the same to you. 3. And lastly, for the first couple of month ***I was taking the prices on the 13 day of the month and not the first.*** In the grand scheme of things, It shouldn’t be a problem *(And I don’t think it is as I was taking it on the same day for all the cases)* but on such short amount of data points can make out results different. So, not sure how to compare your calculations and mine. **The order of operation should be the same thought:** * Collect the price data from each month from 01.01.2021 to 01.11.2022 * Calculate the return for each month so now it will be from 01.02.2021 to 01.11.2022 (Can’t calculate the return for the first month of 2021 as I don’t have the data of the 01.12.2020) * Put the returns of one case as the first argument in CORREL and the returns of the second case as the second argument. Here are the screenshots of the data I am using, just in case you need it: * [Price inputs](https://imgur.com/a/S8mEK4D), * [Price converted to USD](https://imgur.com/a/EfdplZT), * [Returns](https://imgur.com/a/T7xsjAE), * [Correlation of the 01.02.2022](https://imgur.com/a/mliffL2) * And for the [01.11.2022](https://imgur.com/a/d9CVnDa). You will have to zoom in on the images, as there is a lot of data, so its hard to take a good screenshot. *(Btw, I am using* [*imager site*](https://imgur.com/upload) *to upload screenshots into the posts)* The app is in VERY early stages of development, so it has very little functionality right now. As I am learning to be an Android Developer and not a data scientist, the data I am using to demonstrate how to app will work in the future is fake. Or not fake, but Hard Codded into the database. I plan to have all the things you mentioned in the application at some point. So, the app will show how much your portfolio is worth at the moment, what are your profits and losses from transactions and so on. Here is a [list of future features](https://imgur.com/a/baFQR4N) I am planning to add (The list is NOT complete). Yeah, other people investing in a case doesn’t really attracts me to one. Although I did invest in Spectrum cases and that turned out to be a good decision.

Still, like you said, this gap is quite big and I do expect it to shrink a bit more in the next few years.
